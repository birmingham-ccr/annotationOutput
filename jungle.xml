<p pid="4" id="jungle.c1.p4"><s sid="13" id="jungle.c1.s13">It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps.</s> <s sid="14" id="jungle.c1.s14">But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way.</s> <s sid="15" id="jungle.c1.s15">Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature.</s> <s sid="16" id="jungle.c1.s16">We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jungle.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="jungle.c1.s17"><qs/>"Enter, then, and look,"<qe/><sss/> said Father Wolf stiffly, <sse/><qs/>"but there is no food here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jungle.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="jungle.c1.s18"><qs/>"For a wolf, no,"<qe/><sss/> said Tabaqui, <sse/><qs/>"but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast.</s> <s sid="19" id="jungle.c1.s19">Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?"<qe/></s> <s sid="20" id="jungle.c1.s20">He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jungle.c1.p8"><s sid="26" id="jungle.c1.s26">Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces.</s> <s sid="27" id="jungle.c1.s27">It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jungle.c1.p9"><s sid="28" id="jungle.c1.s28">Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully:</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jungle.c1.p17"><s sid="48" id="jungle.c1.s48">Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jungle.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="jungle.c1.s49"><qs/>"The fool!"<qe/> said Father Wolf.</s> <s sid="50" id="jungle.c1.s50"><qs/>"To begin a night's work with that noise!</s> <s sid="51" id="jungle.c1.s51">Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jungle.c1.p20"><s sid="55" id="jungle.c1.s55">The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass.</s> <s sid="56" id="jungle.c1.s56">It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jungle.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="jungle.c1.s57"><qs/>"Man!"<qe/> said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth.</s> <s sid="58" id="jungle.c1.s58"><qs/>"Faugh!</s> <s sid="59" id="jungle.c1.s59">Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jungle.c1.p22"><s sid="60" id="jungle.c1.s60">The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe.</s> <s sid="61" id="jungle.c1.s61">The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.</s> <s sid="62" id="jungle.c1.s62">Then everybody in the jungle suffers.</s> <s sid="63" id="jungle.c1.s63">The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him.</s> <s sid="64" id="jungle.c1.s64">They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jungle.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="jungle.c1.s65">The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated <qs/>"Aaarh!"<qe/> of the tiger's charge.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="jungle.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="jungle.c1.s66">Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan.</s> <s sid="67" id="jungle.c1.s67"><qs/>"He has missed,"<qe/> said Mother Wolf.</s> <s sid="68" id="jungle.c1.s68"><qs/>"What is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="jungle.c1.p25"><s sid="69" id="jungle.c1.s69">Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="jungle.c1.p28"><s sid="74" id="jungle.c1.s74">The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap.</s> <s sid="75" id="jungle.c1.s75">Then, if you had been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the wolf checked in mid-spring.</s> <s sid="76" id="jungle.c1.s76">He made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself.</s> <s sid="77" id="jungle.c1.s77">The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing almost where he left ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="jungle.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="jungle.c1.s78"><qs/>"Man!"<qe/> he snapped.</s> <s sid="79" id="jungle.c1.s79"><qs/>"A man's cub.</s> <s sid="80" id="jungle.c1.s80">Look!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="jungle.c1.p30"><s sid="81" id="jungle.c1.s81">Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolf's cave at night.</s> <s sid="82" id="jungle.c1.s82">He looked up into Father Wolf's face, and laughed.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="jungle.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="jungle.c1.s83"><qs/>"Is that a man's cub?"<qe/> said Mother Wolf.</s> <s sid="84" id="jungle.c1.s84"><qs/>"I have never seen one.</s> <s sid="85" id="jungle.c1.s85">Bring it here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="jungle.c1.p32"><s sid="86" id="jungle.c1.s86">A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.</s> </p>
