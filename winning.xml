<title>CHAPTER I. THE OUTLAWS.</title>
<p pid="1" id="winning.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="winning.c1.s1">It was a bright morning in the month of August, when a lad of some fifteen years of age, sitting on a low wall, watched party after party of armed men riding up to the castle of the Earl of Evesham.</s> <s sid="2" id="winning.c1.s2">A casual observer glancing at his curling hair and bright open face, as also at the fashion of his dress, would at once have assigned to him a purely Saxon origin; but a keener eye would have detected signs that Norman blood ran also in his veins, for his figure was lither and lighter, his features more straightly and shapely cut, than was common among Saxons.</s> <s sid="3" id="winning.c1.s3">His dress consisted of a tight-fitting jerkin, descending nearly to his knees.</s> <s sid="4" id="winning.c1.s4">The material was a light-blue cloth, while over his shoulder hung a short cloak of a darker hue.</s> <s sid="5" id="winning.c1.s5">His cap was of Saxon fashion, and he wore on one side a little plume of a heron.</s> <s sid="6" id="winning.c1.s6">In a somewhat costly belt hung a light short sword, while across his knees lay a crossbow, in itself almost a sure sign of its bearer being of other than Saxon blood.</s> <s sid="7" id="winning.c1.s7">The boy looked anxiously as party after party rode past towards the castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="winning.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="winning.c1.s8"><qs/>"I would give something,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"to know what wind blows these knaves here.</s> <s sid="9" id="winning.c1.s9">From every petty castle in the Earl's feu the retainers seem hurrying here.</s> <s sid="10" id="winning.c1.s10">Is he bent, I wonder, on settling once and for all his quarrels with the Baton of Wortham? or can he be intending to make a clear sweep of the woods?</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c1.s11">Ah! here comes my gossip Hubert; he may tell me the meaning of this gathering."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="winning.c1.p3"><s sid="12" id="winning.c1.s12">Leaping to his feet, the speaker started at a brisk walk to meet a jovial-looking personage coming down from the direction of the castle.</s> <s sid="13" id="winning.c1.s13">The new comer was dressed in the attire of a falconer, and two dogs followed at his heels.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="winning.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="winning.c1.s14"><qs/>"Ah, Master Cuthbert,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"what brings you so near to the castle?</s> <s sid="15" id="winning.c1.s15">It is not often that you favour us with your presence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="winning.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="winning.c1.s16"><qs/>"I am happier in the woods, as you well know, and was on my way thither but now, when I paused at the sight of all these troopers flocking in to Evesham.</s> <s sid="17" id="winning.c1.s17">What enterprise has Sir Walter on hand now, think you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="winning.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="winning.c1.s18"><qs/>"The earl keeps his own counsel,"<qe/><sss/> said the falconer, <sse/><qs/>"but methinks a shrewd guess might be made at the purport of the gathering.</s> <s sid="19" id="winning.c1.s19">It was but three days since that his foresters were beaten back by the landless men, whom they caught in the very act of cutting up a fat buck.</s> <s sid="20" id="winning.c1.s20">As thou knowest, my lord though easy and well-disposed to all, and not fond of harassing and driving the people as are many of his neighbours, is yet to the full as fanatical anent his forest privileges as the worst of them.</s> <s sid="21" id="winning.c1.s21">They tell me that when the news came in of the poor figure that his foresters cut with broken bows and draggled plumes--for the varlets had soused them in a pond of not over savoury water--he swore a great oath that he would clear the forest of the bands.</s> <s sid="22" id="winning.c1.s22">It may be, indeed, that this gathering is for the purpose of falling in force upon that evil-disposed and most treacherous baron, Sir John of Wortham, who has already begun to harry some of the outlying lands, and has driven off, I hear, many heads of cattle.</s> <s sid="23" id="winning.c1.s23">It is a quarrel which will have to be fought out sooner or later, and the sooner the better, say I.</s> <s sid="24" id="winning.c1.s24">Although I am no man of war, and love looking after my falcons or giving food to my dogs far more than exchanging hard blows, yet would I gladly don the buff and steel coat to aid in levelling the keep of that robber and tyrant, Sir John of Wortham."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="winning.c1.s25"><qs/>"Thanks, good Hubert,"<qe/> said the lad.</s> <s sid="26" id="winning.c1.s26"><qs/>"I must not stand gossiping here.</s> <s sid="27" id="winning.c1.s27">The news you have told me, as you know, touches me closely, for I would not that harm should come to the forest men."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="winning.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="winning.c1.s28"><qs/>"Let it not out, I beseech thee, Cuthbert, that the news came from me, for temperate as Sir Walter is at most times, he would, methinks, give me short shift did he know that the wagging of my tongue might have given warning through which the outlaws of the Chase should slip through his fingers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="winning.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="winning.c1.s29"><qs/>"Fear not, Hubert; I can be mum when the occasion needs.</s> <s sid="30" id="winning.c1.s30">Can you tell me farther, when the bands now gathering are likely to set forth?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="winning.c1.s31"><qs/>"In brief breathing space,"<qe/> the falconer replied.</s> <s sid="32" id="winning.c1.s32"><qs/>"Those who first arrived I left swilling beer, and devouring pies and other provisions cooked for them last night, and from what I hear, they will set forth as soon as the last comer has arrived.</s> <s sid="33" id="winning.c1.s33">Whichever be their quarry, they will try to fall upon it before the news of their arrival is bruited abroad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c1.p11"><s sid="34" id="winning.c1.s34">With a wave of his hand to the falconer the boy started.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c1.s35">Leaving the road, and striking across the slightly undulated country dotted here and there by groups of trees, the lad ran at a brisk trot, without stopping to halt or breathe, until after half an hour's run he arrived at the entrance of a building, whose aspect proclaimed it to be the abode of a Saxon franklin of some importance.</s> <s sid="36" id="winning.c1.s36">It would not be called a castle, but was rather a fortified house, with a few windows looking without, and surrounded by a moat crossed by a drawbridge, and capable of sustaining anything short of a real attack.</s> <s sid="37" id="winning.c1.s37">Erstwood had but lately passed into Norman hands, and was indeed at present owned by a Saxon.</s> <s sid="38" id="winning.c1.s38">Sir William de Lance, the father of the lad who is now entering its portals, was a friend and follower of the Earl of Evesham; and soon after his lord had married Gweneth the heiress of all these fair lands--given to him by the will of the king, to whom by the death of her father she became a ward--Sir William had married Editha, the daughter and heiress of the franklin of Erstwood, a cousin and dear friend of the new Countess of Evesham.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="winning.c1.p12"><s sid="39" id="winning.c1.s39">In neither couple could the marriage at first have been called one of inclination on the part of the ladies, but love came after marriage.</s> <s sid="40" id="winning.c1.s40">Although the knights and barons of the Norman invasion would, no doubt, be considered rude and rough in these days of broadcloth and civilization, yet their manners were gentle and polished by the side of those of the rough though kindly Saxon franklins; and although the Saxon maids were doubtless as patriotic as their fathers and mothers, yet the female mind is greatly led by gentle manners and courteous address.</s> <s sid="41" id="winning.c1.s41">Thus then, when bidden or forced to give their hands to the Norman knights, they speedily accepted their lot, and for the most part grew contented and happy enough.</s> <s sid="42" id="winning.c1.s42">In their changed circumstances it was pleasanter to ride by the side of their Norman husbands, surrounded by a gay cavalcade, to hawk and to hunt, than to discharge the quiet duties of mistress of a Saxon farm-house.</s> <s sid="43" id="winning.c1.s43">In many cases, of course, their lot was rendered wretched by the violence and brutality of their lords; but in the majority they were well satisfied with their lot, and these mixed marriages did more to bring the peoples together and weld them in one, than all the laws and decrees of the Norman sovereigns.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="winning.c1.p13"><s sid="44" id="winning.c1.s44">This had certainly been the case with Editha, whose marriage with Sir William had been one of the greatest happiness.</s> <s sid="45" id="winning.c1.s45">She had lost him, three years before the story begins, fighting in Normandy, in one of the innumerable wars in which our first Norman kings were constantly involved.</s> <s sid="46" id="winning.c1.s46">On entering the gates of Erstwood, Cuthbert had rushed hastily to the room where his mother was sitting with three or four of her maidens, engaged in work.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="winning.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="winning.c1.s47"><qs/>"I want to speak to you at once, mother,"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="winning.c1.s48"><qs/>"What is it now, my son?"<qe/> said his mother, who was still young and very comely.</s> <s sid="49" id="winning.c1.s49">Waving her hand to the girls, they left her.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="winning.c1.s50"><qs/>"Mother,"<qe/><sls/> he said, when they were alone, <sle/><qs/>"I fear me that Sir Walter is about to make a great raid upon the outlaws.</s> <s sid="51" id="winning.c1.s51">Armed men have been coming in all the morning from the castles round, and if it be not against the Baron de Wortham that these preparations are intended, and methinks it is not, it must needs be against the landless men."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="winning.c1.s52"><qs/>"What would you do, Cuthbert?"<qe/> his mother asked anxiously.</s> <s sid="53" id="winning.c1.s53"><qs/>"It will not do for you to be found meddling in these matters.</s> <s sid="54" id="winning.c1.s54">At present you stand well in the favour of the Earl, who loves you for the sake of his wife, to whom you are kin, and of your father, who did him good liegeman's service."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="winning.c1.s55"><qs/>"But, mother, I have many friends in the wood.</s> <s sid="56" id="winning.c1.s56">There is Cnut, their chief, your own first cousin, and many others of our friends, all good men and true, though forced by the cruel Norman laws to refuge in the woods."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="winning.c1.s57"><qs/>"What would you do?"<qe/> again his mother asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="winning.c1.s58"><qs/>"I would take Ronald my pony and ride to warn them of the danger that threatens."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="winning.c1.s59"><qs/>"You had best go on foot, my son.</s> <s sid="60" id="winning.c1.s60">Doubtless men have been set to see that none from the Saxon homesteads carry the warning to the woods.</s> <s sid="61" id="winning.c1.s61">The distance is not beyond your reach, for you have often wandered there, and on foot you can evade the eye of the watchers; but one thing, my son, you must promise, and that is, that in no case, should the Earl and his bands meet with the outlaws, will you take part in any fray or struggle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="winning.c1.s62"><qs/>"That will I willingly, mother,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="63" id="winning.c1.s63"><qs/>"I have no cause for offence against the castle or the forest, and my blood and my kin are with both.</s> <s sid="64" id="winning.c1.s64">I would fain save shedding of blood in a quarrel like this.</s> <s sid="65" id="winning.c1.s65">I hope that the time may come when Saxon and Norman may fight side by side, and I maybe there to see."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="winning.c1.p23"><s sid="66" id="winning.c1.s66">A few minutes later, having changed his blue doublet for one of more sober and less noticeable colour, Cuthbert started for the great forest, which then stretched to within a mile of Erstwood.</s> <s sid="67" id="winning.c1.s67">In those days a large part of the country was covered with forest, and the policy of the Normans in preserving these woods for the chase, tended to prevent the increase of cultivation.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="winning.c1.p24"><s sid="68" id="winning.c1.s68">The farms and cultivated lands were all held by Saxons, who although nominally handed over to the nobles to whom William and his successors had given the fiefs, saw but little of their Norman masters.</s> <s sid="69" id="winning.c1.s69">These stood, indeed, much in the position in which landlords stand to their tenants, payment being made, for the most part, in produce.</s> <s sid="70" id="winning.c1.s70">At the edge of the wood the trees grew comparatively far apart, but as Cuthbert proceeded farther into its recesses, the trees in the virgin forest stood thick and close together.</s> <s sid="71" id="winning.c1.s71">Here and there open glades ran across each other, and in these his sharp eye, accustomed to the forest, could often see the stags starting away at the sound of his footsteps.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="winning.c1.p25"><s sid="72" id="winning.c1.s72">It was a full hour's journey before Cuthbert reached the point for which he was bound.</s> <s sid="73" id="winning.c1.s73">Here, in an open space, probably cleared by a storm ages before, and overshadowed by giant trees, was a group of men of all ages and appearances.</s> <s sid="74" id="winning.c1.s74">Some were occupied in stripping the skin off a buck which hung from the bough of one of the trees.</s> <s sid="75" id="winning.c1.s75">Others were roasting portions of the carcass of another deer.</s> <s sid="76" id="winning.c1.s76">A few sat apart, some talking, others busy in making arrows, while a few lay asleep on the greensward.</s> <s sid="77" id="winning.c1.s77">As Cuthbert entered the clearing, several of the party rose to their feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="winning.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="winning.c1.s78"><qs/>"Ah, Cuthbert,"<qe/><sls/> shouted a man of almost gigantic stature, who appeared to be one of the leaders of the party, <sle/><qs/>"what brings you here, lad, so early?</s> <s sid="79" id="winning.c1.s79">You are not wont to visit us till even, when you can lay your crossbow at a stag by moonlight."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="winning.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="winning.c1.s80"><qs/>"No, no, Cousin Cnut,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said, <sse/><qs/>"thou canst not say that I have ever broken the forest laws, though I have looked on often and often, whilst you have done so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="winning.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="winning.c1.s81"><qs/>"The abettor is as bad as the thief,"<qe/><sss/> laughed Cnut, <sse/><qs/>"and if the foresters caught us in the act, I wot they would make but little difference whether it was the shaft of my longbow or the quarrel from thy crossbow which brought down the quarry.</s> <s sid="82" id="winning.c1.s82">But again, lad, why comest thou here? for I see by the sweat on your face and by the heaving of your sides that you have run fast and far."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="winning.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="winning.c1.s83"><qs/>"I have, Cnut; I have not once stopped for breathing since I left Erstwood.</s> <s sid="84" id="winning.c1.s84">I have come to warn you of danger.</s> <s sid="85" id="winning.c1.s85">The earl is preparing for a raid."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="winning.c1.p30"><s sid="86" id="winning.c1.s86">Cnut laughed somewhat disdainfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="winning.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="winning.c1.s87"><qs/>"He has raided here before, and I trow has carried off no game.</s> <s sid="88" id="winning.c1.s88">The landless men of the forest can hold their own against a handful of Norman knights and retainers in their own home."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="winning.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="winning.c1.s89"><qs/>"Ay,"<qe/><sss/> said Cuthbert, <sse/><qs/>"but this will be no common raid.</s> <s sid="90" id="winning.c1.s90">This morning bands from all the holds within miles round are riding in, and at least 500 men-at-arms are likely to do chase today."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="winning.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="winning.c1.s91"><qs/>"Is it so?"<qe/> said Cnut, while exclamations of surprise, but not of apprehension, broke from those standing round.</s> <s sid="92" id="winning.c1.s92"><qs/>"If that be so, lad, you have done us good service indeed.</s> <s sid="93" id="winning.c1.s93">With fair warning we can slip through the fingers of ten times 500 men, but if they came upon us unawares, and hemmed us in it would fare but badly with us, though we should, I doubt not give a good account of them before their battle-axes and maces ended the strife.</s> <s sid="94" id="winning.c1.s94">Have you any idea by which road they will enter the forest, or what are their intentions?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="winning.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="winning.c1.s95"><qs/>"I know not,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said; <sse/><qs/>"all that I gathered was that the earl intended to sweep the forest, and to put an end to the breaches of the laws, not to say of the rough treatment that his foresters have met with at your hands.</s> <s sid="96" id="winning.c1.s96">You had best, methinks, be off before Sir Walter and his heavily-armed men are here.</s> <s sid="97" id="winning.c1.s97">The forest, large as it is, will scarce hold you both, and methinks you had best shift your quarters to Langholm Chase until the storm has passed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="winning.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="winning.c1.s98"><qs/>"To Langholm be it, then,"<qe/><sss/> said Cnut, <sse/><qs/>"though I love not the place.</s> <s sid="99" id="winning.c1.s99">Sir John of Wortham is a worse neighbour by far than the earl.</s> <s sid="100" id="winning.c1.s100">Against the latter we bear no malice, he is a good knight and a fair lord; and could he free himself of the Norman notions that the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and the fishes of the water, all belong to Normans, and that we Saxons have no share in them, I should have no quarrel with him.</s> <s sid="101" id="winning.c1.s101">He grinds not his neighbours, he is content with a fair tithe of the produce, and as between man and man is a fair judge without favour.</s> <s sid="102" id="winning.c1.s102">The baron is a fiend incarnate; did he not fear that he would lose by so doing, he would gladly cut the throats, or burn, or drown, or hang every Saxon within twenty miles of his hold.</s> <s sid="103" id="winning.c1.s103">He is a disgrace to his order, and some day when our band gathers a little stronger, we will burn his nest about his ears."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="winning.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="winning.c1.s104"><qs/>"It will be a hard nut to crack,"<qe/> Cuthbert said, laughing.</s> <s sid="105" id="winning.c1.s105"><qs/>"With such arms as you have in the forest the enterprise would be something akin to scaling the skies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="winning.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="winning.c1.s106"><qs/>"Ladders and axes will go far, lad, and the Norman men-at-arms have learned to dread our shafts.</s> <s sid="107" id="winning.c1.s107">But enough of the baron; if we must be his neighbours for a time, so be it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="winning.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="winning.c1.s108"><qs/>"You have heard, my mates,"<qe/><sls/> he said, turning to his comrades gathered around him, <sle/><qs/>"what Cuthbert tells us.</s> <s sid="109" id="winning.c1.s109">Are you of my opinion, that it is better to move away till the storm is past, than to fight against heavy odds, without much chance of either booty or victory?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="winning.c1.p39"><s sid="110" id="winning.c1.s110">A general chorus proclaimed that the outlaws approved of the proposal for a move to Langholm Chase.</s> <s sid="111" id="winning.c1.s111">The preparations were simple.</s> <s sid="112" id="winning.c1.s112">Bows were taken down from the boughs on which they were hanging, quivers slung across the backs, short cloaks thrown over the shoulders.</s> <s sid="113" id="winning.c1.s113">The deer was hurriedly dismembered, and the joints fastened to a pole slung on the shoulders of two of the men.</s> <s sid="114" id="winning.c1.s114">The drinking-cups, some of which were of silver, looking strangely out of place among the rough horn implements and platters, were bundled together, carried a short distance and dropped among some thick bushes for safety; and then the band started for Wortham.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="winning.c1.p40"><s sid="115" id="winning.c1.s115">With a cordial farewell and many thanks to Cuthbert, who declined their invitations to accompany them, the retreat to Langholm commenced.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="winning.c1.p41"><s sid="116" id="winning.c1.s116">Cuthbert, not knowing in which direction the bands were likely to approach, remained for a while motionless, intently listening.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="winning.c1.p42"><s sid="117" id="winning.c1.s117">In a quarter of an hour he heard the distant note of a bugle.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="winning.c1.p43"><s sid="118" id="winning.c1.s118">It was answered in three different directions, and Cuthbert, who knew every path and glade of the forest, was able pretty accurately to surmise those by which the various bands were commencing to enter the wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="winning.c1.p44"><s sid="119" id="winning.c1.s119">Knowing that they were still a long way off, he advanced as rapidly as he could in the direction in which they were coming.</s> <s sid="120" id="winning.c1.s120">When by the sound of distant voices and the breaking of branches he knew that one at least of the parties was near at hand, he rapidly climbed a thick tree and ensconced himself in the branches, and there watched, secure and hidden from the sharpest eye, the passage of a body of men-at-arms fully a hundred strong, led by Sir Walter himself, accompanied by some half dozen of his knights.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="winning.c1.p45"><s sid="121" id="winning.c1.s121">When they had passed, Cuthbert again slipped down the tree and made at all speed for home.</s> <s sid="122" id="winning.c1.s122">He reached it, so far as he knew without having been observed by a single passer-by.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="winning.c1.p46"><s sid="123" id="winning.c1.s123">After a brief talk with his mother, he started for the castle, as his appearance there would divert any suspicion that might arise; and it would also appear natural that seeing the movements of so large a body of men, he should go up to gossip with his acquaintances there.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="winning.c1.p47"><s sid="124" id="winning.c1.s124">When distant a mile from Evesham, he came upon a small party.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="winning.c1.p48"><s sid="125" id="winning.c1.s125">On a white palfrey rode Margaret, the little daughter of the earl.</s> <s sid="126" id="winning.c1.s126">She was accompanied by her nurse and two retainers on foot.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="winning.c1.p49"><s sid="127" id="winning.c1.s127">Cuthbert--who was a great favourite with the earl's daughter, for whom he frequently brought pets, such as nests of young owlets, falcons, and other creatures--was about to join the party when from a clump of trees near burst a body of ten mounted men.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="winning.c1.p50"><s sid="128" id="winning.c1.s128">Without a word they rode straight at the astonished group.</s> <s sid="129" id="winning.c1.s129">The retainers were cut to the ground before they had thought of drawing a sword in defence.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="winning.c1.p51"><s sid="130" id="winning.c1.s130">The nurse was slain by a blow with a battle-axe, and Margaret, snatched from her palfrey, was thrown across the saddle-bow of one of the mounted men, who then with his comrades dashed off at full speed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="winning.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="winning.c2.s1">The whole of the startling scene of the abduction of the Earl of Evesham's daughter occupied but a few seconds.</s> <s sid="2" id="winning.c2.s2">Cuthbert was so astounded at the sudden calamity that he remained rooted to the ground at the spot where, fortunately for himself, unnoticed by the assailants, he had stood when they first burst from their concealment.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="winning.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="winning.c2.s3">For a short time he hesitated as to the course he should take.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="winning.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="winning.c2.s4">The men-at-arms who remained in the castle were scarce strong enough to rescue the child, whose captors would no doubt be reinforced by a far stronger party lurking near.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="winning.c2.p4"><s sid="5" id="winning.c2.s5">The main body of Sir Walter's followers were deep in the recesses of the forest, and this lay altogether out of the line for Wortham, and there would be no chance whatever of bringing them up in time to cut off the marauders on their way back.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="winning.c2.p5"><s sid="6" id="winning.c2.s6">There remained only the outlaws, who by this time would be in Langholm Forest, perhaps within a mile or two of the castle itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="winning.c2.p6"><s sid="7" id="winning.c2.s7">The road by which the horsemen would travel would be far longer than the direct line across country, and he resolved at once to strain every nerve to reach his friends in time to get them to interpose between the captors of the Lady Margaret and their stronghold.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c2.p7"><s sid="8" id="winning.c2.s8">For an instant he hesitated whether to run back to Erstwood to get a horse; but he decided that it would be as quick to go on foot, and far easier so to find the outlaws.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="winning.c2.p8"><s sid="9" id="winning.c2.s9">These thoughts occupied but a few moments, and he at once started at the top of his speed for his long run across the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="winning.c2.p9"><s sid="10" id="winning.c2.s10">Had Cuthbert been running in a race of hare and hound, he would assuredly have borne away the prize from most boys of his age.</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c2.s11">At headlong pace he made across the country, every foot of which, as far as the edge of Langholm Chase, he knew by heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c2.p10"><s sid="12" id="winning.c2.s12">The distance to the woods was some twelve miles, and in an hour and a half from the moment of his starting Cuthbert was deep within its shades.</s> <s sid="13" id="winning.c2.s13">Where he would be likely to find the outlaws he knew not; and, putting a whistle to his lips, he shrilly blew the signal, which would, he knew, be recognized by any of the band within hearing.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c2.p11"><s sid="14" id="winning.c2.s14">He thought that he heard an answer, but was not certain, and again dashed forward, almost as speedily as if he had but just started.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="winning.c2.p12"><s sid="15" id="winning.c2.s15">Five minutes later a man stood in the glade up which he was running.</s> <s sid="16" id="winning.c2.s16">He recognized him at once as one of Cnut's party.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="winning.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="winning.c2.s17"><qs/>"Where are the band?"<qe/> he gasped.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="winning.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="winning.c2.s18"><qs/>"Half a mile or so to the right,"<qe/> replied the man.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c2.p15"><s sid="19" id="winning.c2.s19">Guided by the man, Cuthbert ran at full speed, till, panting and scarce able to speak, he arrived at the spot where Cnut's band were gathered.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c2.p16"><s sid="20" id="winning.c2.s20">In a few words he told them what had happened, and although they had just been chased by the father of the captured child, there was not a moment of hesitation in promising their aid to rescue her from a man whom they regarded as a far more bitter enemy, both of themselves and their race.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="winning.c2.s21"><qs/>"I fear we shall be too late to cut them off,"<qe/><sss/> Cnut said, <sse/><qs/>"they have so long a start; but at least we will waste no time in gossiping."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c2.p18"><s sid="22" id="winning.c2.s22">Winding a horn to call together some of the members of the band who had scattered, and leaving one at the meeting-place to give instructions to the rest, Cnut, followed by those assembled there, went off at a swinging trot through the glades towards Wortham Castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c2.p19"><s sid="23" id="winning.c2.s23">After a rapid calculation of distances, and allowing for the fact that the baron's men--knowing that Sir Walter's retainers and friends were all deep in the forest, and even if they heard of the outrage could not be on their traces for hours--would take matters quietly, Cnut concluded that they had arrived in time.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c2.p20"><s sid="24" id="winning.c2.s24">Turning off, they made their way along the edge of the wood to the point where the road from Evesham ran through the forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c2.p21"><s sid="25" id="winning.c2.s25">Scarcely had the party reached this point when they heard a faint clatter of steel.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="winning.c2.s26"><qs/>"Here they come!"<qe/> exclaimed Cuthbert.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="winning.c2.p23"><s sid="27" id="winning.c2.s27">Cnut gave rapid directions, and the band took up their posts behind the trees, on either side of the path.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="winning.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="winning.c2.s28"><qs/>"Remember,"<qe/><sss/> Cnut said, <sse/><qs/>"above all things be careful not to hit the child, but pierce the horse on which she is riding.</s> <s sid="29" id="winning.c2.s29">The instant he falls, rush forward.</s> <s sid="30" id="winning.c2.s30">We must trust to surprise to give us the victory."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="winning.c2.p25"><s sid="31" id="winning.c2.s31">Three minutes later the head of a band of horsemen was seen through the trees.</s> <s sid="32" id="winning.c2.s32">They were some thirty in number, and, closely grouped as they were together, the watchers behind the trees could not see the form of the child carried in their midst.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="winning.c2.p26"><s sid="33" id="winning.c2.s33">When they came abreast of the concealed outlaws, Cnut gave a sharp whistle, and fifty arrows flew from tree and bush into the closely gathered party of horsemen.</s> <s sid="34" id="winning.c2.s34">More than half their number fell at once; some, drawing their swords, endeavoured to rush at their concealed foes, while others dashed forward in the hope of riding through the snare into which they had fallen.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c2.s35">Cuthbert had levelled his crossbow, but had not fired; he was watching with intense anxiety for a glimpse of the bright-coloured dress of the child.</s> <s sid="36" id="winning.c2.s36">Soon he saw a horseman separate himself from the rest and dash forward at full speed.</s> <s sid="37" id="winning.c2.s37">Several arrows flew by him, and one or two struck the horse on which he rode.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="winning.c2.p27"><s sid="38" id="winning.c2.s38">The animal, however, kept on its way.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="winning.c2.p28"><s sid="39" id="winning.c2.s39">Cuthbert levelled his crossbow on the low arm of a tree, and as the rider came abreast of him touched the trigger, and the steel-pointed quarrel flew true and strong against the temple of the passing horseman.</s> <s sid="40" id="winning.c2.s40">He fell from his horse like a stone and the well-trained animal at once stood still by the side of his rider.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="winning.c2.p29"><s sid="41" id="winning.c2.s41">Cuthbert leapt forward, and to his delight the child at once opened her arms and cried in a joyous tone,--</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="winning.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="winning.c2.s42"><qs/>"Cuthbert!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="winning.c2.p31"><s sid="43" id="winning.c2.s43">The fight was still raging fiercely, and Cuthbert, raising her from the ground, ran with her into the wood, where they remained hidden until the combat ceased, and the last survivors of the Baron's band had ridden past towards the castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="winning.c2.p32"><s sid="44" id="winning.c2.s44">Then Cuthbert went forward with his charge and joined the band of outlaws, who, absorbed in the fight, had not witnessed the incident of her rescue, and now received them with loud shouts of joy and triumph.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="winning.c2.p33" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="winning.c2.s45"><qs/>"This is a good day's work indeed for all,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said; <sse/><qs/>"it will make of the earl a firm friend instead of a bitter enemy; and I doubt not that better days are dawning for Evesham Forest."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="winning.c2.p34"><s sid="46" id="winning.c2.s46">A litter was speedily made with boughs, on this Margaret was placed, and on the shoulders of two stout foresters started for home, Cnut and Cuthbert walking beside, and a few of the band keeping at a short distance behind, as a sort of rear-guard should the Baron attempt to regain his prey.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="winning.c2.p35"><s sid="47" id="winning.c2.s47">There was now no cause for speed, and Cuthbert in truth could scarce drag one foot before another, for he had already traversed over twenty miles, the greater portion of the distance at his highest rate of speed.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="winning.c2.p36"><s sid="48" id="winning.c2.s48">Cnut offered to have a litter made for him also, but this Cuthbert indignantly refused; however, in the forest they came upon the hut of a small cultivator, who had a rough forest pony, which was borrowed for Cuthbert's use.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="winning.c2.p37"><s sid="49" id="winning.c2.s49">It was late in the afternoon before they came in sight of Evesham Castle.</s> <s sid="50" id="winning.c2.s50">From the distance could be seen bodies of armed men galloping towards it, and it was clear that only now the party were returning from the wood, and had learned the news of the disappearance of the Earl's daughter, and of the finding of the bodies of her attendants.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="winning.c2.p38"><s sid="51" id="winning.c2.s51">Presently they met one of the mounted retainers riding at headlong speed.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="winning.c2.p39" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="winning.c2.s52"><qs/>"Have you heard or seen anything,"<qe/><sls/> he shouted, as he approached, <sle/><qs/>"of the Lady Margaret?</s> <s sid="53" id="winning.c2.s53">She is missing, and foul play has taken place."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="winning.c2.p40" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="winning.c2.s54"><qs/>"Here I am, Rudolph,"<qe/> cried the child, sitting up on the rude litter.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="winning.c2.p41"><s sid="55" id="winning.c2.s55">The horseman gave a cry of astonishment and pleasure, and without a word wheeled his horse and galloped past back at headlong speed towards the castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="winning.c2.p42"><s sid="56" id="winning.c2.s56">As Cuthbert and the party approached the gate, the earl himself, surrounded by his knights and followers, rode out hastily from the gate and halted in front of the little party.</s> <s sid="57" id="winning.c2.s57">The litter was lowered, and as he dismounted from his horse his daughter sprang out and leapt into his arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="winning.c2.p43"><s sid="58" id="winning.c2.s58">For a few minutes the confusion and babble of tongues were too great for anything to be heard, but Cuthbert, as soon as order was somewhat restored, stated what had happened, and the earl was moved to fury at the news of the outrage which had been perpetrated by the Baron of Wortham upon his daughter and at the very gates of his castle, and also at the thought that she should have been saved by the bravery and devotion of the very men against whom he had so lately been vowing vengeance in the depths of the forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="winning.c2.p44" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="winning.c2.s59"><qs/>"This is not a time,"<qe/><sss/> he said to Cnut, <sse/><qs/>"for talking or making promises, but be assured that henceforth the deer of Evesham Chase are as free to you and your men as to me.</s> <s sid="60" id="winning.c2.s60">Forest laws or no forest laws, I will no more lift a hand against men to whom I owe so much.</s> <s sid="61" id="winning.c2.s61">Come when you will to the castle, my friends, and let us talk over what can be done to erase your outlawry and restore you to an honest career again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="winning.c2.p45"><s sid="62" id="winning.c2.s62">Cuthbert returned home tired, but delighted with his day's work, and Dame Editha was surprised indeed with the tale of adventure he had to tell.</s> <s sid="63" id="winning.c2.s63">The next morning he went over to the castle, and heard that a grand council had been held the evening before, and that it had been determined to attack Wortham Castle and to raze it to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="winning.c2.p46"><s sid="64" id="winning.c2.s64">Immediately on hearing of his arrival, the earl, after again expressing his gratitude for the rescue of his daughter, asked him if he would go into the forest and invite the outlaws to join their forces with those of the castle to attack the baron.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="winning.c2.p47"><s sid="65" id="winning.c2.s65">Cuthbert willingly undertook the mission, as he felt that this alliance would further strengthen the position of the forest men.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="winning.c2.p48"><s sid="66" id="winning.c2.s66">When he arrived there was some considerable consultation and discussion between the outlaws as to the expediency of mixing themselves in the quarrels between the Norman barons.</s> <s sid="67" id="winning.c2.s67">However, Cnut persuaded them that as the Baron of Wortham was an enemy and oppressor of all Saxons, it was in fact their own quarrel that they were fighting rather than that of the earl, and they therefore agreed to give their aid, and promised to be at the rendezvous outside the castle to be attacked, soon after dawn next morning.</s> <s sid="68" id="winning.c2.s68">Cuthbert returned with the news, which gave great satisfaction to the earl.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="winning.c2.p49"><s sid="69" id="winning.c2.s69">The castle was now a scene of bustle and business; armourers were at work repairing head-pieces and breastplates, sharpening swords and battle-axes, while the fletchers prepared sheaves of arrows.</s> <s sid="70" id="winning.c2.s70">In the courtyard a number of men were engaged oiling the catapults, ballistas, and other machines for hurling stones.</s> <s sid="71" id="winning.c2.s71">All were discussing the chances of the assault, for it was no easy matter which they had set themselves to do.</s> <s sid="72" id="winning.c2.s72">Wortham Hold was an extremely strong one, and it needed all and more than all the machines at their disposal to undertake so formidable an operation as a siege.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="winning.c2.p50"><s sid="73" id="winning.c2.s73">The garrison, too, were strong and desperate; and the baron, knowing what must follow his outrage of the day before, would have been sure to send off messengers round the country begging his friends to come to his assistance.</s> <s sid="74" id="winning.c2.s74">Cuthbert had begged permission of his mother to ask the earl to allow him to join as a volunteer, but she would not hear of it.</s> <s sid="75" id="winning.c2.s75">Neither would she suffer him to mingle with the foresters.</s> <s sid="76" id="winning.c2.s76">The utmost that he could obtain was that he might go as a spectator, with strict injunctions to keep himself out of the fray, and as far as possible beyond bow-shot of the castle wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="winning.c2.p51"><s sid="77" id="winning.c2.s77">It was a force of some 400 strong that issued from the wood early next morning to attack the stronghold at Wortham.</s> <s sid="78" id="winning.c2.s78">The force consisted of some ten or twelve knights and barons, some 150 or 160 Norman men-at-arms, a miscellaneous gathering of other retainers, 200 strong, and some eighty of the forest men.</s> <s sid="79" id="winning.c2.s79">These last were not to fight under the earl's banner, but were to act on their own account.</s> <s sid="80" id="winning.c2.s80">There were among them outlaws, escaped serfs, and some men guilty of bloodshed.</s> <s sid="81" id="winning.c2.s81">The earl then could not have suffered these men to fight under his flag until purged in some way of their offences.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="winning.c2.p52"><s sid="82" id="winning.c2.s82">This arrangement suited the foresters well.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="winning.c2.p53"><s sid="83" id="winning.c2.s83">Their strong point was shooting; and by taking up their own position, and following their own tactics, under the leadership of Cnut, they would be able to do far more execution, and that with less risk to themselves, than if compelled to fight according to the fashion of the Normans.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="winning.c2.p54"><s sid="84" id="winning.c2.s84">As they approached the castle a trumpet was blown, and the herald, advancing, demanded its surrender, stigmatized the Baron of Wortham as a false knight and a disgrace to his class, and warned all those within the castle to abstain from giving him aid or countenance, but to submit themselves to the earl, Sir Walter of Evesham, the representative of King Richard.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="winning.c2.p55"><s sid="85" id="winning.c2.s85">The reply to the summons was a burst of taunting laughter from the walls; and scarcely had the herald withdrawn, than a flight of arrows showed that the besieged were perfectly ready for the fray.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="winning.c2.p56"><s sid="86" id="winning.c2.s86">Indeed, the baron had not been idle.</s> <s sid="87" id="winning.c2.s87">Already the dispute between himself and the earl had come to such a point that it was certain that sooner or later open hostilities would break out.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="winning.c2.p57"><s sid="88" id="winning.c2.s88">He had therefore been for some time quietly accumulating a large store of provisions and munitions of war, and strengthening the castle in every way.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="winning.c2.p58"><s sid="89" id="winning.c2.s89">The moat had been cleaned out, and filled to the brim with water.</s> <s sid="90" id="winning.c2.s90">Great quantities of heavy stones had been accumulated on the most exposed points of the walls, in readiness to hurl upon any who might try to climb.</s> <s sid="91" id="winning.c2.s91">Huge sheaves of arrows and piles of crossbow bolts, were in readiness, and in all, save the number of men, Wortham had for weeks been prepared for the siege.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="winning.c2.p59"><s sid="92" id="winning.c2.s92">On the day when the attempt to carry off the earl's daughter had failed, the baron, seeing that his bold stroke to obtain a hostage which would have enabled him to make his own terms with the earl, had been thwarted, knew that the struggle was inevitable.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="winning.c2.p60"><s sid="93" id="winning.c2.s93">Fleet messengers had been sent in all directions.</s> <s sid="94" id="winning.c2.s94">To Gloucester and Hereford, Stafford, and even Oxford, men had ridden, with letters to the baron's friends, beseeching them to march to his assistance.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="winning.c2.p61" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="winning.c2.s95"><qs/>"I can,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"defend my hold for weeks.</s> <s sid="96" id="winning.c2.s96">But it is only by aid from without that I can finally hope to break the power of this braggart earl."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="winning.c2.p62"><s sid="97" id="winning.c2.s97">Many of those to whom he addressed his call had speedily complied with his demand, while those at a distance might be expected to reply later to the appeal.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="winning.c2.p63"><s sid="98" id="winning.c2.s98">There were many among the barons who considered the mildness of the Earl of Evesham towards the Saxons in his district to be a mistake, and who, although not actually approving of the tyranny and brutality of the Baron of Wortham, yet looked upon his cause to some extent as their own.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="winning.c2.p64"><s sid="99" id="winning.c2.s99">The Castle of Wortham stood upon ground but very slightly elevated above the surrounding country.</s> <s sid="100" id="winning.c2.s100">A deep and wide moat ran round it, and this could, by diverting a rivulet, be filled at will.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="winning.c2.p65"><s sid="101" id="winning.c2.s101">From the edge of the moat the walls rose high, and with strong flanking towers and battlements.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="winning.c2.p66"><s sid="102" id="winning.c2.s102">There were strong works also beyond the moat opposite to the drawbridge; while in the centre of the castle rose the keep, from whose summit the archers, and the machines for casting stones and darts, could command the whole circuit of defence.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="winning.c2.p67"><s sid="103" id="winning.c2.s103">As Cuthbert, accompanied by one of the hinds of the farm, took his post high up in a lofty tree, where at his ease he could command a view of the proceedings, he marvelled much in what manner an attack upon so fair a fortress would be commenced.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="winning.c2.p68" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="winning.c2.s104"><qs/>"It will be straightforward work to attack the outwork,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"but that once won, I see not how we are to proceed against the castle itself.</s> <s sid="105" id="winning.c2.s105">The machines that the earl has will scarcely hurl stones strong enough even to knock the mortar from the walls.</s> <s sid="106" id="winning.c2.s106">Ladders are useless where they cannot be planted; and if the garrison are as brave as the castle is strong, methinks that the earl has embarked upon a business that will keep him here till next spring."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="winning.c2.p69"><s sid="107" id="winning.c2.s107">There was little time lost in commencing the conflict.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="winning.c2.p70"><s sid="108" id="winning.c2.s108">The foresters, skirmishing up near to the castle, and taking advantage of every inequality in the ground, of every bush and tuft of high grass, worked up close to the moat, and then opened a heavy fire with their bows against the men-at-arms on the battlements, and prevented their using the machines against the main force now advancing to the attack upon the outwork.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="winning.c2.p71"><s sid="109" id="winning.c2.s109">This was stoutly defended.</s> <s sid="110" id="winning.c2.s110">But the impetuosity of the earl, backed as it was by the gallantry of the knights serving under him, carried all obstacles.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="winning.c2.p72"><s sid="111" id="winning.c2.s111">The narrow moat which encircled this work was speedily filled with great bundles of brushwood, which had been prepared the previous night.</s> <s sid="112" id="winning.c2.s112">Across these the assailants rushed.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="winning.c2.p73"><s sid="113" id="winning.c2.s113">Some thundered at the gate with their battle-axes, while others placed ladders by which, although several times hurled backwards by the defenders, they finally succeeded in getting a footing on the wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="winning.c2.p74"><s sid="114" id="winning.c2.s114">Once there, the combat was virtually over.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="winning.c2.p75"><s sid="115" id="winning.c2.s115">The defenders were either cut down or taken prisoners, and in two hours after the assault began, the outwork of Wortham Castle was taken.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="winning.c2.p76"><s sid="116" id="winning.c2.s116">This, however, was but the commencement of the undertaking, and it had cost more than twenty lives to the assailants.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="winning.c2.p77"><s sid="117" id="winning.c2.s117">They were now, indeed, little nearer to capturing the castle than they had been before.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="winning.c2.p78"><s sid="118" id="winning.c2.s118">The moat was wide and deep.</s> <s sid="119" id="winning.c2.s119">The drawbridge had been lifted at the instant that the first of the assailants gained a footing upon the wall.</s> <s sid="120" id="winning.c2.s120">And now that the outwork was captured, a storm of arrows, stones, and other missiles was poured into it from the castle walls, and rendered it impossible for any of its new masters, to show themselves above it.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="winning.c2.p79"><s sid="121" id="winning.c2.s121">Seeing that any sudden attack was impossible, the earl now directed a strong body to cut down trees, and prepare a movable bridge to throw across the moat.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="winning.c2.p80"><s sid="122" id="winning.c2.s122">This would be a work of fully two days; and in the meantime Cuthbert returned to the farm.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="winning.c3.p4" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="winning.c3.s5"><qs/>"And how was that, prithee?"<qe/> asked Cuthbert.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c3.p7" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="winning.c3.s8"><qs/>"We were but Saxon swine,"<qe/><sss/> said Gurth bitterly, <sse/><qs/>"and a few of us more or less mattered not.</s> <s sid="9" id="winning.c3.s9">We were then serfs of the baron.</s> <s sid="10" id="winning.c3.s10">But my mother fled with me on the news of my father's death.</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c3.s11">For years we remained far away, with some friends in a forest near Oxford.</s> <s sid="12" id="winning.c3.s12">Then she pined for her native air, and came back and entered the service of the franklin."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="winning.c3.p9" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="winning.c3.s15"><qs/>"She always believed, Master Cuthbert, that my father was killed by the baron, to prevent him giving any news of the secrets of the castle.</s> <s sid="16" id="winning.c3.s16">He and some others had been kept in the walls for many months, and were engaged in the making of secret passages."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="winning.c3.s17"><qs/>"That is just what I came to ask you, Gurth.</s> <s sid="18" id="winning.c3.s18">I have heard something of this story before, and now that we are attacking Wortham Castle, and the earl has sworn to level it to the ground, it is of importance if possible to find out whether any of the secret passages lead beyond the castle, and if so, where.</s> <s sid="19" id="winning.c3.s19">Almost all the castles have, I have been told, an exit by which the garrison can at will make sorties or escape; and I thought that maybe you might have heard enough to give us some clue as to the existence of such a passage at Wortham."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c3.p11"><s sid="20" id="winning.c3.s20">The old man thought for some time in silence, and then said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c3.p15" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="winning.c3.s29"><qs/>"Why did you not go in at once according to your intention?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c3.p16" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="winning.c3.s30"><qs/>"Because my mother said that she thought some important work was on hand, and that maybe the baron would not like that women should know aught of it, for he was of suspicious and evil mind.</s> <s sid="31" id="winning.c3.s31">More than this I know not.</s> <s sid="32" id="winning.c3.s32">The castle had already been finished, and most of the masons discharged.</s> <s sid="33" id="winning.c3.s33">There were, however, a party of serfs kept at work, and also some masons, and rumour had it that they were engaged in making the secret passages.</s> <s sid="34" id="winning.c3.s34">Whether it was so or not I cannot say, but I know that none of that party ever left the castle alive.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c3.s35">It was given out that a bad fever had raged there, but none believed it; and the report went about, and was I doubt not true, that all had been killed, to preserve the secret of the passage."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c3.p17"><s sid="36" id="winning.c3.s36">Cuthbert lost no time in making use of the information that he had gained.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c3.p18"><s sid="37" id="winning.c3.s37">Early next morning, at daybreak, he started on his pony to Wortham.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c3.p19"><s sid="38" id="winning.c3.s38">As he did not wish the earl or his followers to know the facts that he had learned until they were proved, he made his way round the camp of the besiegers, and by means of his whistle called one of the foresters to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c3.p20" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="winning.c3.s39"><qs/>"Where is Cnut?"<qe/> he asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c3.p21" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="winning.c3.s40"><qs/>"He is with a party occupied in making ladders."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c3.p22" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="winning.c3.s41"><qs/>"Go to him,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said, <sse/><qs/>"and tell him to withdraw quietly and make his way here.</s> <s sid="42" id="winning.c3.s42">I have an important matter on which I wish to speak to him,'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="winning.c3.p23"><s sid="43" id="winning.c3.s43">Cnut arrived in a few minutes, somewhat wondering at the message.</s> <s sid="44" id="winning.c3.s44">He brightened greatly when Cuthbert told him what he had learned.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="winning.c3.p24" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="winning.c3.s45"><qs/>"This is indeed important,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="46" id="winning.c3.s46"><qs/>"We will lose no time in searching the copse you speak of.</s> <s sid="47" id="winning.c3.s47">You and I, together with two of my most trusty men, with axes to clear away the brush, will do.</s> <s sid="48" id="winning.c3.s48">At present a thing of this sort had best be kept between as few as may be."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="winning.c3.p25"><s sid="49" id="winning.c3.s49">They started at once and soon came down upon the stream.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="winning.c3.p26"><s sid="50" id="winning.c3.s50">It ran at this point in a little valley, some twenty or thirty feet deep.</s> <s sid="51" id="winning.c3.s51">On the bank not far from the castle grew a small wood, and it was in this that Cuthbert hoped to find the passage spoken of by Gurth.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="winning.c3.p27"><s sid="52" id="winning.c3.s52">The trees and brushwood were so thick that it was apparent at once that if the passage had ever existed it had been unused for some years.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="winning.c3.p28"><s sid="53" id="winning.c3.s53">The woodmen were obliged to chop down dozens of young saplings to make their way up from the water towards the steeper part of the bank.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="winning.c3.p29"><s sid="54" id="winning.c3.s54">The wood was some fifty yards in length, and as it was uncertain at which point the passage had come out, a very minute search had to be made.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="winning.c3.p30" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="winning.c3.s55"><qs/>"What do you think it would be like, Cnut?"<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="winning.c3.s56">Cuthbert asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="winning.c3.p31" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="winning.c3.s57"><qs/>"Like enough to a rabbit-hole, or more likely still there would be no hole whatever.</s> <s sid="58" id="winning.c3.s58">We must look for moss and greenery, for it is likely that such would have been planted, so as to conceal the door from any passer-by, while yet allowing a party from inside to cut their way through it without difficulty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="winning.c3.p32"><s sid="59" id="winning.c3.s59">After a search of two hours, Cnut decided that the only place in the copse in which it was likely that the entrance to a passage could be hidden, was a spot where the ground was covered thickly with ivy and trailing plants.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="winning.c3.p33" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="winning.c3.s60"><qs/>"It looks level enough with the rest,"<qe/> Cuthbert said.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="winning.c3.p34" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="winning.c3.s61"><qs/>"Ay, lad, but we know not what lies behind this thick screen of ivy.</s> <s sid="62" id="winning.c3.s62">Thrust in that staff."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="winning.c3.p35"><s sid="63" id="winning.c3.s63">One of the woodmen began to probe with the end of a staff among the ivy.</s> <s sid="64" id="winning.c3.s64">For some time he was met by the solid ground, but presently the butt of the staff went through suddenly, pitching him on his head, amidst a suppressed laugh from his comrades.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="winning.c3.p36" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="winning.c3.s65"><qs/>"Here it is, if anywhere,"<qe/> said Cnut, and with their billhooks they at once began to clear away the thickly grown creepers.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="winning.c3.p37"><s sid="66" id="winning.c3.s66">Five minutes' work was sufficient to show a narrow cut, some two feet wide, in the hill side, at the end of which stood a low door.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="winning.c3.p38" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="winning.c3.s67"><qs/>"Here it is,"<qe/><sss/> said Cnut, with triumph, <sse/><qs/>"and the castle is ours.</s> <s sid="68" id="winning.c3.s68">Thanks, Cuthbert, for your thought and intelligence.</s> <s sid="69" id="winning.c3.s69">It has not been used lately, that is clear,"<qe/> he went on.</s> <s sid="70" id="winning.c3.s70"><qs/>"These creepers have not been moved for years.</s> <s sid="71" id="winning.c3.s71">Shall we go and tell the earl of our discovery?</s> <s sid="72" id="winning.c3.s72">What think you, Cuthbert?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="winning.c3.p39" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="winning.c3.s73"><qs/>"I think we had better not,"<qe/> Cuthbert said.</s> <s sid="74" id="winning.c3.s74"><qs/>"We might not succeed in getting in, as the passage may have fallen farther along; but I will speak to him and tell him that we have something on hand which may alter his dispositions for fighting to-morrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="winning.c3.p40"><s sid="75" id="winning.c3.s75">Cuthbert made his way to the earl, who had taken possession of a small cottage a short distance from the castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="winning.c3.p42" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="winning.c3.s78"><qs/>"I want to ask you, sir, not to attack the castle to-morrow until you see a white flag waved from the keep."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="winning.c3.p43" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="winning.c3.s79"><qs/>"But how on earth is a white flag to be raised from the keep?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="winning.c3.p44" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="winning.c3.s80"><qs/>"It may be,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said, <sse/><qs/>"that I have some friends inside who will be able to make a diversion in our favour.</s> <s sid="81" id="winning.c3.s81">However sir, it can do no harm if you will wait till then, and may save many lives.</s> <s sid="82" id="winning.c3.s82">At what hour do you mean to attack?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="winning.c3.p45" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="winning.c3.s83"><qs/>"The bridges and all other preparations to assist us across the moat will be ready to-night.</s> <s sid="84" id="winning.c3.s84">We will advance then under cover of darkness, and as soon after dawn as may be attack in earnest."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="winning.c3.p46" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="winning.c3.s85"><qs/>"Very well, sir,"<qe/> Cuthbert said.</s> <s sid="86" id="winning.c3.s86"><qs/>"I trust that within five minutes after your bugle has sounded, the white flag will make its appearance on the keep, but it cannot do so until after you have commenced an attack, or at least a pretence of an attack."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="winning.c3.p47"><s sid="87" id="winning.c3.s87">Two or three hours before daylight Cuthbert accompanied Cnut and twenty-five picked men of the foresters to the copse.</s> <s sid="88" id="winning.c3.s88">They were provided with crowbars, and all carried heavy axes.</s> <s sid="89" id="winning.c3.s89">The door was soon prised open.</s> <s sid="90" id="winning.c3.s90">It opened silently and without a creak.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="winning.c3.p48" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="winning.c3.s91"><qs/>"It may be,"<qe/><sss/> Cnut said, <sse/><qs/>"that the door has not been opened as you say for years, but it is certain,"<qe/><sls/> and he placed his torch to the hinges, <sle/><qs/>"that it has been well oiled within the last two or three days.</s> <s sid="92" id="winning.c3.s92">No doubt the baron intended to make his escape this way, should the worst arrive.</s> <s sid="93" id="winning.c3.s93">Now that we have the door open we had better wait quiet until the dawn commences.</s> <s sid="94" id="winning.c3.s94">The earl will blow his bugle as a signal for the advance; it will be another ten minutes before they are fairly engaged, and that will be enough for us to break open any doors that there may be between this and the castle, and to force our way inside."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="winning.c3.p49"><s sid="95" id="winning.c3.s95">It seemed a long time waiting before the dawn fairly broke--still longer before the earl's bugle was heard to sound the attack.</s> <s sid="96" id="winning.c3.s96">Then the band, headed by Cnut and two or three of the strongest of the party, entered the passage.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="winning.c3.p50"><s sid="97" id="winning.c3.s97">Cuthbert had had some misgivings as to his mother's injunctions to take no part in the fray, and it cannot be said that in accompanying the foresters he obeyed the letter of her instructions.</s> <s sid="98" id="winning.c3.s98">At the same time as he felt sure that the effect of a surprise would be complete and crushing, and that the party would gain the top of the keep without any serious resistance, he considered the risk was so small as to justify him in accompanying the foresters.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="winning.c3.p51"><s sid="99" id="winning.c3.s99">The passage was some five feet high, and little more than two feet wide.</s> <s sid="100" id="winning.c3.s100">It was dry and dusty, and save the marks on the ground of a human foot going and returning, doubtless that of the man who had oiled the lock the day before, the passage appeared to have been unused from the time that it left the hands of its builders.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="winning.c3.p52"><s sid="101" id="winning.c3.s101">Passing along for some distance they came to another strong oaken door.</s> <s sid="102" id="winning.c3.s102">This, like the last, yielded to the efforts of the crowbars of the foresters, and they again advanced.</s> <s sid="103" id="winning.c3.s103">Presently they came to a flight of steps.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="winning.c3.p53" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="winning.c3.s104"><qs/>"We must now be near the castle,"<qe/> Cnut said.</s> <s sid="105" id="winning.c3.s105"><qs/>"In fact, methinks I can hear confused noises ahead."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="winning.c3.p54"><s sid="106" id="winning.c3.s106">Mounting the steps, they came to a third door; this was thickly studded with iron, and appeared of very great strength.</s> <s sid="107" id="winning.c3.s107">Fortunately the lock was upon their side, and they were enabled to shoot the bolt; but upon the other side the door was firmly secured by large bolts, and it was fully five minutes before the foresters could succeed in opening it.</s> <s sid="108" id="winning.c3.s108">It was not without a good deal of noise that they at last did so; and several times they paused, fearing that the alarm must have been given in the castle.</s> <s sid="109" id="winning.c3.s109">As, however, the door remained closed, they supposed that the occupants were fully engaged in defending themselves from the attacks of the earl's party.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="winning.c3.p55"><s sid="110" id="winning.c3.s110">When the door gave way, they found hanging across in front of them a very thick arras, and pressing this aside they entered a small room in the thickness of the wall of the keep.</s> <s sid="111" id="winning.c3.s111">It contained the merest slit for light, and was clearly unused.</s> <s sid="112" id="winning.c3.s112">Another door, this time unfastened, led into a larger apartment, which was also at present unoccupied.</s> <s sid="113" id="winning.c3.s113">They could hear now the shouts of the combatants without, the loud orders given by the leaders on the walls, the crack, as the stones hurled by the mangonels struck the walls, and the ring of steel as the arrows struck against steel cap and cuirass.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="winning.c3.p56" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="winning.c3.s114"><qs/>"It is fortunate that all were so well engaged, or they would certainly have heard the noise of our forcing the door, which would have brought all of them upon us.</s> <s sid="115" id="winning.c3.s115">As it is, we are in the heart of the keep.</s> <s sid="116" id="winning.c3.s116">We have now but to make a rush up these winding steps, and methinks we shall find ourselves on the battlements.</s> <s sid="117" id="winning.c3.s117">They will be so surprised, that no real resistance can be offered to us.</s> <s sid="118" id="winning.c3.s118">Now let us advance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="winning.c3.p57"><s sid="119" id="winning.c3.s119">So saying Cnut led the way upstairs, followed by the foresters, Cuthbert, as before, allowing five or six of them to intervene between him and the leader.</s> <s sid="120" id="winning.c3.s120">He carried his short sword and a quarterstaff, a weapon by no means to be despised in the hands of an active and experienced player.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="winning.c3.p58"><s sid="121" id="winning.c3.s121">Presently, after mounting some fifty or sixty steps, they issued on the platform of the keep.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="winning.c3.p59"><s sid="122" id="winning.c3.s122">Here were gathered some thirty or forty men, who were so busied in shooting with crossbows, and in working machines casting javelins, stones, and other missives upon the besiegers, that they were unaware of the addition to their numbers until the whole of the foresters had gathered on the summit, and at the order of Cnut suddenly fell upon them with a loud shout.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="winning.c3.p60"><s sid="123" id="winning.c3.s123">Taken wholly by surprise by the foe, who seemed to have risen from the bowels of the earth by magic, the soldiers of the Baron of Wortham offered but a feeble resistance.</s> <s sid="124" id="winning.c3.s124">Some were cast over the battlement of the keep, some driven down staircases, others cut down, and then Cuthbert, fastening a small white flag he had prepared to his quarter-staff, waved it above the battlements.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="winning.c3.p61"><s sid="125" id="winning.c3.s125">Even now the combatants on the outer wall were in ignorance of what had happened in the keep; so great was the din that the struggle which had there taken place had passed unnoticed; and it was not until the fugitives, rushing out into the courtyard, shouted that the keep had been captured, that the besieged became aware of the imminence of the danger.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="winning.c3.p62"><s sid="126" id="winning.c3.s126">Hitherto the battle had been going well for the defenders of the castle.</s> <s sid="127" id="winning.c3.s127">The Baron of Wortham was indeed surprised at the feebleness of the assault.</s> <s sid="128" id="winning.c3.s128">The arrows which had fallen in clouds upon the first day's attack upon the castle among his soldiers were now comparatively few and ineffective.</s> <s sid="129" id="winning.c3.s129">The besiegers scarcely appeared to push forward their bridges with any vigour, and it seemed to him that a coldness had fallen upon them, and that some disagreement must have arisen between the foresters and the earl, completely crippling the energy of the attack.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="winning.c3.p63"><s sid="130" id="winning.c3.s130">When he heard the words shouted from the courtyard below he could not believe his ears.</s> <s sid="131" id="winning.c3.s131">That the keep behind should have been carried by the enemy appeared to him impossible.</s> <s sid="132" id="winning.c3.s132">With a roar he called upon the bravest of his men to follow, and rushing across the courtyard, rapidly ascended the staircase.</s> <s sid="133" id="winning.c3.s133">The movement was observed from the keep, and Cnut and a few of his men, stationed themselves with their battle-axes at the top of various stairs leading below.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="winning.c3.p64"><s sid="134" id="winning.c3.s134">The signal shown by Cuthbert had not passed unobserved.</s> <s sid="135" id="winning.c3.s135">The earl, who had given instructions to his followers to make a mere feint of attacking, now blew the signal for the real onslaught.</s> <s sid="136" id="winning.c3.s136">The bridges were rapidly run across the moat, ladders were planted, and the garrison being paralyzed and confused by the attack in their rear, as well as hindered by the arrows which now flew down upon them from the keep above, offered but a feeble resistance, and the assailants, led by Sir Walter himself, poured over the walls.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER V. PREPARATIONS.</title>
<p pid="1" id="winning.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="winning.c5.s1">Next Sunday a large number of people from some miles round were gathered on the green at Evesham, to hear Father Francis preach on the holy sepulchre.</s> <s sid="2" id="winning.c5.s2">The forest men in their green jerkins mingled with the crowd, and a look of attention and seriousness was on the faces of all, for the news of the loss of the holy sepulchre had really exercised a great effect upon the minds of the people in England as elsewhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="winning.c5.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="winning.c5.s3">Those were the days of pilgrimage to holy places, when the belief in the sanctity of places and things was overwhelming, and when men believed that a journey to the holy shrines was sufficient to procure for them a pardon for all their misdeeds.</s> <s sid="4" id="winning.c5.s4">The very word <qs/>"infidel"<qe/> in those days was full of horror, and the thought that the holy places of the Christians were in the hands of Moslems, affected all Christians throughout Europe with a feeling of shame as well as of grief.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="winning.c5.p3"><s sid="5" id="winning.c5.s5">Among the crowd were many of the Norman retainers from the castle and from many of the holds around, and several knights with the ladies of their family stood a little apart from the edge of the gathering; for it was known that Father Francis would not be alone, but that he would be accompanied by a holy friar who had returned from the East, and who could tell of the cruelties which the Christians had suffered at the hands of the Saracens.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="winning.c5.p4"><s sid="6" id="winning.c5.s6">Father Francis, at ordinary times a tranquil preacher, was moved beyond himself by the theme on which he was holding forth.</s> <s sid="7" id="winning.c5.s7">He did not attempt to hide from those who stood around that the task to be undertaken was one of grievous peril and trial; that disease and heat, hunger and thirst, must be dared, as well as the sword of the infidel.</s> <s sid="8" id="winning.c5.s8">But he spoke of the grand nature of the work, of the humiliation to Christians of the desecration of the shrines, and of the glory which awaited those who joined the crusade, whether they lived or whether they died in the Holy Land.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="winning.c5.p5"><s sid="9" id="winning.c5.s9">His words had a strong effect upon the simple people who listened to him, but the feelings so aroused were as nought to the enthusiasm which greeted the address of the friar.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="winning.c5.p6"><s sid="10" id="winning.c5.s10">Meagre and pale, with a worn, anxious face as one who had suffered much, the friar, holding aloft two pieces of wood from the Mount of Olives tied together in the form of a cross, harangued the crowd.</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c5.s11">His words poured forth in a fiery stream, kindling the hearts, and stirring at once the devotion and the anger of his listeners.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c5.p7"><s sid="12" id="winning.c5.s12">He told of the holy places, he spoke of the scenes of Holy Writ, which had there been enacted; and then he depicted the men who had died for them.</s> <s sid="13" id="winning.c5.s13">He told of the knights and men-at-arms, each of whom proved himself again and again a match for a score of infidels.</s> <s sid="14" id="winning.c5.s14">He spoke of the holy women, who, fearlessly and bravely, as the knights themselves, had borne their share in the horrors of the siege and in the terrible times which had preceded it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="winning.c5.p8"><s sid="15" id="winning.c5.s15">He told them that this misfortune had befallen Christianity because of the lukewarmness which had come upon them.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="winning.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="winning.c5.s16"><qs/>"What profited it,"<qe/><sss/> he asked, <sse/><qs/>"if the few knights who remained to defend the holy sepulchre were heroes?</s> <s sid="17" id="winning.c5.s17">A few heroes cannot withstand an army.</s> <s sid="18" id="winning.c5.s18">If Christendom after making a mighty effort to capture the holy sepulchre had not fallen away, the conquest which had been made with so vast an expenditure of blood would not have been lost.</s> <s sid="19" id="winning.c5.s19">This is a work in which no mere passing fervour will avail; bravery at first, endurance afterwards, are needed.</s> <s sid="20" id="winning.c5.s20">Many men must determine not only to assist to wrest the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels, but to give their lives, so long as they might last, to retaining it.</s> <s sid="21" id="winning.c5.s21">It is scarce to be expected that men with wives and families will take a view like this, indeed it is not to be desired.</s> <s sid="22" id="winning.c5.s22">But there are single men, men of no ties, who can devote their whole lives, as did the Knights of the Orders of the Cross, to this great object.</s> <s sid="23" id="winning.c5.s23">When their life has come to an end, doubtless others will take up the banner that their hands can no longer hold.</s> <s sid="24" id="winning.c5.s24">But for life it is, indeed, that many of humble as well as of princely class must bind themselves to take and defend to death the holy sepulchre."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c5.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="winning.c5.s25">So, gradually raising the tone of his speech, the friar proceeded; until at length by his intense earnestness, his wild gesticulations, his impassioned words, he drew the whole of his listeners along with him; and when he ceased, a mighty shout of <qs/>"To the Holy Land!"<qe/> burst from his hearers.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c5.p11"><s sid="26" id="winning.c5.s26">Falling upon their knees, the crowd begged of him to give them the sign of the cross, and to bestow his blessing upon their swords, and upon their efforts.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="winning.c5.p12"><s sid="27" id="winning.c5.s27">Father Francis had prepared, in contemplation of such a movement, a large number of small white crosses of cloth.</s> <s sid="28" id="winning.c5.s28">These he and the friar now fastened to the shoulders of the men as they crowded up to receive it, holding their hands aloft, kissing the cross that the Friar extended to them, and swearing to give their lives, if need be, to rescue the holy shrines from the infidel.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="winning.c5.p13"><s sid="29" id="winning.c5.s29">When all had received the holy symbol, Father Francis again ascended the bank from which they had addressed the crowd:</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="winning.c5.p14" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="winning.c5.s30"><qs/>"Now go to your homes, my sons,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="31" id="winning.c5.s31"><qs/>"Think of the oath that you have taken, and of the course that lies open to you when the time comes.</s> <s sid="32" id="winning.c5.s32">When King Richard is prepared to start, then will you be called upon to fulfil your vows.</s> <s sid="33" id="winning.c5.s33">It may be that all who have sworn may not be called upon to go.</s> <s sid="34" id="winning.c5.s34">It needs that the land here should be tilled, it needs that there should be protectors for the women and children, it needs that this England of ours should flourish, and we cannot give all her sons, however willing they might be to take the cross.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c5.s35">But the willingness which you will, I am sure, show to go if needs be, and to redeem your vows, will be sufficient.</s> <s sid="36" id="winning.c5.s36">Some must go and some must stay; these are matters to be decided hereafter; for the time let us separate; you will hear when the hour for action arrives."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c5.p15"><s sid="37" id="winning.c5.s37">A fortnight later the Earl of Evesham, who had been on a long journey to London, returned with full authority to raise and organize a force as his contingent to the holy wars.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c5.p16"><s sid="38" id="winning.c5.s38">All was now bustle and activity in the castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c5.p17"><s sid="39" id="winning.c5.s39">Father Francis informed him of the willingness of such of the forest men as he deemed fit to enlist under his banner; and the earl was much gratified at finding that the ranks of heavily-armed retainers whom he would take with him, were to be swollen by the addition of so useful a contingent as that of 100 skilful archers.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c5.p18"><s sid="40" id="winning.c5.s40">Cuthbert was not long in asking for an interview with the earl.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c5.p19"><s sid="41" id="winning.c5.s41">He had indeed great difficulty in persuading Dame Editha that he was old enough to share in the fatigues of so great an expedition, but he had Father Francis on his side; and between the influence of her confessor, and the importunities of her son, the opposition of the good lady fell to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c5.p20"><s sid="42" id="winning.c5.s42">Cuthbert was already, for his age, well trained to arms.</s> <s sid="43" id="winning.c5.s43">Many of the old soldiers at the castle who had known and loved his father, had been ever ready to give lessons in the use of arms to Cuthbert, who was enthusiastic in his desire to prove as good a knight as his father had been.</s> <s sid="44" id="winning.c5.s44">His friends, the outlaws, had taught him the use of the bow and of the quarter-staff; and Cuthbert, strong and well-built for his age, and having little to do save to wield the sword and the bow, had attained a very considerable amount of skill with each.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c5.p21"><s sid="45" id="winning.c5.s45">He had too, which was unusual, a certain amount of book learning, although this, true to say, had not been acquired so cheerfully or willingly as the skill at arms.</s> <s sid="46" id="winning.c5.s46">Father Francis had, however, taught him to read and to write--accomplishments which were at that time rare, except in the cloister.</s> <s sid="47" id="winning.c5.s47">In those days if a knight had a firm seat in his saddle, a strong arm, a keen eye, and high courage, it was thought to be of little matter whether he could or could not do more than make his mark on the parchment.</s> <s sid="48" id="winning.c5.s48">The whole life of the young was given to acquiring skill in arms; and unless intended for the convent, any idea of education would in the great majority of cases have been considered as preposterous.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c5.p22"><s sid="49" id="winning.c5.s49">To do Cuthbert justice, he had protested with all his might against the proposition of Father Francis to his mother to teach him some clerkly knowledge.</s> <s sid="50" id="winning.c5.s50">He had yielded most unwillingly at last to her entreaties, backed as they were by the sound arguments and good sense of Father Francis.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="winning.c5.p23"><s sid="51" id="winning.c5.s51">The Earl of Evesham received Cuthbert's application very graciously.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="winning.c5.p24" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="winning.c5.s52"><qs/>"Certainly, Cuthbert,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"you shall accompany me; first, on account of my promise to you; secondly, because from the readiness you displayed both in the matter of my daughter and of the attack on Wortham, you will be a notable aid and addition to my party; thirdly, from my friendship for your father and Dame Editha."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="winning.c5.p25"><s sid="53" id="winning.c5.s53">This point being settled, Cuthbert at once assumed his new duties.</s> <s sid="54" id="winning.c5.s54">There was plenty for him to do--to see that the orders of the earl were properly carried out; to bear messages to the knights who followed the earl's fortunes, at their various holds; to stand by and watch the armourers at work, and the preparation of the stores of arms and missiles which would be necessary for the expedition.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="winning.c5.p26"><s sid="55" id="winning.c5.s55">Sometimes he would go round to summon the tenants of the various farms and lands, who held from the earl, to come to the castle; and here Sir Walter would, as far as might be without oppression, beg of them to contribute largely to the expedition.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="winning.c5.p27"><s sid="56" id="winning.c5.s56">In these appeals he was in no slight way assisted by Father Francis, who pointed out loudly to the people that those who stayed behind were bound to make as much sacrifice of their worldly goods, as those who went to the war might make of their lives.</s> <s sid="57" id="winning.c5.s57">Life and land are alike at the service of God.</s> <s sid="58" id="winning.c5.s58">Could the land be sold, it would be a good deed to sell it; but as this could not be, they should at least sell all that they could, and pledge their property if they could find lenders, in order to contribute to the needs of their lord, and the fitting out of this great enterprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="winning.c5.p28"><s sid="59" id="winning.c5.s59">The preparations were at last complete, and a gallant band gathered at the castle ready for starting.</s> <s sid="60" id="winning.c5.s60">It consisted of some 200 men-at-arms led by six knights, and of 100 bowmen dressed in Lincoln green, with quilted jerkins to keep out the arrows of the enemy.</s> <s sid="61" id="winning.c5.s61">All the country from around gathered to see the start.</s> <s sid="62" id="winning.c5.s62">Dame Editha was there, and by her side stood the earl's little daughter.</s> <s sid="63" id="winning.c5.s63">The earl himself was in armour, and beside him rode Cuthbert in the gay attire of a page.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="winning.c5.p29"><s sid="64" id="winning.c5.s64">Just at that moment, however, his face did not agree with his costume, for although he strove his best to look bright and smiling, it was a hard task to prevent the tears from filling his eyes at his departure from his mother.</s> <s sid="65" id="winning.c5.s65">The good lady cried unrestrainedly, and Margaret joined in her tears.</s> <s sid="66" id="winning.c5.s66">The people who had gathered round cheered lustily; the trumpets blew a gay fanfaronade; and the squire threw to the wind the earl's colours.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="winning.c5.p30"><s sid="67" id="winning.c5.s67">It was no mere pleasure trip on which they were starting, for all knew that, of the preceding crusades, not one in ten of those who had gone so gladly forth had ever returned.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="winning.c5.p31"><s sid="68" id="winning.c5.s68">It must not be supposed that the whole of those present were animated by any strong religious feeling.</s> <s sid="69" id="winning.c5.s69">No doubt there existed a desire, which was carefully fanned by the preaching of the priests and monks, to rescue the holy sepulchre from the hands of the Saracens; but a far stronger feeling was to be found in the warlike nature of the people in those days.</s> <s sid="70" id="winning.c5.s70">Knights, men-at-arms, and indeed men of all ranks, were full of a combative spirit.</s> <s sid="71" id="winning.c5.s71">Life in the castle and hut was alike dull and monotonous, and the excitement of war and adventure was greatly looked for, both as a means of obtaining glory and booty, and for the change they afforded to the dreary monotony of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="winning.c5.p32"><s sid="72" id="winning.c5.s72">There is little to tell of the journey of the Earl of Evesham's band through England to Southampton, at which place they took ship and crossed to France--or rather to Normandy, for in those days Normandy was regarded, as indeed it formed, a part of England.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="winning.c5.p33"><s sid="73" id="winning.c5.s73">Cuthbert, as was natural to his age, was full of delight at all the varying scenes through which they passed.</s> <s sid="74" id="winning.c5.s74">The towns were to him an especial source of wonder, for he had never visited any other than that of Worcester, to which he had once or twice been taken on occasions of high festival.</s> <s sid="75" id="winning.c5.s75">Havre was in those days an important place, and being the landing-place of a great portion of the English bands, it was full of bustle and excitement.</s> <s sid="76" id="winning.c5.s76">Every day ships brought in nobles and their followings.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="winning.c5.p34"><s sid="77" id="winning.c5.s77">The King of England was already in Normandy hastening the preparations, and each band, as it landed, marched down to the meeting-place on the plains of Vezelay.</s> <s sid="78" id="winning.c5.s78">Already they began to experience a taste of the hardships which they were to endure.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="winning.c5.p35"><s sid="79" id="winning.c5.s79">In those days there was no regular supply train for an army, but each division or band supported itself by purchase or pillage, as the case might be, from the surrounding country.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="winning.c5.p36"><s sid="80" id="winning.c5.s80">As the English troops were marching through a friendly country, pillage was of course strictly forbidden; but while many of the leaders paid for all they had, it must be owned that among the smaller leaders were many who took anything that they required with or without payment.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="winning.c5.p37"><s sid="81" id="winning.c5.s81">The country was eaten up.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="winning.c5.p38"><s sid="82" id="winning.c5.s82">The population in those days was sparse, and the movement of so large a number of men along a certain route completely exhausted all the resources of the inhabitants; and although willing to pay for all that his men required, the Earl of Evesham had frequently to lie down on the turf supperless himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="winning.c5.p39" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="winning.c5.s83"><qs/>"If this is the case now,"<qe/><sss/> he said to Cuthbert, <sse/><qs/>"what will it be after we have joined the French army?</s> <s sid="84" id="winning.c5.s84">Methinks whatever we may do if we reach the Holy Land, that we have a fair chance of being starved before we sail."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="winning.c5.p40"><s sid="85" id="winning.c5.s85">After a long succession of marches they arrived in sight of the great camp at Vezelay.</s> <s sid="86" id="winning.c5.s86">It was indeed rather a canvas town than a camp.</s> <s sid="87" id="winning.c5.s87">Here were gathered nearly 100,000 men, a vast host at any time, but in those days far greater in proportion to the strength of the countries than at present.</s> <s sid="88" id="winning.c5.s88">The tents of the leaders, nobles, and other knights and gentlemen, rose in regular lines, forming streets and squares.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="winning.c5.p41"><s sid="89" id="winning.c5.s89">The great mass of troops, however, were contented to sleep in the open air; indeed the difficulties of carriage were so great that it was only the leaders who could carry with them their canvas abodes.</s> <s sid="90" id="winning.c5.s90">Before each tent stood the lance and colours of its owner, and side by side in the centre of the camp stood the royal pavilions of Phillip of France and Richard of England, round which could be seen the gonfalons of all the nobles of Western Europe.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="winning.c5.p42"><s sid="91" id="winning.c5.s91">Nothing could be gayer than the aspect of this camp as the party rode into it.</s> <s sid="92" id="winning.c5.s92">They were rather late, and the great body of the host were already assembled.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="winning.c5.p43"><s sid="93" id="winning.c5.s93">Cuthbert gazed with delight at the varied colours, the gay dresses, the martial knights, and the air of discipline and order which reigned everywhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="winning.c5.p44"><s sid="94" id="winning.c5.s94">This was indeed war in its most picturesque form, a form which, as far as beauty is concerned, has been altogether altered, and indeed destroyed, by modern arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="winning.c5.p45"><s sid="95" id="winning.c5.s95">In those days individual prowess and bravery went for everything.</s> <s sid="96" id="winning.c5.s96">A handful of armoured knights were a match for thousands of footmen, and battles were decided as much by the prowess and bravery of the leader and his immediate following as by that of the great mass of the army.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="winning.c5.p46"><s sid="97" id="winning.c5.s97">The earl had the day before sent on a messenger to state that he was coming, and as the party entered the camp they were met by a squire of the camp-marshal, who conducted them to the position allotted to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="winning.c5.p47"><s sid="98" id="winning.c5.s98">The earl's tent was soon erected, with four or five grouped around it for his knights, one being set aside for his squires and pages.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="winning.c5.p48"><s sid="99" id="winning.c5.s99">When this was done, Cuthbert strolled away to look at the varied sights of the camp.</s> <s sid="100" id="winning.c5.s100">A military officer in these days would be scandalized at the scenes which were going on, but the strict, hard military discipline of modern times was then absolutely unknown.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="winning.c5.p49"><s sid="101" id="winning.c5.s101">A camp was a moving town, and to it flocked the country people with their goods; smiths and armourers erected their forges; minstrels and troubadours flocked in to sing of former battles, and to raise the spirits of the soldiers by merry lays of love and war; simple countrymen and women came in to bring their presents of fowls or cakes to their friends in camp; knights rode to and fro on their gaily caparisoned horses through the crowd; the newly raised levies, in many cases composed of woodmen and peasants who had not in the course of their lives wandered a league from their birthplaces, gaped in unaffected wonder at the sights around them; while last, but by no means least, the maidens and good wives of the neighbourhood, fond then as now of brave men and gay dresses, thronged the streets of the camp, and joined in, and were the cause of, merry laughter and jest.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="winning.c5.p50"><s sid="102" id="winning.c5.s102">Here and there, a little apart from the main stream of traffic, the minstrels would take up their position, and playing a gay air, the soldier lads and lasses would fall to and foot it merrily to the strains.</s> <s sid="103" id="winning.c5.s103">Sometimes there would be a break in the gaiety, and loud shouts, and perhaps fierce oaths, would rise.</s> <s sid="104" id="winning.c5.s104">Then the maidens would fly like startled fawns, and men hasten to the spot; though the quarrel might be purely a private one, yet should it happen between the retainers of two nobles, the friends of each would be sure to strike in, and serious frays would arise before the marshal of the camp with his posse could arrive to interfere.</s> <s sid="105" id="winning.c5.s105">Sometimes indeed these quarrels became so serious and desperate that alliances were broken up and great intentions frustrated by the quarrels of the soldiery.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="winning.c5.p51"><s sid="106" id="winning.c5.s106">Here and there, on elevated platforms, or even on the top of a pile of tubs, were friars occupied in haranguing the soldiers, and in inspiring them with enthusiasm for the cause upon which they were embarked.</s> <s sid="107" id="winning.c5.s107">The conduct of their listeners showed easily enough the motives which had brought them to war.</s> <s sid="108" id="winning.c5.s108">Some stood with clasped hands and eager eyes listening to the exhortations of the priests, and ready, as might be seen from their earnest gaze, to suffer martyrdom in the cause.</s> <s sid="109" id="winning.c5.s109">More, however, stood indifferently round, or after listening to a few words walked on with a laugh or a scoff; indeed preaching had already done all that lay in its power.</s> <s sid="110" id="winning.c5.s110">All those who could be moved by exhortations of this kind were there, and upon the rest the discourses and sermons were thrown away.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="winning.c5.p52"><s sid="111" id="winning.c5.s111">Several times in the course of his stroll round the camp Cuthbert observed the beginnings of quarrels, which were in each case only checked by the intervention of some knight or other person in authority coming past, and he observed that these in every instance occurred between men of the English and those of the French army.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="winning.c5.p53"><s sid="112" id="winning.c5.s112">Between the Saxon contingent of King Richard's army and the French soldiers there could indeed be no quarrel, for the Saxons understood no word of their language; but with the Normans the case was different, for the Norman-French, which was spoken by all the nobles and their retainers in Britain, was as nearly as possible the same as that in use in France.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="winning.c7.p34"><s sid="109" id="winning.c7.s109">Cuthbert gave an exclamation of pleasure.</s> <s sid="110" id="winning.c7.s110">His purse contained but a few pieces of silver, and being without arms except for his short dagger, or means of locomotion, the difficulties of the journey down to Marseilles had sorely puzzled him.</s> <s sid="111" id="winning.c7.s111">But with his good horse between his knees, and his suit of Milan armour on his back, he thought that he might make his way through any dangers which threatened him.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="winning.c7.p35"><s sid="112" id="winning.c7.s112">The prior now told the knight that circumstances had occurred, which showed that it was known to the assailants of Cuthbert that he had taken refuge in the convent, over which a strict watch had been kept by Cuthbert's enemies.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="winning.c7.p38"><s sid="121" id="winning.c7.s121">The knight willingly agreed to furnish four men-at-arms, and a trustworthy guide who would at least take him as far south as Avignon.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="winning.c7.p41"><s sid="129" id="winning.c7.s129">The arrangements were carried out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="winning.c8.p2"><s sid="3" id="winning.c8.s3">Cuthbert was pleased with the appearance of the man who had been placed at his disposal.</s> <s sid="4" id="winning.c8.s4">He was a young fellow of two-or-three-and-twenty, with an honest face.</s> <s sid="5" id="winning.c8.s5">He was, he told Cuthbert, the son of a small farmer near Avignon; but having a fancy for trade, he had been apprenticed to a master smith.</s> <s sid="6" id="winning.c8.s6">Having served his apprenticeship, he found that he had mistaken his vocation, and intended to return to the paternal vineyards.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="winning.c8.p3"><s sid="7" id="winning.c8.s7">Cuthbert calculated that he would make at least four days' journey to the south before he could meet with any dangers.</s> <s sid="8" id="winning.c8.s8">Doubtless his exit from the convent had been discovered, and the moment the gates of the city were opened the spy would have proceeded south to warn his comrades, and these would doubtless have taken a road which at a distance would again take them on to that by which Cuthbert would be now travelling.</s> <s sid="9" id="winning.c8.s9">As, however, he rode fast, and made long marches each day, he hoped that he might succeed in distancing them.</s> <s sid="10" id="winning.c8.s10">Unfortunately, upon the third day his horse cast his shoe, and no smith could be met with until the end of the day's journey.</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c8.s11">Consequently, but a short distance could be done, and this at a slow pace.</s> <s sid="12" id="winning.c8.s12">Upon the fifth day after their first start they arrived at a small town.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="winning.c8.p5"><s sid="17" id="winning.c8.s17">He felt sure now that he was overtaken, and determined to keep his eyes and faculties thoroughly on watch.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c8.p7"><s sid="21" id="winning.c8.s21">His horse was an excellent one, the gift of the earl, and he had little fear, with his light weight, of being overtaken, if he could once leave his enemies behind him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c8.p10"><s sid="24" id="winning.c8.s24">He had for some little time eased his horse down to a walk, as he felt that the wood would be the spot where he would in all probability be attacked, and he needed that his steed should be possessed of its utmost vigour.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c8.p11"><s sid="25" id="winning.c8.s25">At the spot where the track branched, a man in the guise of a mendicant was sitting.</s> <s sid="26" id="winning.c8.s26">He begged for alms, and Cuthbert threw him a small coin.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c8.p15"><s sid="31" id="winning.c8.s31">Cuthbert thanked him, and moved forward, still at a walk, along the right-hand road.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c8.p16"><s sid="32" id="winning.c8.s32">When he had gone about 200 yards, and was hidden from the sight of the man he had left--the country being rough, and scattered with clumps of bushes--he halted, and, as he expected, heard the sound of horses' hoofs coming on at full gallop along the other road.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="winning.c8.s33"><qs/>"Your master must have thought me young indeed,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"to try and catch me with such a transparent trick as that.</s> <s sid="34" id="winning.c8.s34">I do not suppose that accursed page has more than ten men with him, and doubtless has placed five on each road.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c8.s35">This fellow was placed here to see which track I would follow, and has now gone to give the party on the left hand the news that I have taken this way.</s> <s sid="36" id="winning.c8.s36">Had it not been for him I should have had to run the gauntlet with four or five of my enemies.</s> <s sid="37" id="winning.c8.s37">As it is, the path will doubtless be clear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c8.p18"><s sid="38" id="winning.c8.s38">So saying, he turned his horse, galloped back to the spot where the tracks separated, and then followed the left-hand route.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c8.p19"><s sid="39" id="winning.c8.s39">As he had hoped, he passed through the wood without incident or interruption, and arrived safely that night at a small town, having seen no signs of his enemies.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c8.p20"><s sid="40" id="winning.c8.s40">The next day he started again early, and rode on until mid-day, when he halted at a large village, at which was the only inn between the place from which he started and his destination.</s> <s sid="41" id="winning.c8.s41">He declined the offer of the servant of the inn to take his horse round to the stable, telling the man to hold him outside the door and give him from a sieve a few handfuls of grain.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c8.p21"><s sid="42" id="winning.c8.s42">Then he entered the inn and ate a hearty meal.</s> <s sid="43" id="winning.c8.s43">As he appeared at the door, he saw several men gathered near.</s> <s sid="44" id="winning.c8.s44">With a single spring he threw himself into the saddle, just as a rush forward was made by those standing round.</s> <s sid="45" id="winning.c8.s45">The man next to him sprang upon him, and endeavoured to drag him from the saddle.</s> <s sid="46" id="winning.c8.s46">Cuthbert drew the little dagger called a Mis,ricorde from his belt, and plunged it into his throat.</s> <s sid="47" id="winning.c8.s47">Then seizing the short mace which hung at the saddle bow, he hurled it with all his force full in the face of his enemy, the page of Sir Philip, who was rushing upon him sword in hand.</s> <s sid="48" id="winning.c8.s48">The heavy weapon struck him fairly between the eyes, and with a cry he fell back, his face completely smashed in by the blow, the sword which he held uplifted to strike flying far through the air.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c8.p22"><s sid="49" id="winning.c8.s49">Cuthbert struck his spurs into his horse, and the animal dashed forward with a bound, Cuthbert striking with his long sword at one or two men who made a snatch at the reins.</s> <s sid="50" id="winning.c8.s50">In another minute he was cantering out of the village, convinced that he had killed the leader of his foes, and that he was safe now to pursue the rest of his journey on to Marseilles.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="winning.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="winning.c9.s31">The fact that one of the speakers in the tent had used the words <qs/>"my sons,"<qe/> showed that one priest or monk, at least, was connected with the plot.</s> <s sid="32" id="winning.c9.s32">It was possible that this man might have power in one of the monasteries, or he might be an agent of the bishop himself; and Cuthbert saw that it would be easy enough in the night for a party from one or other of the monasteries to enter by the door of communication with the palace, and carry off the princess without the slightest alarm being given.</s> <s sid="33" id="winning.c9.s33">Once within the walls of the convent, she could be either hidden in the dungeons or secret places, which buildings of that kind were sure to possess, or could be at once carried out by some quiet entrance, and taken into the country, or transferred to some other building in the town.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c9.p15"><s sid="34" id="winning.c9.s34">When Cuthbert joined the earl he told him the observations that he had made, and Sir Walter praised the judgment which he had shown in his conclusions.</s> <s sid="35" id="winning.c9.s35">The earl was of opinion that it would be absolutely necessary to get some clue as to the course which the abductors purposed to take; indeed it was possible that on after-consideration they might drop their plan altogether, for the words which Cuthbert had overheard scarcely betokened a plan completely formed and finally decided upon.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c9.p16"><s sid="36" id="winning.c9.s36">The great point he considered, therefore, was that the tent of his old enemy should be carefully watched, and that an endeavour should be made to hear something of what passed within, which might give a clue to the plan fixed upon.</s> <s sid="37" id="winning.c9.s37">They did not, of course, know whether the tent in which the conversation had been heard by Cuthbert was that of Sir de Jacquelin Barras, or of one of the other persons who had spoken; and Cuthbert suggested that the first thing would be to find out whether the count, after nightfall, was in the habit of going to some other tent, or whether, on the other hand, he remained within, and was visited by others.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c9.p17"><s sid="38" id="winning.c9.s38">It was easy, of course, to discover which was his tent; and Cuthbert soon got its position, and then took Cnut into his counsels.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="winning.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="winning.c17.s1">The tremendous exertions which King Richard had made told upon him, and attacks of fever succeeded each other at short intervals.</s> <s sid="2" id="winning.c17.s2">This, however, mattered the less, since negotiations were now proceeding between him and Saladin.</s> <s sid="3" id="winning.c17.s3">It was impossible, with the slight means at his disposal, for Richard further to carry on the crusade alone.</s> <s sid="4" id="winning.c17.s4">Moreover, pressing news had arrived from his mother in England, urging him to return, as his brother John was intriguing against him, and had already assumed all but the kingly tide.</s> <s sid="5" id="winning.c17.s5">Saladin was equally desirous of peace.</s> <s sid="6" id="winning.c17.s6">His wild troops were, for the most part, eager to return to their homes, and the defeats which they had suffered, and the, to them, miraculous power of King Richard's arm, had lowered their spirit and made them eager to be away.</s> <s sid="7" id="winning.c17.s7">Therefore he consented without difficulty to the terms proposed.</s> <s sid="8" id="winning.c17.s8">By these, the Christians were to surrender Ascalon, but were to keep Jaffa, Tyre, and the fortresses along the coast.</s> <s sid="9" id="winning.c17.s9">All hostilities were to be suspended on both sides for the space of three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours, when Richard hoped to return again and to recommence the struggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="winning.c17.p2"><s sid="10" id="winning.c17.s10">Between the sultan and King Richard a feeling approaching that of friendship had sprung up during the campaign.</s> <s sid="11" id="winning.c17.s11">Saladin was himself brave in the extreme, and exposed his life as fearlessly as did his Christian rival, and the two valiant leaders recognized the great qualities of each other.</s> <s sid="12" id="winning.c17.s12">Several times during the campaign, when Richard had been ill, the emir had sent him presents of fruit and other matters, to which Richard had responded in the same spirit.</s> <s sid="13" id="winning.c17.s13">An interview had taken place between them which further cemented their friendship; and when Richard promised to return again at the end of the truce with a far larger army, and to accomplish the rescue of the holy city, the sultan smiled, and said that it appeared that valour alone was not sufficient to conquer in the Holy Land, but that if Jerusalem were to fall into the hands of the Christians, it could fall into no worthier hands than those of Malek-Rik.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="winning.c17.p3"><s sid="14" id="winning.c17.s14">So, with many mutual courtesies, the great rivals separated, and, soon after, King Richard and the little remnant of his army embarked on board ship, and set sail for England.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="winning.c17.p4"><s sid="15" id="winning.c17.s15">It was on the 11th of October, 1192, that Richard Coeur de Lion left Palestine.</s> <s sid="16" id="winning.c17.s16">Soon after they started, a storm suddenly burst upon them, and dispersed them in various directions.</s> <s sid="17" id="winning.c17.s17">The ship in which Queen Berengaria was carried, arrived safely in Sicily; but that in which King Richard was borne was missing, and none of his fellow-voyagers knew what had become of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="winning.c17.p5"><s sid="18" id="winning.c17.s18">Sir Cuthbert was in the same vessel as the king, and the bark was driven upon the Island of Corfu.</s> <s sid="19" id="winning.c17.s19">All reached shore in safety, and King Richard then hired three small vessels, in which he sailed to the port of Zara, whence he hoped to reach the domains of his nephew, Otho of Saxony, the son of his sister Matilda.</s> <s sid="20" id="winning.c17.s20">The king had with him now but two of his knights, Baldwin of B,thune, and Cuthbert of Evesham.</s> <s sid="21" id="winning.c17.s21">Cnut was with his feudal chief--for such Cuthbert had now, by his accession to the rank of Earl of Evesham, become--and three or four English archers.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="winning.c17.p7" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="winning.c17.s37"><qs/>"Surely,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said, <sse/><qs/>"no potentate could for very shame venture to detain your Majesty on your way from the Holy Land, where you have wrought such great deeds.</s> <s sid="38" id="winning.c17.s38">Were I in your place, I would at once proclaim myself, mount my horse, have my banner carried before me, and ride openly on.</s> <s sid="39" id="winning.c17.s39">You have, too, another claim, namely, that of being shipwrecked, and even in war-time nations respect those whom the force of God has thrown upon their shores."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="winning.c17.p8" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="winning.c17.s40"><qs/>"I fear me, Sir Cuthbert,"<qe/><sss/> Sir Baldwin said, <sse/><qs/>"that you overrate the chivalry of our master's enemies.</s> <s sid="41" id="winning.c17.s41">Had we been thrown on the shores of France, Philip perhaps would hesitate to lay hands upon the king; but these petty German princelings have no idea of the observances of true chivalry.</s> <s sid="42" id="winning.c17.s42">They are coarse and brutal in their ways; and though in outward form following the usages of knighthood, they have never been penetrated with its spirit.</s> <s sid="43" id="winning.c17.s43">If the friends of Conrad of Montferat lay hands upon King Richard, I fear that no scruples will prevent them from using their advantage to the utmost.</s> <s sid="44" id="winning.c17.s44">Even their emperor I would not trust.</s> <s sid="45" id="winning.c17.s45">The course which you advise would no doubt be in accordance with the spirit of King Richard; but it would be madness for him to judge other people's spirit by his own, and it would be rushing into the lion's den to proclaim himself here.</s> <s sid="46" id="winning.c17.s46">I should recommend, if I might venture to do so, that his Majesty should assume a false name, and that we should travel in small parties so as to attract no attention, each making his way to Saxony as best he may."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="winning.c17.p9"><s sid="47" id="winning.c17.s47">There was silence for a minute or two, and then the king with a sigh, said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="winning.c17.p10" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="winning.c17.s48"><qs/>"I fear that you are right, Sir Baldwin, and that there is no chivalry among these swinish German lords.</s> <s sid="49" id="winning.c17.s49">You shall accompany me.</s> <s sid="50" id="winning.c17.s50">Not, Sir Cuthbert,"<qe/><sls/> he observed kindly, noticing a look of disappointment upon the face of the young knight, <sle/><qs/>"that I estimate your fidelity one whit lower than that of my brave friend; but he is the elder and the more versed in European travel, and may manage to bring matters through better than you would do.</s> <s sid="51" id="winning.c17.s51">You will have dangers enough to encounter yourself, more even than I shall, for your brave follower, Cnut, can speak no language but his own, and your archers will be hard to pass as any other than what they are.</s> <s sid="52" id="winning.c17.s52">You must be my messenger to England, should you arrive there without me.</s> <s sid="53" id="winning.c17.s53">Tell my mother and wife where you left me, and that, if I do not come home I have fallen into the hands of one or other of my bitter foes.</s> <s sid="54" id="winning.c17.s54">Bid them bestir themselves to hold England for me against my brother John, and, if needs be, to move the sovereigns of Europe to free me from the hands of my enemies.</s> <s sid="55" id="winning.c17.s55">Should a ransom be needed, I think that my people of England will not grudge their goods for their king."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="winning.c17.p11"><s sid="56" id="winning.c17.s56">The following day the king bade farewell to his faithful followers, giving his hand to kiss, not only to Sir Cuthbert, but to Cnut and his archers.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="winning.c17.p12" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="winning.c17.s57"><qs/>"You have done me brave service,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"and I trust may yet have occasion to do it again.</s> <s sid="58" id="winning.c17.s58">These are bad times when Richard of England has nought wherewith to reward his friends.</s> <s sid="59" id="winning.c17.s59">But,"<qe/><sls/> he said, taking a gold chain from his neck and breaking it with his strong fingers into five fragments, <sle/><qs/>"that is for you, Cnut, and for your four archers, in remembrance of King Richard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="winning.c17.p13"><s sid="60" id="winning.c17.s60">The men, albeit hardened by many scenes of warfare, yet shed tears plenteously at parting with the king.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="winning.c17.p14" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="winning.c17.s61"><qs/>"We had better,"<qe/><sls/> Cuthbert said to them when they were alone, <sle/><qs/>"delay here for a few days.</s> <s sid="62" id="winning.c17.s62">If we are taken, the news that some Englishmen have been captured making their way north from Zara will spread rapidly, and may cause the enemies of Richard to be on the look-out for him, suspecting that the ship which bore us may also have carried him; for the news that he is missing will spread rapidly through Europe, and will set all his enemies on the alert."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="winning.c17.p15"><s sid="63" id="winning.c17.s63">In accordance with this plan, they delayed for another ten days at Zara, and then, hiring a small boat, were landed some thirty miles further along the coast.</s> <s sid="64" id="winning.c17.s64">Cuthbert had obtained for Cnut the dress of a palmer, as in this he would pass almost unquestioned, and his silence might be accounted for on the ground that he had taken a vow of silence.</s> <s sid="65" id="winning.c17.s65">He himself had placed on his coat and armour a red cross, instead of the white cross borne by the English knights, and would now pass as a French knight.</s> <s sid="66" id="winning.c17.s66">Similar changes were made in the dress of his followers, and he determined to pass as a French noble who had been wrecked on his way home, and who was returning through Germany to France.</s> <s sid="67" id="winning.c17.s67">The difficulties in his own case would not be serious, as his French would pass muster anywhere in Germany.</s> <s sid="68" id="winning.c17.s68">The greatest difficulty would be with his attendants; but he saw no way of avoiding this.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="winning.c17.p16"><s sid="69" id="winning.c17.s69">Cuthbert's object, when with his little party he separated from King Richard, was to make his way to Verona, thence cross by Trent into Bavaria, and so to journey to Saxony.</s> <s sid="70" id="winning.c17.s70">Fortunately he had, at the storming of Acre, become possessed of a valuable jewel, and this he now sold, and purchased a charger for himself.</s> <s sid="71" id="winning.c17.s71">He had little fear of any trouble in passing through the north of Italy, for this was neutral ground, where knights of all nations met, and where, neither as an English nor a French crusader would he attract either comment or attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="winning.c17.p17"><s sid="72" id="winning.c17.s72">It was a slow journey across the northern plains, as of course he had to accommodate his pace to that of his men.</s> <s sid="73" id="winning.c17.s73">Cnut and the archers had grumbled much at the change in the colour of the cross upon their jerkins; and, as Cnut said, would have been willing to run greater perils under their true colours than to affect to belong to any other nationality.</s> <s sid="74" id="winning.c17.s74">On their way they passed through Padua, and there stopped a few days.</s> <s sid="75" id="winning.c17.s75">Cuthbert could but feel, in looking at the splendour of this Italian city, the courteous manner of its people, and the university which was even then famous, how far in advance were those stately cities of Italy to Western Europe.</s> <s sid="76" id="winning.c17.s76">His followers were as much surprised as himself at the splendour of the city.</s> <s sid="77" id="winning.c17.s77">Here they experienced no trouble or annoyance whatever, for to the cities of Italy knights of all nations resorted, learned men came to study, philosophers to dispute, and as these brought their attendants with them, you might in the streets of Padua and its sister cities hear every language in Europe spoken.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="winning.c17.p18"><s sid="78" id="winning.c17.s78">From Padua they journeyed to Verona, marvelling greatly at the richness of the country.</s> <s sid="79" id="winning.c17.s79">The footmen, however, grumbled at the flatness of the plain, and said that it was as bad as marching in the Holy Land.</s> <s sid="80" id="winning.c17.s80">On their right, however, the slopes of the Alps, thickly clad with forests, reached down nearly to the road, and Cuthbert assured them that they would have plenty of climbing before they had done.</s> <s sid="81" id="winning.c17.s81">At Verona they tarried again, and wondered much at the great amphitheatre, then almost perfect.</s> <s sid="82" id="winning.c17.s82">Cuthbert related to Cnut and the archers, how men had there been set to fight, while the great stone benches round were thronged with men and women looking on at their death struggles, and said that not unfrequently British captives were brought hither and made to contend in the arena.</s> <s sid="83" id="winning.c17.s83">The honest fellows were full of indignation and horror at the thought of men killing themselves to give sport to others.</s> <s sid="84" id="winning.c17.s84">They were used to hard knocks, and thought but little of their life, and would have betaken themselves to their bows and bills without hesitation in case of a quarrel.</s> <s sid="85" id="winning.c17.s85">But to fight in cold blood for amusement seemed to them very terrible.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="winning.c17.p19"><s sid="86" id="winning.c17.s86">Cuthbert would then have travelled on to Milan at that time next to Rome the richest city in Europe, but he longed to be back in England, and was the more anxious as he knew that King Richard would be passing through great dangers, and he hoped to meet him at the Court of Saxony.</s> <s sid="87" id="winning.c17.s87">His money, too, was fast running out, and he found that it would be beyond his slender means to extend his journey so far.</s> <s sid="88" id="winning.c17.s88">At Verona, then, they turned their back on the broad plains of Lombardy, and entered the valley of the Trent.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="winning.c17.p20"><s sid="89" id="winning.c17.s89">So far no observation whatever had been excited by the passage of the English knight.</s> <s sid="90" id="winning.c17.s90">So many crusaders were upon their way home, many in grievous plight, that the somewhat shabby retinue passed unnoticed.</s> <s sid="91" id="winning.c17.s91">But they were now leaving Italy, and entering a country where German was spoken.</s> <s sid="92" id="winning.c17.s92">Trent, in those days an important city, was then, and is still, the meeting place of Italy and Germany.</s> <s sid="93" id="winning.c17.s93">Both tongues are here spoken; but while the Italian perhaps preponderates, the customs, manners, and mode of thought of the people belong to those of the mountaineers of the Tyrol, rather than of the dwellers on the plains.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="winning.c17.p21" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="winning.c17.s94"><qs/>"You are choosing a stormy time,"<qe/> the landlord of the hostelry where they put up said to Cuthbert.</s> <s sid="95" id="winning.c17.s95"><qs/>"The winter is now at hand, and storms sweep across the passes with terrible violence.</s> <s sid="96" id="winning.c17.s96">You had better, at the last village you come to in the valley, obtain the services of a guide, for should a snowstorm come on when you are crossing, the path will be lost, and nothing will remain but a miserable death.</s> <s sid="97" id="winning.c17.s97">By daylight the road is good.</s> <s sid="98" id="winning.c17.s98">It has been cut with much trouble, and loaded mules can pass over without difficulty.</s> <s sid="99" id="winning.c17.s99">Poles have been erected at short distances to mark the way when the snow covers it.</s> <s sid="100" id="winning.c17.s100">But when the snowstorms sweep across the mountains, it is impossible to see ten paces before you, and if the traveller leaves the path he is lost."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="winning.c17.p22" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="winning.c17.s101"><qs/>"But I suppose,"<qe/><sss/> Cuthbert said, <sse/><qs/>"that even in winter travellers pass over?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="winning.c17.p24"><s sid="110" id="winning.c17.s110">Obtaining the address of a merchant who kept these things, Cuthbert proceeded thither; and purchased five cloaks of goat-skin with hoods to pull over their heads for his followers, while for himself he obtained one of rather finer material.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="winning.c17.p25"><s sid="111" id="winning.c17.s111">Another two days' journey brought them to the foot of the steep ascent, and here they hired the services of a guide.</s> <s sid="112" id="winning.c17.s112">The ascent was long and difficult, and in spite of the praises which the host had bestowed upon the road, it was so steep that Cuthbert was, for the most part, obliged to walk, leading his steed, whose feet slipped on the smooth rock, and as in many places a false step would have thrown them down many hundreds of feet into the valley below, Cuthbert judged it safer to trust himself to his own feet.</s> <s sid="113" id="winning.c17.s113">He disencumbered himself of his helmet and gorget, and placed these upon the horse's back.</s> <s sid="114" id="winning.c17.s114">At nightfall they had attained a very considerable height, and stopped at one of the small refuges of which the landlord had spoken.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="winning.c17.p26" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="winning.c17.s115"><qs/>"I like not the look of the weather,"<qe/> the guide said in the morning--at least that was what Cuthbert judged him to say, for he could speak no word of the man's language.</s> <s sid="116" id="winning.c17.s116">His actions, however, as he looked towards the sky, and shook his head, spoke for themselves, and Cuthbert, feeling his own powerlessness in a situation so novel to him, felt serious misgivings at the prospect.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="winning.c17.p27"><s sid="117" id="winning.c17.s117">The scenery was now very wild.</s> <s sid="118" id="winning.c17.s118">On all sides crags and mountain tops covered with snow glistened in the sun.</s> <s sid="119" id="winning.c17.s119">The woods near the path were free of snow; but higher up they rose black above the white ground.</s> <s sid="120" id="winning.c17.s120">The wind blew keenly, and all rejoiced in the warm cloaks which they had obtained; for even with the protection of these they had found the cold bitter during the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="winning.c23.p61"><s sid="176" id="winning.c23.s176">The following morning, early, the castle rang with the din of preparation.</s> <s sid="177" id="winning.c23.s177">The great portion of the mercenaries were encamped in tents outside the walls, for, spacious as it was, Evesham could hardly contain 400 men in addition to its usual garrison.</s> <s sid="178" id="winning.c23.s178">The men-at-arms were provided with heavy axes to cut their way through the bushes.</s> <s sid="179" id="winning.c23.s179">Some carried bundles of straw, to fire the wood should it be found practicable to do so; and as it was now summer and the wind was blowing high, Sir Rudolph hoped that the dry grass and bushes would catch, and would do more even than his men-at-arms in clearing the forest of those whom he designated the villains infesting it.</s> <s sid="180" id="winning.c23.s180">They had, too, with them several fierce dogs trained to hunting the deer, and these, the knight hoped, would do good service in tracking the outlaws.</s> <s sid="181" id="winning.c23.s181">He and the knights and the men-at-arms with him were all dismounted, for he felt that horses would in the forest be an encumbrance, and he was determined himself to lead the way to the men-at-arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="winning.c23.p62"><s sid="182" id="winning.c23.s182">When they reached the forest, they were saluted by a shower of arrows; but as all were clad in mail, these at a distance effected but little harm.</s> <s sid="183" id="winning.c23.s183">As they came closer, however, the clothyard arrows began to pierce the coarse and ill-made armour of the foot soldiers, although the finer armour of the knight kept out the shafts which struck against it.</s> <s sid="184" id="winning.c23.s184">Sir Rudolph and his knights leading the way, they entered the forest, and gradually pressed their invisible foe backwards through the trees.</s> <s sid="185" id="winning.c23.s185">The dogs did good service, going on ahead and attacking the archers; but, one by one, they were soon shot, and the assailants left to their own devices.</s> <s sid="186" id="winning.c23.s186">Several attempts were made to fire the wood.</s> <s sid="187" id="winning.c23.s187">But these failed, the fire burning but a short time and then dying out of itself.</s> <s sid="188" id="winning.c23.s188">In addition to the fighting men, Sir Rudolph had impressed into the service all the serfs of his domain, and these, armed with axes, were directed to cut down the trees as the force proceeded, Sir Rudolph declaring that he would not cease until he had levelled the whole forest, though it might take him months to do so.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="winning.c23.p63"><s sid="189" id="winning.c23.s189">The assailants gained ground steadily, the resistance being less severe than Sir Rudolph had anticipated.</s> <s sid="190" id="winning.c23.s190">Several small huts and clearings in the forest which had been used by the outlaws, and round which small crops had been planted, were destroyed, and all seemed to promise well for the success of the enterprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="winning.c23.p64"><s sid="191" id="winning.c23.s191">It was about two hours after they had left the castle, when a heavy cart filled with faggots was seen approaching its gates.</s> <s sid="192" id="winning.c23.s192">The garrison, who had not the least fear of any attack, paid no attention to it until it reached the edge of the moat.</s> <s sid="193" id="winning.c23.s193">Then the warder, seeing that it contained faggots, lowered the drawbridge without question, raised the portcullis, and opened the gates.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="winning.c23.p65" type="speech"><s sid="194" id="winning.c23.s194"><qs/>"From whom do you bring this wood?"<qe/> he asked, as the man driving the oxen began to cross the bridge.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="winning.c23.p68"><s sid="198" id="winning.c23.s198">The heavy-waggon crossed the drawbridge, but as it was entering the gate it came suddenly to a stop.</s> <s sid="199" id="winning.c23.s199">With a blow of his ox goad Cnut levelled the warder to the ground, and cutting the cords of the bullocks, drove them into the yard ahead.</s> <s sid="200" id="winning.c23.s200">As he did so the pile of faggots fell asunder, and twelve men armed with bow and pike leaped out.</s> <s sid="201" id="winning.c23.s201">The men-at-arms standing near, lounging in the courtyard, gave a shout of alarm, and the garrison, surprised at this sudden cry, ran to their arms.</s> <s sid="202" id="winning.c23.s202">At first they were completely panic-stricken.</s> <s sid="203" id="winning.c23.s203">But seeing after a time how small was the number of their assailants, they took heart and advanced against them.</s> <s sid="204" id="winning.c23.s204">The passage was narrow, and the twelve men formed a wall across it.</s> <s sid="205" id="winning.c23.s205">Six of them with their pikes advanced, the other six with bent bows standing behind them and delivering their arrows between their heads.</s> <s sid="206" id="winning.c23.s206">The garrison fought stoutly, and although losing many, were pressing the little band backwards.</s> <s sid="207" id="winning.c23.s207">In vain the assistant-warder tried to lower the portcullis, or to close the gates.</s> <s sid="208" id="winning.c23.s208">The former fell on to the top of the waggon, and was there retained.</s> <s sid="209" id="winning.c23.s209">The gates also were barred by the obstacle.</s> <s sid="210" id="winning.c23.s210">The chains of the drawbridge had at once been cut.</s> <s sid="211" id="winning.c23.s211">Cnut encouraged his followers by his shouts, and armed with a heavy axe, did good service upon the assailants.</s> <s sid="212" id="winning.c23.s212">But four of his party had fallen, and the rest were giving way, when a shout was heard, and over the drawbridge poured Cuthbert and 150 of the outlaws of the forest.</s> <s sid="213" id="winning.c23.s213">Struck with terror at this attack, the garrison drew back, and the foresters poured into the yard.</s> <s sid="214" id="winning.c23.s214">For a few minutes there was a fierce fight; but the defenders of the castle, disheartened and taken by surprise, were either cut down or, throwing down their arms, cried for quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="winning.c23.p69"><s sid="215" id="winning.c23.s215">Ten minutes after the waggon had crossed the drawbridge, the castle was safely in possession of Sir Cuthbert.</s> <s sid="216" id="winning.c23.s216">The bridge was raised, the waggon removed, the portcullis lowered, and to the external eye all remained as before.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="winning.c23.p70"><s sid="217" id="winning.c23.s217">Cuthbert at once made his way to the chamber where the Lady Margaret was confined, and her joy at her deliverance was great indeed.</s> <s sid="218" id="winning.c23.s218">So unlimited was her faith in Sir Cuthbert that she had never lost confidence; and although it did not seem possible that in the face of such disparity of numbers he could rescue her from the power of Sir Rudolph, yet she had not given up hope.</s> <s sid="219" id="winning.c23.s219">The joy of the farmers' daughters who had been carried off to act as her attendants was little inferior to her own; for once in the power of this reckless baron, the girls had small hopes of ever being allowed to return again to their parents.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="winning.c23.p71"><s sid="220" id="winning.c23.s220">The flag of Sir Rudolph was thrown down from the keep, and that of the late earl hoisted in its stead; for Cuthbert himself, although he had assumed the cognizance which King Richard had granted him, had not yet any flag or pennon emblazoned with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="winning.c23.p72"><s sid="221" id="winning.c23.s221">No words can portray the stupefaction and rage of Sir Rudolph when a man who had managed to slip unobserved from the castle at the time of its capture, bore the news to him in the forest.</s> <s sid="222" id="winning.c23.s222">All opposition there had ceased, and the whole of the troops were engaged in aiding the peasants in cutting wide roads through the trees across the forest, so as to make it penetrable by horsemen in every direction.</s> <s sid="223" id="winning.c23.s223">It was supposed that the outlaws had gradually stolen away through the thickets and taken to the open country, intending to scatter to their homes, or other distant hiding-places; and the news that they had by a ruse captured the castle, came as a thunderclap.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="winning.c23.p73"><s sid="224" id="winning.c23.s224">Sir Rudolph's first impulse was to call his men together and to march towards the castle.</s> <s sid="225" id="winning.c23.s225">The drawbridge was up, and the walls bristled with armed men.</s> <s sid="226" id="winning.c23.s226">It was useless to attempt a parley; still more useless to think of attacking the stronghold without the proper machines and appliances.</s> <s sid="227" id="winning.c23.s227">Foaming with rage, Sir Rudolph took possession of a cottage near, camped his men around and prepared for a siege.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="winning.c23.p74"><s sid="228" id="winning.c23.s228">There were among the mercenaries many men accustomed to the use of engines of war.</s> <s sid="229" id="winning.c23.s229">Many, too, had aided in making them; and these were at once set to work to construct the various machines in use at that time.</s> <s sid="230" id="winning.c23.s230">Before the invention of gunpowder, castles such as those of the English barons were able to defy any attack by an armed force for a long period.</s> <s sid="231" id="winning.c23.s231">Their walls were so thick that even the balistas, casting huge stones, were unable to breach them except after a very long time.</s> <s sid="232" id="winning.c23.s232">The moats which surrounded them were wide and deep, and any attempt at storming by ladders was therefore extremely difficult; and these buildings were consequently more often captured by famine than by other means.</s> <s sid="233" id="winning.c23.s233">Of provisions, as Sir Rudolph knew, there was a considerable supply at present in the castle, for he had collected a large number of bullocks in order to feed the strong body who had been added to the garrison.</s> <s sid="234" id="winning.c23.s234">The granaries, too, were well stored; and with a groan Sir Rudolph thought of the rich stores of French wines which he had collected in his cellars.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="winning.c23.p75"><s sid="235" id="winning.c23.s235">After much deliberation with the knights with him and the captain of the mercenaries, it was agreed in the first instance to attempt to attack the place by filling up a portion of the moat and ascending by scaling ladders.</s> <s sid="236" id="winning.c23.s236">Huge screens of wood were made, and these were placed on waggons; the waggons themselves were filled with bags of earth, and a large number of men getting beneath them shoved the ponderous machines forward to the edge of the moat.</s> <s sid="237" id="winning.c23.s237">The bags of stones and earth were then thrown in, and the waggons pushed backwards to obtain a fresh supply.</s> <s sid="238" id="winning.c23.s238">This operation was of course an exceedingly slow one, a whole day being occupied with each trip of the waggons.</s> <s sid="239" id="winning.c23.s239">They were not unmolested in their advance, for, from the walls, mangonels and other machines hurled great stones down upon the wooden screens, succeeding sometimes, in spite of their thickness, in crashing through them, killing many of the men beneath.</s> <s sid="240" id="winning.c23.s240">The experiment was also tried of throwing balls of Greek fire down upon the wood; but as this was green and freshly felled it would not take fire, but the flames dropping through, with much boiling pitch and other materials, did grievously burn and scald the soldiers working below it.</s> <s sid="241" id="winning.c23.s241">Upon both sides every device was tried.</s> <s sid="242" id="winning.c23.s242">The cross-bow men among the mercenaries kept up a fire upon the walls to hinder the defenders from interfering with the operations, while the archers above shot steadily, and killed many of those who ventured within range of their bows.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="winning.c23.p76"><s sid="243" id="winning.c23.s243">After ten days' labour, a portion of the moat some twenty yards in length was filled with bags of earth, and all was ready for the assault.</s> <s sid="244" id="winning.c23.s244">The besiegers had prepared great numbers of strong ladders, and these were brought up under shelter of the screens.</s> <s sid="245" id="winning.c23.s245">Then, all being ready, the trumpets sounded for the assault, and the troops moved forward in a close body, covering themselves with their shields so that no man's head or body was visible, each protecting the one before him with his shield held over him.</s> <s sid="246" id="winning.c23.s246">Thus the body presented the appearance of a great scale-covered animal.</s> <s sid="247" id="winning.c23.s247">In many respects, indeed, the warfare of those days was changed in no way from that of the time of the Romans.</s> <s sid="248" id="winning.c23.s248">In the 1200 years which had elapsed between the siege of Jerusalem and the days of the crusades there had been but little change in arms or armour, and the operations which Titus undertook for the reduction of the Jewish stronghold differed but little from those which a Norman baron employed in besieging his neighbour's castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="winning.c23.p77"><s sid="249" id="winning.c23.s249">Within Evesham Castle all was contentment and merriment during these days.</s> <s sid="250" id="winning.c23.s250">The garrison had no fear whatever of being unable to repel the assault when it should be delivered.</s> <s sid="251" id="winning.c23.s251">Huge stones had been collected in numbers on the walls, cauldrons of pitch, beneath which fires kept simmering, stood there in readiness.</s> <s sid="252" id="winning.c23.s252">Long poles with hooks with which to seize the ladders and cut them down were laid there; and all that precaution and science could do was prepared.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="winning.c23.p78"><s sid="253" id="winning.c23.s253">Cuthbert passed much of the day, when not required upon the walls, chatting with the Lady Margaret, who, attended by her maidens, sat working in her bower.</s> <s sid="254" id="winning.c23.s254">She had learnt to read from the good nuns of the convent--an accomplishment which was by no means general, even among the daughters of nobles; but books were rare, and Evesham boasted but few manuscripts.</s> <s sid="255" id="winning.c23.s255">Here Margaret learnt in full all the details of Cuthbert's adventures since leaving England, and the fondness with which as a child she had regarded the lad grew gradually into the affection of a woman.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="winning.c23.p79"><s sid="256" id="winning.c23.s256">The courage of the garrison was high, for although they believed that sooner or later the castle might be carried by the besiegers, they had already been told by Cnut that there was a means of egress unknown to the besiegers, and that when the time came they would be able to escape unharmed.</s> <s sid="257" id="winning.c23.s257">This, while it in no way detracted from their determination to defend the castle to the last, yet rendered their task a far lighter and more agreeable one than it would have been had they seen the gallows standing before them as the end of the siege.</s> <s sid="258" id="winning.c23.s258">As the testudo, as it was called in those days, advanced towards the castle, the machines upon the walls--catapults, mangonels, and arbalasts--poured forth showers of stones and darts upon it, breaking up the array of shields and killing many; and as these openings were made, the archers, seizing their time, poured in volleys of arrows.</s> <s sid="259" id="winning.c23.s259">The mercenaries, however, accustomed to war, advanced steadily, and made good their footing beneath the castle wall, and proceeded to rear their ladders.</s> <s sid="260" id="winning.c23.s260">Here, although free from the action of the machines, they were exposed to the hand missiles, which were scarcely less destructive.</s> <s sid="261" id="winning.c23.s261">In good order, and with firmness, however, they reared the ladders, and mounted to the assault, covering themselves as well as they could with their shields.</s> <s sid="262" id="winning.c23.s262">In vain, however, did they mount.</s> <s sid="263" id="winning.c23.s263">The defenders poured down showers of boiling pitch and oil, which penetrated the crevices of their armour, and caused intolerable torment.</s> <s sid="264" id="winning.c23.s264">Great stones were toppled over from the battlements upon them; and sometimes the ladders, seized by the poles with hooks, were cast backwards, with all upon them, on the throng below.</s> <s sid="265" id="winning.c23.s265">For half-an-hour, encouraged by the shouts of Sir Rudolph and their leaders, the soldiers strove gallantly; but were at last compelled to draw off, having lost nigh 100 men, without one gaining a footing upon the walls.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="winning.c23.p80"><s sid="266" id="winning.c23.s266">That evening another council of war was held without.</s> <s sid="267" id="winning.c23.s267">Already some large machines for which Sir Rudolph had sent had arrived.</s> <s sid="268" id="winning.c23.s268">In anticipation of the possibility of failure, two castles upon wheels had been prepared, and between these a huge beam with an iron head was hung.</s> <s sid="269" id="winning.c23.s269">This was upon the following day pushed forward on the newly-formed ground across the moat.</s> <s sid="270" id="winning.c23.s270">Upon the upper part of each tower were armed men who worked machines casting sheaves of arrows and other missiles.</s> <s sid="271" id="winning.c23.s271">Below were those who worked the ram.</s> <s sid="272" id="winning.c23.s272">To each side of the beam were attached numerous cords, and with these it was swung backwards and forwards, giving heavy blows each stroke upon the wall.</s> <s sid="273" id="winning.c23.s273">The machines for casting stones, which had arrived, were also brought in play, and day and night these thundered against the walls; while the ram repeated its ceaseless blows upon the same spot, until the stone crumbled before it.</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="winning.c23.p81"><s sid="274" id="winning.c23.s274">Very valiantly did the garrison oppose themselves to these efforts.</s> <s sid="275" id="winning.c23.s275">But each day showed the progress made by the besiegers.</s> <s sid="276" id="winning.c23.s276">Their forces had been increased, Prince John having ordered his captain at Gloucester to send another 100 men to the assistance of Sir Rudolph.</s> <s sid="277" id="winning.c23.s277">Other towers had now been prepared.</s> <s sid="278" id="winning.c23.s278">These were larger than the first, and overtopped the castle walls.</s> <s sid="279" id="winning.c23.s279">From the upper story were drawbridges, so formed as to drop from the structures upon the walls, and thus enable the besiegers to rush upon them.</s> <s sid="280" id="winning.c23.s280">The process was facilitated by the fact that the battlements had been shot away by the great stones, and there was a clear space on which the drawbridges could fall.</s> <s sid="281" id="winning.c23.s281">The attack was made with great vigour; but for a long time the besieged maintained their post, and drove back the assailants as they poured out across the drawbridges on to the wall.</s> <s sid="282" id="winning.c23.s282">At last Cuthbert saw that the forces opposed to him were too numerous to be resisted, and gave orders to his men to fall back upon the inner keep.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="winning.c23.p82"><s sid="283" id="winning.c23.s283">Making one rush, and clearing the wall of those who had gained a footing, the garrison fell back hastily, and were safely within the massive keep before the enemy had mustered in sufficient numbers upon the wall to interfere with them.</s> <s sid="284" id="winning.c23.s284">The drawbridge was now lowered, and the whole of the assailants gained footing within the castle.</s> <s sid="285" id="winning.c23.s285">They were still far from having achieved a victory.</s> <s sid="286" id="winning.c23.s286">The walls of the keep were massive and strong, and its top far higher than the walls, so that from above a storm of arrows poured down upon all who ventured to show themselves.</s> <s sid="287" id="winning.c23.s287">The keep had no windows low enough down for access to be gained; and those on the floors above were so narrow, and protected by bars, that it seemed by scaling the walls alone could an entry be effected.</s> <s sid="288" id="winning.c23.s288">This was far too desperate an enterprise to be attempted, for the keep rose eighty feet above the courtyard.</s> <s sid="289" id="winning.c23.s289">It was upon the door, solid and studded with iron, that the attempt had to be made.</s> </p>
