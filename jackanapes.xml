<p pid="3" id="jackanapes.c1.p3"><s sid="6" id="jackanapes.c1.s6">Two Donkeys and the Geese lived on the Green, and all other residents of any social standing lived in houses round it.</s> <s sid="7" id="jackanapes.c1.s7">The houses had no names.</s> <s sid="8" id="jackanapes.c1.s8">Everybody's address was, "The Green," but the Postman and the people of the place knew where each family lived.</s> <s sid="9" id="jackanapes.c1.s9">As to the rest of the world, what has one to do with the rest of the world, when he is safe at home on his own Goose Green?</s> <s sid="10" id="jackanapes.c1.s10">Moreover, if a stranger did come on any lawful business, he might ask his way at the shop.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jackanapes.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="jackanapes.c1.s11">Most of the inhabitants were long-lived, early deaths (like that of the little Miss Jessamine) being exceptional; and most of the old people were proud of their age, especially the sexton, who would be ninety-nine come Martinmas, and whose father remembered a man who had carried arrows, as a boy, for the battle of Flodden Field.</s> <s sid="12" id="jackanapes.c1.s12">The Grey Goose and the big Miss Jessamine were the only elderly persons who kept their ages secret.</s> <s sid="13" id="jackanapes.c1.s13">Indeed, Miss Jessamine never mentioned any one's age, or recalled the exact year in which anything had happened.</s> <s sid="14" id="jackanapes.c1.s14">She said that she had been taught that it was bad manners to do so "in a mixed assembly."</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jackanapes.c1.p5"><s sid="15" id="jackanapes.c1.s15">The Grey Goose also avoided dates, but this was partly because her brain, though intelligent, was not mathematical, and computation was beyond her.</s> <s sid="16" id="jackanapes.c1.s16">She never got farther than "last Michaelmas," "the Michaelmas before that," and "the Michaelmas before the Michaelmas before that."</s> <s sid="17" id="jackanapes.c1.s17">After this her head, which was small, became confused, and she said, "Ga, ga!" and changed the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jackanapes.c1.p6"><s sid="18" id="jackanapes.c1.s18">But she remembered the little Miss Jessamine, the Miss Jessamine with the "conspicuous" hair.</s> <s sid="19" id="jackanapes.c1.s19">Her aunt, the big Miss Jessamine, said it was her only fault.</s> <s sid="20" id="jackanapes.c1.s20">The hair was clean, was abundant, was glossy, but do what you would with it, it never looked like other people's.</s> <s sid="21" id="jackanapes.c1.s21">And at church, after Saturday night's wash, it shone like the best brass fender after a Spring cleaning.</s> <s sid="22" id="jackanapes.c1.s22">In short, it was conspicuous, which does not become a young woman--especially in church.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jackanapes.c1.p7"><s sid="23" id="jackanapes.c1.s23">Those were worrying times altogether, and the Green was used for strange purposes.</s> <s sid="24" id="jackanapes.c1.s24">A political meeting was held on it with the village Cobbler in the chair, and a speaker who came by stage coach from the town, where they had wrecked the bakers' shops, and discussed the price of bread.</s> <s sid="25" id="jackanapes.c1.s25">He came a second time, by stage, but the people had heard something about him in the meanwhile, and they did not keep him on the Green.</s> <s sid="26" id="jackanapes.c1.s26">They took him to the pond and tried to make him swim, which he could not do, and the whole affair was very disturbing to all quiet and peaceable fowls.</s> <s sid="27" id="jackanapes.c1.s27">After which another man came, and preached sermons on the Green, and a great many people went to hear him; for those were "trying times," and folk ran hither and thither for comfort.</s> <s sid="28" id="jackanapes.c1.s28">And then what did they do but drill the ploughboys on the Green, to get them ready to fight the French, and teach them the goose-step!</s> <s sid="29" id="jackanapes.c1.s29">However, that came to an end at last, for Bony was sent to St.</s> <s sid="30" id="jackanapes.c1.s30">Helena, and the ploughboys were sent back to the plough.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jackanapes.c1.p8"><s sid="31" id="jackanapes.c1.s31">Everybody lived in fear of Bony in those days, especially the naughty children, who were kept in order during the day by threats of, "Bony shall have you," and who had nightmares about him in the dark.</s> <s sid="32" id="jackanapes.c1.s32">They thought he was an Ogre in a cocked hat.</s> <s sid="33" id="jackanapes.c1.s33">The Grey Goose thought he was a fox, and that all the men of England were going out in red coats to hunt him.</s> <s sid="34" id="jackanapes.c1.s34">It was no use to argue the point, for she had a very small head, and when one idea got into it there was no room for another.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jackanapes.c1.p9"><s sid="35" id="jackanapes.c1.s35">Besides, the Grey Goose never saw Bony, nor did the children, which rather spoilt the terror of him, so that the Black Captain became more effective as a Bogy with hardened offenders.</s> <s sid="36" id="jackanapes.c1.s36">The Grey Goose remembered _his_ coming to the place perfectly.</s> <s sid="37" id="jackanapes.c1.s37">What he came for she did not pretend to know.</s> <s sid="38" id="jackanapes.c1.s38">It was all part and parcel of the war and bad times.</s> <s sid="39" id="jackanapes.c1.s39">He was called the Black Captain, partly because of himself, and partly because of his wonderful black mare.</s> <s sid="40" id="jackanapes.c1.s40">Strange stories were afloat of how far and how fast that mare could go, when her master's hand was on her mane and he whispered in her ear.</s> <s sid="41" id="jackanapes.c1.s41">Indeed, some people thought we might reckon ourselves very lucky if we were not out of the frying-pan into the fire, and had not got a certain well-known Gentleman of the Road to protect us against the French.</s> <s sid="42" id="jackanapes.c1.s42">But that, of course, made him none the less useful to the Johnson's Nurse, when the little Miss Johnsons were naughty.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jackanapes.c1.p10"><s sid="43" id="jackanapes.c1.s43">"You leave off crying this minnit, Miss Jane, or I'll give you right away to that horrid wicked officer.</s> <s sid="44" id="jackanapes.c1.s44">Jemima! just look out o' the windy, if you please, and see if the Black Cap'n's a-com-ing with his horse to carry away Miss Jane."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jackanapes.c1.p11"><s sid="45" id="jackanapes.c1.s45">And there, sure enough, the Black Captain strode by, with his sword clattering as if it did not know whose head to cut off first.</s> <s sid="46" id="jackanapes.c1.s46">But he did not call for Miss Jane that time.</s> <s sid="47" id="jackanapes.c1.s47">He went on to the Green, where he came so suddenly upon the eldest Master Johnson, sitting in a puddle on purpose, in his new nankeen skeleton suit, that the young gentleman thought judgment had overtaken him at last, and abandoned himself to the howlings of despair.</s> <s sid="48" id="jackanapes.c1.s48">His howls were redoubled when he was clutched from behind and swung over the Black Captain's shoulder, but in five minutes his tears were stanched, and he was playing with the officer's accoutrements.</s> <s sid="49" id="jackanapes.c1.s49">All of which the Grey Goose saw with her own eyes, and heard afterwards that that bad boy had been whining to go back to the Black Captain ever since, which showed how hardened he was, and that nobody but Bonaparte himself could be expected to do him any good.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jackanapes.c1.p12"><s sid="50" id="jackanapes.c1.s50">But those were "trying times."</s> <s sid="51" id="jackanapes.c1.s51">It was bad enough when the pickle of a large and respectable family cried for the Black Captain; when it came to the little Miss Jessamine crying for him, one felt that the sooner the French landed and had done with it the better.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jackanapes.c1.p13"><s sid="52" id="jackanapes.c1.s52">The big Miss Jessamine's objection to him was that he was a soldier, and this prejudice was shared by all the Green.</s> <s sid="53" id="jackanapes.c1.s53">"A soldier," as the speaker from the town had observed, "is a bloodthirsty, unsettled sort of a rascal; that the peaceable, home-loving, bread-winning citizen can never conscientiously look on as a brother, till he has beaten his sword into a ploughshare, and his spear into a pruning-hook."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jackanapes.c1.p14"><s sid="54" id="jackanapes.c1.s54">On the other hand there was some truth in what the Postman (an old soldier) said in reply; that the sword has to cut a way for us out of many a scrape into which our bread-winners get us when they drive their ploughshares into fallows that don't belong to them.</s> <s sid="55" id="jackanapes.c1.s55">Indeed, whilst our most peaceful citizens were prosperous chiefly by means of cotton, of sugar, and of the rise and fall of the money-market (not to speak of such salable matters as opium, firearms, and "black ivory"), disturbances were apt to arise in India, Africa and other outlandish parts, where the fathers of our domestic race were making fortunes for their families.</s> <s sid="56" id="jackanapes.c1.s56">And, for that matter, even on the Green, we did not wish the military to leave us in the lurch, so long as there was any fear that the French were coming.[1]</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jackanapes.c1.p15"><s sid="57" id="jackanapes.c1.s57">[Footnote 1:</s> <s sid="58" id="jackanapes.c1.s58">"The political men declare war, and generally for commercial interests; but when the nation is thus embroiled with its neighbors the soldier ... draws the sword, at the command of his country....

<p pid="16" id="jackanapes.c1.p16"><s sid="62" id="jackanapes.c1.s62">To let the Black Captain have little Miss Jessamine, however, was another matter.</s> <s sid="63" id="jackanapes.c1.s63">Her Aunt would not hear of it; and then, to crown all, it appeared that the Captain's father did not think the young lady good enough for his son.</s> <s sid="64" id="jackanapes.c1.s64">Never was any affair more clearly brought to a conclusion.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jackanapes.c1.p17"><s sid="65" id="jackanapes.c1.s65">But those were "trying times;" and one moon-light night, when the Grey Goose was sound asleep upon one leg, the Green was rudely shaken under her by the thud of a horse's feet.</s> <s sid="66" id="jackanapes.c1.s66">"Ga, ga!" said she, putting down the other leg, and running away.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jackanapes.c1.p18"><s sid="67" id="jackanapes.c1.s67">By the time she returned to her place not a thing was to be seen or heard.</s> <s sid="68" id="jackanapes.c1.s68">The horse had passed like a shot.</s> <s sid="69" id="jackanapes.c1.s69">But next day, there was hurrying and skurrying and cackling at a very early hour, all about the white house with the black beams, where Miss Jessamine lived.</s> <s sid="70" id="jackanapes.c1.s70">And when the sun was so low, and the shadows so long on the grass that the Grey Goose felt ready to run away at the sight of her own neck, little Miss Jane Johnson, and her "particular friend" Clarinda, sat under the big oak-tree on the Green, and Jane pinched Clarinda's little finger till she found that she could keep a secret, and then she told her in confidence that she had heard from Nurse and Jemima that Miss Jessamine's niece had been a very naughty girl, and that that horrid wicked officer had come for her on his black horse, and carried her right away.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jackanapes.c1.p22"><s sid="75" id="jackanapes.c1.s75">"Not never no more?" sobbed Clarinda, for she was weak-minded, and could not bear to think that Bony never, never let naughty people go home again.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jackanapes.c1.p23"><s sid="76" id="jackanapes.c1.s76">Next day Jane had heard more.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jackanapes.c6.p3"><s sid="3" id="jackanapes.c6.s3">Jackanapes' death was sad news for the Goose Green, a sorrow justly qualified by honorable pride in his gallantry and devotion.</s> <s sid="4" id="jackanapes.c6.s4">Only the Cobbler dissented, but that was his way.</s> <s sid="5" id="jackanapes.c6.s5">He said he saw nothing in it but foolhardiness and vain-glory.</s> <s sid="6" id="jackanapes.c6.s6">They might both have been killed, as easy as not, and then where would ye have been?</s> <s sid="7" id="jackanapes.c6.s7">A man's life was a man's life, and one life was as good as another.</s> <s sid="8" id="jackanapes.c6.s8">No one would catch him throwing his away.</s> <s sid="9" id="jackanapes.c6.s9">And, for that matter, Mrs. Johnson could spare a child a great deal better than Miss Jessamine.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jackanapes.c6.p4"><s sid="10" id="jackanapes.c6.s10">But the parson preached Jackanapes' funeral sermon on the text, "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it;" and all the village went and wept to hear him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jackanapes.c6.p5"><s sid="11" id="jackanapes.c6.s11">Nor did Miss Jessamine see her loss from the Cobbler's point of view.</s> <s sid="12" id="jackanapes.c6.s12">On the contrary, Mrs. Johnson said she never to her dying day should forget how, when she went to condole with her, the old lady came forward, with gentle-womanly self-control, and kissed her, and thanked GOD that her dear nephew's effort had been blessed with success, and that this sad war had made no gap in her friend's large and happy home circle.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jackanapes.c6.p6"><s sid="13" id="jackanapes.c6.s13">"But she's a noble, unselfish woman," sobbed Mrs. Johnson, "and she taught Jackanapes to be the same, and that's how it is that my Tony has been spared to me.</s> <s sid="14" id="jackanapes.c6.s14">And it must be sheer goodness in Miss Jessamine, for what can she know of a mother's feelings?</s> <s sid="15" id="jackanapes.c6.s15">And I'm sure most people seem to think that if you've a large family you don't know one from another any more than they do, and that a lot of children are like a lot of store-apples, if one's taken it won't be missed."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jackanapes.c6.p7"><s sid="16" id="jackanapes.c6.s16">Lollo--the first Lollo, the Gipsy's Lollo--very aged, draws Miss Jessamine's bath-chair slowly up and down the Goose Green in the sunshine.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jackanapes.c6.p9"><s sid="19" id="jackanapes.c6.s19">In the opinion of the Goose Green, Miss Jessamine has borne her troubles "wonderfully."</s> <s sid="20" id="jackanapes.c6.s20">Indeed, to-day, some of the less delicate and less intimate of those who see everything from the upper windows, say (well behind her back) that "the old lady seems quite lively with her military beaux again."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jackanapes.c6.p10"><s sid="21" id="jackanapes.c6.s21">The meaning of this is, that Captain Johnson is leaning over one side of her chair, whilst by the other bends a brother officer who is staying with him, and who has manifested an extraordinary interest in Lollo.</s> <s sid="22" id="jackanapes.c6.s22">He bends lower and lower, and Miss Jessamine calls to the Postman to request Lollo to be kind enough to stop, whilst she is fumbling for something which always hangs by her side, and has got entangled with her spectacles.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jackanapes.c6.p11"><s sid="23" id="jackanapes.c6.s23">It is a two-penny trumpet, bought years ago in the village fair, and over it she and Captain Johnson tell, as best they can, between them, the story of Jackanapes' ride across the Goose Green; and how he won Lollo--the Gipsy's Lollo--the racer Lollo--dear Lollo--faithful Lollo--Lollo the never vanquished--Lollo the tender servant of his old mistress.</s> <s sid="24" id="jackanapes.c6.s24">And Lollo's ears twitch at every mention of his name.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jackanapes.c6.p12"><s sid="25" id="jackanapes.c6.s25">Their hearer does not speak, but he never moves his eyes from the trumpet, and when the tale is told, he lifts Miss Jessamine's hand and presses his heavy black moustache in silence to her trembling fingers.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jackanapes.c6.p14"><s sid="29" id="jackanapes.c6.s29">And, if the good gossips' eyes do not deceive them, all the Miss Johnsons, and both the officers, go wandering off into the lanes, where bryony wreaths still twine about the brambles.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jackanapes.c6.p20"><s sid="35" id="jackanapes.c6.s35">There is a heritage of heroic example and noble obligation, not reckoned in the Wealth of Nations, but essential to a nation's life; the contempt of which, in any people, may, not slowly, mean even its commercial fall.</s> <s sid="36" id="jackanapes.c6.s36">Very sweet are the uses of prosperity, the harvests of peace and progress, the fostering sunshine of health and happiness, and length of days in the land.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jackanapes.c6.p21"><s sid="37" id="jackanapes.c6.s37">But there be things--oh, sons of what has deserved the name of Great Britain, forget it not!--"the good of" which and "the use of" which are beyond all calculation of worldly goods and earthly uses; things such as Love, and Honor, and the Soul of Man, which cannot be bought with a price, and which do not die with death.</s> <s sid="38" id="jackanapes.c6.s38">And they who would fain live happily EVER after, should not leave these things out of the lessons of their lives.</s> </p>
