<p pid="2" id="leila.c0.p2" type="speech"><s>It was the intention of the writer of the following pages to have bid a last farewell to Leila, but some of her young readers have said <qs/>"No;"<qe/> and she feels too grateful for the kindness they have shown her, not to make the attempt to meet their wishes.</s> <s>Circumstances have so long prevented her fulfilling this intention, that it may be necessary to remind them that they took leave of Leila when she had just set off for Woodlands, (near Richmond,) a property Mr. Howard had purchased near the residence of her uncle, Mr. Stanley; that Leila was in all the joy of her cousin, Selina Stanley, having recovered her speech; that Selina's sister, Matilda, was continuing to make many good resolutions, and too often to break them again; and that their brother, little Alfred, was little Alfred still, and not over wise.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="leila.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="leila.c1.s1">The wooded banks of Richmond were in all the soft green of early spring, when they were first seen by Leila.</s> <s sid="2" id="leila.c1.s2">A few months had passed; the trees were now half stripped of their leaves, and the autumn tints were fast fading into sombre gray as she a second time caught sight of its wooded heights; but how different were now her feelings, how much more beautiful did the whole scene appear to her with Selina by her side!</s> <s sid="3" id="leila.c1.s3">Selina was spring, summer, sunshine, and all to Leila, and she had not a sigh to give to the falling leaves or the moaning wind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="leila.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="leila.c1.s4">As the carriage drew up before the same low, picturesque-looking house, which she had before visited, Matilda and Alfred (who with their papa and mamma had preceded them but a few minutes) stood holding the house-door open, ready to give them welcome.</s> <s sid="5" id="leila.c1.s5">Little Alfred bustled out to assist in letting down the steps, and Matilda, in her eagerness to help them to alight, had well nigh brought them to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="leila.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="leila.c1.s6"><qs/>"Softly, softly,"<qe/> Mr. Howard exclaimed, as he endeavoured to catch hold of Leila's frock; but Matilda had succeeded in extricating both the little girls from the carriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="leila.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="leila.c1.s7"><qs/>"Oh, what a day of joy!"<qe/><sss/> she cried; <sse/><qs/>"Cousin Leila still to be with us for a whole month, and Selina as able to talk to her now as I am; Selina, do you remember when you went away?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="leila.c1.p5"><s sid="8" id="leila.c1.s8">Selina did remember: she coloured, her eyes filled with tears, and throwing her arms first round her sister's neck, and then round Leila's, she darted from their side.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="leila.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="leila.c1.s9"><qs/>"Why does she do that? where has she gone?"<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="leila.c1.s10">Leila anxiously inquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="leila.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="leila.c1.s12">Leila crossed the passage, and softly opened the door; Selina was on her knees by the side of her little bed; she timidly advanced, and lifting the white muslin curtain which partly concealed Selina's slight figure, she knelt by her side.</s> <s sid="13" id="leila.c1.s13">As the two little girls rose from their knees, their eyes met eyes so full of gratitude to heaven, as almost made Selina's half-whispered explanation, <qs/>"Leila, I could not wait till night, unnecessary;"<qe/><sss/> "and now," she continued, <sse/><qs/>"I must go to dear mamma."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="leila.c1.p9"><s sid="14" id="leila.c1.s14">When Selina returned soon after, she found Leila and Matilda, assisted by Amy, arranging the smaller parcels, and carrying them to the different rooms.</s> <s sid="15" id="leila.c1.s15">Matilda looked eagerly in Selina's eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="leila.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="leila.c1.s16"><qs/>"I see what you have been doing,"<qe/> she said, reproachfully:</s> <s sid="17" id="leila.c1.s17"><qs/>"but I think it is I that should cry: when we were here before, I had to speak both for you and myself.</s> <s sid="18" id="leila.c1.s18">Oh, it was so nice; no, no, Selina, I don't mean that, I don't indeed; I am so glad you can speak, oh, so very glad; I said it only to make you laugh, and now I am near crying myself, but I won't; this is not a day to weep, the very happiest day of all our lives.</s> <s sid="19" id="leila.c1.s19">Come, let us go and visit the school-room; not to say lessons, you know, but just to enjoy ourselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="leila.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="leila.c1.s20"><qs/>"Yes, that will be an excellent plan,"<qe/><sss/> Leila answered; <sse/><qs/>"and perhaps in the bread-basket we shall still find the head of the doll, which would have been so pretty a doll for my Sally, if it had not been so hardly dealt with."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="leila.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="leila.c1.s21">Matilda laughed; <qs/>"How funny you are,"<qe/><sls/> she said, turning to Leila, and passing her arm round her waist; <sle/><qs/>"you have put away my sorrow in a minute."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="leila.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="leila.c1.s29"><qs/>"But that is all over now,"<qe/><sss/> Matilda observed; <sse/><qs/>"so we need not speak about it, for now we are all three as happy as can be; don't you think so, Selina?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="leila.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="leila.c1.s30"><qs/>"Indeed I do, Matilda; but it is such a deep joy I cannot find words to utter it; it does not make me merry, but do not think it is because I am sad.</s> <s sid="31" id="leila.c1.s31">If you are happy and think it a joyful day, what must it be to me?</s> <s sid="32" id="leila.c1.s32">I had given up all hope of ever being able to speak again; I was telling Leila so that very day, and making her promise not to pray for it any more.</s> <s sid="33" id="leila.c1.s33">Then so many changes have come upon me.</s> <s sid="34" id="leila.c1.s34">When I saw Leila on the ground, when I thought her dead,--oh, I must not think of it; and when she opened her eyes again, and said, <alt-qs/>'Who spoke? what has happened?'<alt-qe/> and when she knew God had opened my lips, what a moment that was!</s> <s sid="35" id="leila.c1.s35">Leila's joy, and my joy too, and to be able to tell her how much I loved her.</s> <s sid="36" id="leila.c1.s36">You do not know how I used to struggle before, and what it was for me not to be able to speak."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="leila.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="leila.c1.s37"><qs/>"Indeed I do know very well,"<qe/><sss/> Matilda answered; <sse/><qs/>"for when mamma often says to me, <alt-qs/>'Matilda, I must beg you to be silent, you distract my head,'<alt-qe/> I am more anxious to speak than ever; and so vexed, I would rather she had given me a good slap."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="leila.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="leila.c1.s43"><qs/>"I would die,"<qe/> Leila answered, in a voice so low that the words were scarcely audible.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="leila.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="leila.c1.s44">But Matilda caught them.</s> <s sid="45" id="leila.c1.s45"><qs/>"Oh dear,"<qe/><sss/> she cried, <sse/><qs/>"how I have shocked you; what a shocked face you have; well, I am always saying something wrong, and I dare say I shall never be better; for these kind of things come out before I know what I am saying.</s> <s sid="46" id="leila.c1.s46">Selina, do you think it was so very wrong, and was Leila right to say she would----?</s> <s sid="47" id="leila.c1.s47">You know what I mean.</s> <s sid="48" id="leila.c1.s48">You always tell me we should take trials patiently."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="leila.c19.p2" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="leila.c19.s7">Matilda, capering around her at one moment, in the next holding her in her arms, looking into her eyes with tearful joy, and exclaiming,--<qs/>"Your dear one, you more than darling! and with your eyes so bright, so open--only at times the slightest little beautiful droop, just to remind us of what has been.</s> <s sid="8" id="leila.c19.s8">Did I not tell you how it would be? did I not say you would again see better than any of us?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="leila.c19.p3"><s sid="9" id="leila.c19.s9">And Charles, what did he say?</s> <s sid="10" id="leila.c19.s10">_Nothing._ He stood gazing into Leila's eyes as if he could have looked into them for ever, then raising her hand, he pressed it to his lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="leila.c19.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="leila.c19.s11"><qs/>"Charles,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"how strange you are.</s> <s sid="12" id="leila.c19.s12">Amy does that sometimes to me; she says it is from love and respect; it is from love and respect, eh, Charles?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="leila.c19.p5"><s sid="13" id="leila.c19.s13">The happiness of this happy day seemed every hour to increase.</s> <s sid="14" id="leila.c19.s14">In the evening they all walked to the village, and what did Leila see just before entering it?</s> <s sid="15" id="leila.c19.s15">A pretty cottage in a lovely little garden, blooming with flowers, roses and honeysuckles trained on its white walls, a green turf seat by the side of its little porch, and a bee-hive in a sheltered corner.</s> <s sid="16" id="leila.c19.s16">And this was Mr. Howard's glad surprise for Leila; this was a cottage he had directed should be built during their absence for Susan's mother, and in two days, on the first of May, she was to take possession of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="leila.c19.p6"><s sid="17" id="leila.c19.s17">There were others who looked forward to May-day with eager expectation; for an old custom was to be revived, a youthful queen was to be chosen.</s> <s sid="18" id="leila.c19.s18">Leila herself, though at a distance, had for some time been all anxiety on this subject, revolving in her mind the different merits of her little scholars, and scarcely knowing which most to wish should obtain the promised honour.</s> <s sid="19" id="leila.c19.s19">And she had returned to witness this; returned able to _see_ and to enjoy it all.</s> <s sid="20" id="leila.c19.s20">What happiness, what deep gratitude was hers!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="leila.c19.p7"><s sid="21" id="leila.c19.s21">Next day all was joyful bustle and activity.</s> <s sid="22" id="leila.c19.s22">The village children were up with the sun, and while the dew still lay upon the grass, the crystal drops sparkled on every tree and shrub, their merry voices mingled with the song of the skylark, and, like the bee, they were darting from flower to flower, wandering far and wide amidst banks of primroses, lilies of the valley, and dark blue harebells.</s> <s sid="23" id="leila.c19.s23">Long did they pursue their pleasant toil, and in the evening they returned to it again, and not till twilight shades had fallen on the lovely valley, and the silver moon had risen to guide them on their way, were they to be seen trooping homewards, laden with green boughs and heaps of blooming flowers.</s> <s sid="24" id="leila.c19.s24">It was but a short repose that lulled any of them to forgetfulness that night; they were up by the first streak of day to weave the garlands for their youthful queen, and the morning rose fair and bright upon their pleasant labours.</s> <s sid="25" id="leila.c19.s25">Matilda for some time past had been giving them instructions in the art of weaving garlands, and many of them did great credit to their little mistress.</s> <s sid="26" id="leila.c19.s26">She had a few days before constructed for them a crown which they were to imitate, and so well did they now succeed, that it seemed an equal grief to old and young that any thing so beautiful should ever fade.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="leila.c19.p8"><s sid="27" id="leila.c19.s27">Selina had returned to her own home; but it had been arranged that Matilda and she were to be early at Woodlands on May morning, to accompany Leila to the village, that they might all be there when the queen was chosen.</s> <s sid="28" id="leila.c19.s28">Leila's own repose was also somewhat broken on the eve of this eventful day, and having risen early, dressed herself and offered up her prayer and grateful praise, she seated herself at the open window to watch for the expected summons.</s> <s sid="29" id="leila.c19.s29">The morning breeze blew softly on her blooming cheek, her whole heart was full of sweet emotions; again there was joy to her in every rural sight and sound.</s> <s sid="30" id="leila.c19.s30">Often she listened eagerly, and fancied she could hear the joyful hum of many voices from the distant village.</s> <s sid="31" id="leila.c19.s31">Again she listened; was it the sound of distant music she heard?</s> <s sid="32" id="leila.c19.s32">It went, and came again, and she could now hear distinctly a chorus of youthful voices rising on the passing breeze, and could distinguish at intervals, wending their way through the wood, a group of the village children, dressed in white, carrying garlands and green boughs.</s> <s sid="33" id="leila.c19.s33">As they emerged into the open lawn, the group divided, and she saw, surrounded by this youthful band, her beautiful Selim, led by Charles, and followed by Mina, Selina, and Matilda.</s> <s sid="34" id="leila.c19.s34">Selim was decked with flowers, and on the pretty saddle-cloth was placed the crown.</s> <s sid="35" id="leila.c19.s35">They all advanced, still singing; and, in breathless surprise, Leila listened to the following words:--</s> </p>
