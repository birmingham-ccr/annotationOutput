<qe/><title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="twelveyears.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="twelveyears.c1.s1">Having been born a freeman, and for more than thirty years enjoyed the blessings of liberty in a free State--and having at the end of that time been kidnapped and sold into Slavery, where I remained, until happily rescued in the month of January, 1853, after a bondage of twelve years--it has been suggested that an account of my life and fortunes would not be uninteresting to the public.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="twelveyears.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="twelveyears.c1.s2">Since my return to liberty, I have not failed to perceive the increasing interest throughout the Northern States, in regard to the subject of Slavery.</s> <s sid="3" id="twelveyears.c1.s3">Works of fiction, professing to portray its features in their more pleasing as well as more repugnant aspects, have been circulated to an extent unprecedented, and, as I understand, have created a fruitful topic of comment and discussion.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="twelveyears.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="twelveyears.c1.s4">I can speak of Slavery only so far as it came under my own observation--only so far as I have known and experienced it in my own person.</s> <s sid="5" id="twelveyears.c1.s5">My object is, to give a candid and truthful statement of facts: to repeat the story of my life, without exaggeration, leaving it for others to determine, whether even the pages of fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="twelveyears.c1.p4"><s sid="6" id="twelveyears.c1.s6">As far back as I have been able to ascertain, my ancestors on the paternal side were slaves in Rhode Island.</s> <s sid="7" id="twelveyears.c1.s7">They belonged to a family by the name of Northup, one of whom, removing to the State of New-York, settled at Hoosic, in Rensselaer county.</s> <s sid="8" id="twelveyears.c1.s8">He brought with him Mintus Northup, my father.</s> <s sid="9" id="twelveyears.c1.s9">On the death of this gentleman, which must have occurred some fifty years ago, my father became free, having been emancipated by a direction in his will.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="twelveyears.c1.p5"><s sid="10" id="twelveyears.c1.s10">Henry B. Northup, Esq., of Sandy Hill, a distinguished counselor at law, and the man to whom, under Providence, I am indebted for my present liberty, and my return to the society of my wife and children, is a relative of the family in which my forefathers were thus held to service, and from which they took the name I bear.</s> <s sid="11" id="twelveyears.c1.s11">To this fact may be attributed the persevering interest he has taken in my behalf.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="twelveyears.c1.p6"><s sid="12" id="twelveyears.c1.s12">Sometime after my father's liberation, he removed to the town of Minerva, Essex county, N. Y., where I was born, in the month of July, 1808.</s> <s sid="13" id="twelveyears.c1.s13">How long he remained in the latter place I have not the means of definitely ascertaining.</s> <s sid="14" id="twelveyears.c1.s14">From thence he removed to Granville, Washington county, near a place known as Slyborough, where, for some years, he labored on the farm of Clark Northup, also a relative of his old master; from thence he removed to the Alden farm, at Moss Street, a short distance north of the village of Sandy Hill; and from thence to the farm now owned by Russel Pratt, situated on the road leading from Fort Edward to Argyle, where he continued to reside until his death, which took place on the 22d day of November, 1829.</s> <s sid="15" id="twelveyears.c1.s15">He left a widow and two children--myself, and Joseph, an elder brother.</s> <s sid="16" id="twelveyears.c1.s16">The latter is still living in the county of Oswego, near the city of that name; my mother died during the period of my captivity.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="twelveyears.c1.p7"><s sid="17" id="twelveyears.c1.s17">Though born a slave, and laboring under the disadvantages to which my unfortunate race is subjected, my father was a man respected for his industry and integrity, as many now living, who well remember him, are ready to testify.</s> <s sid="18" id="twelveyears.c1.s18">His whole life was passed in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture, never seeking employment in those more menial positions, which seem to be especially allotted to the children of Africa.</s> <s sid="19" id="twelveyears.c1.s19">Besides giving us an education surpassing that ordinarily bestowed upon children in our condition, he acquired, by his diligence and economy, a sufficient property qualification to entitle him to the right of suffrage.</s> <s sid="20" id="twelveyears.c1.s20">He was accustomed to speak to us of his early life; and although at all times cherishing the warmest emotions of kindness, and even of affection towards the family, in whose house he had been a bondsman, he nevertheless comprehended the system of Slavery, and dwelt with sorrow on the degradation of his race.</s> <s sid="21" id="twelveyears.c1.s21">He endeavored to imbue our minds with sentiments of morality, and to teach us to place our trust and confidence in Him who regards the humblest as well as the highest of his creatures.</s> <s sid="22" id="twelveyears.c1.s22">How often since that time has the recollection of his paternal counsels occurred to me, while lying in a slave hut in the distant and sickly regions of Louisiana, smarting with the undeserved wounds which an inhuman master had inflicted, and longing only for the grave which had covered him, to shield me also from the lash of the oppressor.</s> <s sid="23" id="twelveyears.c1.s23">In the church-yard at Sandy Hill, an humble stone marks the spot where he reposes, after having worthily performed the duties appertaining to the lowly sphere wherein God had appointed him to walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="twelveyears.c1.p8"><s sid="24" id="twelveyears.c1.s24">Up to this period I had been principally engaged with my father in the labors of the farm.</s> <s sid="25" id="twelveyears.c1.s25">The leisure hours allowed me were generally either employed over my books, or playing on the violin--an amusement which was the ruling passion of my youth.</s> <s sid="26" id="twelveyears.c1.s26">It has also been the source of consolation since, affording pleasure to the simple beings with whom my lot was cast, and beguiling my own thoughts, for many hours, from the painful contemplation of my fate.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="twelveyears.c1.p9"><s sid="27" id="twelveyears.c1.s27">On Christmas day, 1829, I was married to Anne Hampton, a colored girl then living in the vicinity of our residence.</s> <s sid="28" id="twelveyears.c1.s28">The ceremony was performed at Fort Edward, by Timothy Eddy, Esq., a magistrate of that town, and still a prominent citizen of the place.</s> <s sid="29" id="twelveyears.c1.s29">She had resided a long time at Sandy Hill, with Mr. Baird, proprietor of the Eagle Tavern, and also in the family of Rev.</s> <s sid="30" id="twelveyears.c1.s30">Alexander Proudfit, of Salem.</s> <s sid="31" id="twelveyears.c1.s31">This gentleman for many years had presided over the Presbyterian society at the latter place, and was widely distinguished for his learning and piety.</s> <s sid="32" id="twelveyears.c1.s32">Anne still holds in grateful remembrance the exceeding kindness and the excellent counsels of that good man.</s> <s sid="33" id="twelveyears.c1.s33">She is not able to determine the exact line of her descent, but the blood of three races mingles in her veins.</s> <s sid="34" id="twelveyears.c1.s34">It is difficult to tell whether the red, white, or black predominates.</s> <s sid="35" id="twelveyears.c1.s35">The union of them all, however, in her origin, has given her a singular but pleasing expression, such as is rarely to be seen.</s> <s sid="36" id="twelveyears.c1.s36">Though somewhat resembling, yet she cannot properly be styled a quadroon, a class to which, I have omitted to mention, my mother belonged.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="twelveyears.c1.p10"><s sid="37" id="twelveyears.c1.s37">I had just now passed the period of my minority, having reached the age of twenty-one years in the month of July previous.</s> <s sid="38" id="twelveyears.c1.s38">Deprived of the advice and assistance of my father, with a wife dependent upon me for support, I resolved to enter upon a life of industry; and notwithstanding the obstacle of color, and the consciousness of my lowly state, indulged in pleasant dreams of a good time coming, when the possession of some humble habitation, with a few surrounding acres, should reward my labors, and bring me the means of happiness and comfort.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="twelveyears.c1.p11"><s sid="39" id="twelveyears.c1.s39">From the time of my marriage to this day the love I have borne my wife has been sincere and unabated; and only those who have felt the glowing tenderness a father cherishes for his offspring, can appreciate my affection for the beloved children which have since been born to us.</s> <s sid="40" id="twelveyears.c1.s40">This much I deem appropriate and necessary to say, in order that those who read these pages, may comprehend the poignancy of those sufferings I have been doomed to bear.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="twelveyears.c1.p12"><s sid="41" id="twelveyears.c1.s41">Immediately upon our marriage we commenced house-keeping, in the old yellow building then standing at the southern extremity of Fort Edward village, and which has since been transformed into a modern mansion, and lately occupied by Captain Lathrop.</s> <s sid="42" id="twelveyears.c1.s42">It is known as the Fort House.</s> <s sid="43" id="twelveyears.c1.s43">In this building the courts were sometime held after the organization of the county.</s> <s sid="44" id="twelveyears.c1.s44">It was also occupied by Burgoyne in 1777, being situated near the old Fort on the left bank of the Hudson.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="twelveyears.c1.p13"><s sid="45" id="twelveyears.c1.s45">During the winter I was employed with others repairing the Champlain Canal, on that section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent.</s> <s sid="46" id="twelveyears.c1.s46">David McEachron had the immediate charge of the men in whose company I labored.</s> <s sid="47" id="twelveyears.c1.s47">By the time the canal opened in the spring, I was enabled, from the savings of my wages, to purchase a pair of horses, and other things necessarily required in the business of navigation.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="twelveyears.c1.p14"><s sid="48" id="twelveyears.c1.s48">Having hired several efficient hands to assist me, I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy.</s> <s sid="49" id="twelveyears.c1.s49">Dyer Beckwith and a Mr. Bartemy, of Whitehall, accompanied me on several trips.</s> <s sid="50" id="twelveyears.c1.s50">During the season I became perfectly familiar with the art and mysteries of rafting--a knowledge which afterwards enabled me to render profitable service to a worthy master, and to astonish the simple-witted lumbermen on the banks of the Bayou Boeuf.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="twelveyears.c1.p15"><s sid="51" id="twelveyears.c1.s51">In one of my voyages down Lake Champlain, I was induced to make a visit to Canada.</s> <s sid="52" id="twelveyears.c1.s52">Repairing to Montreal, I visited the cathedral and other places of interest in that city, from whence I continued my excursion to Kingston and other towns, obtaining a knowledge of localities, which was also of service to me afterwards, as will appear towards the close of this narrative.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="twelveyears.c1.p16"><s sid="53" id="twelveyears.c1.s53">Having completed my contracts on the canal satisfactorily to myself and to my employer, and not wishing to remain idle, now that the navigation of the canal was again suspended, I entered into another contract with Medad Gunn, to cut a large quantity of wood.</s> <s sid="54" id="twelveyears.c1.s54">In this business I was engaged during the winter of 1831-32.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="twelveyears.c1.p17"><s sid="55" id="twelveyears.c1.s55">With the return of spring, Anne and myself conceived the project of taking a farm in the neighborhood.</s> <s sid="56" id="twelveyears.c1.s56">I had been accustomed from earliest youth to agricultural labors, and it was an occupation congenial to my tastes.</s> <s sid="57" id="twelveyears.c1.s57">I accordingly entered into arrangements for a part of the old Alden farm, on which my father formerly resided.</s> <s sid="58" id="twelveyears.c1.s58">With one cow, one swine, a yoke of fine oxen I had lately purchased of Lewis Brown, in Hartford, and other personal property and effects, we proceeded to our new home in Kingsbury.</s> <s sid="59" id="twelveyears.c1.s59">That year I planted twenty-five acres of corn, sowed large fields of oats, and commenced farming upon as large a scale as my utmost means would permit.</s> <s sid="60" id="twelveyears.c1.s60">Anne was diligent about the house affairs, while I toiled laboriously in the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="twelveyears.c1.p18"><s sid="61" id="twelveyears.c1.s61">On this place we continued to reside until 1834.</s> <s sid="62" id="twelveyears.c1.s62">In the winter season I had numerous calls to play on the violin.</s> <s sid="63" id="twelveyears.c1.s63">Wherever the young people assembled to dance, I was almost invariably there.</s> <s sid="64" id="twelveyears.c1.s64">Throughout the surrounding villages my fiddle was notorious.</s> <s sid="65" id="twelveyears.c1.s65">Anne, also, during her long residence at the Eagle Tavern, had become somewhat famous as a cook.</s> <s sid="66" id="twelveyears.c1.s66">During court weeks, and on public occasions, she was employed at high wages in the kitchen at Sherrill's Coffee House.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="twelveyears.c1.p19"><s sid="67" id="twelveyears.c1.s67">We always returned home from the performance of these services with money in our pockets; so that, with fiddling, cooking, and farming, we soon found ourselves in the possession of abundance, and, in fact, leading a happy and prosperous life.</s> <s sid="68" id="twelveyears.c1.s68">Well, indeed, would it have been for us had we remained on the farm at Kingsbury; but the time came when the next step was to be taken towards the cruel destiny that awaited me.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="twelveyears.c1.p20"><s sid="69" id="twelveyears.c1.s69">In March, 1834, we removed to Saratoga Springs.</s> <s sid="70" id="twelveyears.c1.s70">We occupied a house belonging to Daniel O'Brien, on the north side of Washington street.</s> <s sid="71" id="twelveyears.c1.s71">At that time Isaac Taylor kept a large boarding house, known as Washington Hall, at the north end of Broadway.</s> <s sid="72" id="twelveyears.c1.s72">He employed me to drive a hack, in which capacity I worked for him two years.</s> <s sid="73" id="twelveyears.c1.s73">After this time I was generally employed through the visiting season, as also was Anne, in the United States Hotel, and other public houses of the place.</s> <s sid="74" id="twelveyears.c1.s74">In winter seasons I relied upon my violin, though during the construction of the Troy and Saratoga railroad, I performed many hard days' labor upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="twelveyears.c1.p21"><s sid="75" id="twelveyears.c1.s75">I was in the habit, at Saratoga, of purchasing articles necessary for my family at the stores of Mr. Cephas Parker and Mr. William Perry, gentlemen towards whom, for many acts of kindness, I entertained feelings of strong regard.</s> <s sid="76" id="twelveyears.c1.s76">It was for this reason that, twelve years afterwards, I caused to be directed to them the letter, which is hereinafter inserted, and which was the means, in the hands of Mr. Northup, of my fortunate deliverance.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="twelveyears.c1.p22"><s sid="77" id="twelveyears.c1.s77">While living at the United States Hotel, I frequently met with slaves, who had accompanied their masters from the South.</s> <s sid="78" id="twelveyears.c1.s78">They were always well dressed and well provided for, leading apparently an easy life, with but few of its ordinary troubles to perplex them.</s> <s sid="79" id="twelveyears.c1.s79">Many times they entered into conversation with me on the subject of Slavery.</s> <s sid="80" id="twelveyears.c1.s80">Almost uniformly I found they cherished a secret desire for liberty.</s> <s sid="81" id="twelveyears.c1.s81">Some of them expressed the most ardent anxiety to escape, and consulted me on the best method of effecting it.</s> <s sid="82" id="twelveyears.c1.s82">The fear of punishment, however, which they knew was certain to attend their re-capture and return, in all cases proved sufficient to deter them from the experiment.</s> <s sid="83" id="twelveyears.c1.s83">Having all my life breathed the free air of the North, and conscious that I possessed the same feelings and affections that find a place in the white man's breast; conscious, moreover, of an intelligence equal to that of some men, at least, with a fairer skin, I was too ignorant, perhaps too independent, to conceive how any one could be content to live in the abject condition of a slave.</s> <s sid="84" id="twelveyears.c1.s84">I could not comprehend the justice of that law, or that religion, which upholds or recognizes the principle of Slavery; and never once, I am proud to say, did I fail to counsel any one who came to me, to watch his opportunity, and strike for freedom.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="twelveyears.c1.p23"><s sid="85" id="twelveyears.c1.s85">I continued to reside at Saratoga until the spring of 1841.</s> <s sid="86" id="twelveyears.c1.s86">The flattering anticipations which, seven years before, had seduced us from the quiet farm-house, on the east side of the Hudson, had not been realized.</s> <s sid="87" id="twelveyears.c1.s87">Though always in comfortable circumstances, we had not prospered.</s> <s sid="88" id="twelveyears.c1.s88">The society and associations at that world-renowned watering place, were not calculated to preserve the simple habits of industry and economy to which I had been accustomed, but, on the contrary, to substitute others in their stead, tending to shiftlessness and extravagance.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="twelveyears.c1.p24"><s sid="89" id="twelveyears.c1.s89">At this time we were the parents of three children--Elizabeth, Margaret, and Alonzo.</s> <s sid="90" id="twelveyears.c1.s90">Elizabeth, the eldest, was in her tenth year; Margaret was two years younger, and little Alonzo had just passed his fifth birth-day.</s> <s sid="91" id="twelveyears.c1.s91">They filled our house with gladness.</s> <s sid="92" id="twelveyears.c1.s92">Their young voices were music in our ears.</s> <s sid="93" id="twelveyears.c1.s93">Many an airy castle did their mother and myself build for the little innocents.</s> <s sid="94" id="twelveyears.c1.s94">When not at labor I was always walking with them, clad in their best attire, through the streets and groves of Saratoga.</s> <s sid="95" id="twelveyears.c1.s95">Their presence was my delight; and I clasped them to my bosom with as warm and tender love as if their clouded skins had been as white as snow.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="twelveyears.c1.p25"><s sid="96" id="twelveyears.c1.s96">Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual--nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world.</s> <s sid="97" id="twelveyears.c1.s97">But now I had reached a turning point in my existence--reached the threshold of unutterable wrong, and sorrow, and despair.</s> <s sid="98" id="twelveyears.c1.s98">Now had I approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="twelveyears.c4.p3"><s sid="22" id="twelveyears.c4.s22">It was a dark night.</s> <s sid="23" id="twelveyears.c4.s23">All was quiet.</s> <s sid="24" id="twelveyears.c4.s24">I could see lights, or the reflection of them, over towards Pennsylvania Avenue, but there was no one, not even a straggler, to be seen.</s> <s sid="25" id="twelveyears.c4.s25">I was almost resolved to attempt to break away.</s> <s sid="26" id="twelveyears.c4.s26">Had I not been hand-cuffed the attempt would certainly have been made, whatever consequence might have followed.</s> <s sid="27" id="twelveyears.c4.s27">Radburn was in the rear, carrying a large stick, and hurrying up the children as fast as the little ones could walk.</s> <s sid="28" id="twelveyears.c4.s28">So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington--through the Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told, rests on the foundation of man's inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!</s> <s sid="29" id="twelveyears.c4.s29">Hail!</s> <s sid="30" id="twelveyears.c4.s30">Columbia, happy land, indeed!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="twelveyears.c4.p4"><s sid="31" id="twelveyears.c4.s31">Reaching the steamboat, we were quickly hustled into the hold, among barrels and boxes of freight.</s> <s sid="32" id="twelveyears.c4.s32">A colored servant brought a light, the bell rung, and soon the vessel started down the Potomac, carrying us we knew not where.</s> <s sid="33" id="twelveyears.c4.s33">The bell tolled as we passed the tomb of Washington!</s> <s sid="34" id="twelveyears.c4.s34">Burch, no doubt, with uncovered head, bowed reverently before the sacred ashes of the man who devoted his illustrious life to the liberty of his country.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="twelveyears.c4.p6"><s sid="44" id="twelveyears.c4.s44">After sunrise in the morning we were called up on deck to breakfast.</s> <s sid="45" id="twelveyears.c4.s45">Burch took our hand-cuffs off, and we sat down to table.</s> <s sid="46" id="twelveyears.c4.s46">He asked Eliza if she would take a dram.</s> <s sid="47" id="twelveyears.c4.s47">She declined, thanking him politely.</s> <s sid="48" id="twelveyears.c4.s48">During the meal we were all silent--not a word passed between us.</s> <s sid="49" id="twelveyears.c4.s49">A mulatto woman who served at table seemed to take an interest in our behalf--told us to cheer up, and not to be so cast down.</s> <s sid="50" id="twelveyears.c4.s50">Breakfast over, the hand-cuffs were restored, and Burch ordered us out on the stern deck.</s> <s sid="51" id="twelveyears.c4.s51">We sat down together on some boxes, still saying nothing in Burch's presence.</s> <s sid="52" id="twelveyears.c4.s52">Occasionally a passenger would walk out to where we were, look at us for a while, then silently return.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="twelveyears.c4.p7"><s sid="53" id="twelveyears.c4.s53">It was a very pleasant morning.</s> <s sid="54" id="twelveyears.c4.s54">The fields along the river were covered with verdure, far in advance of what I had been accustomed to see at that season of the year.</s> <s sid="55" id="twelveyears.c4.s55">The sun shone out warmly; the birds were singing in the trees.</s> <s sid="56" id="twelveyears.c4.s56">The happy birds--I envied them.</s> <s sid="57" id="twelveyears.c4.s57">I wished for wings like them, that I might cleave the air to where my birdlings waited vainly for their father's coming, in the cooler region of the North.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="twelveyears.c4.p8"><s sid="58" id="twelveyears.c4.s58">In the forenoon the steamer reached Aquia Creek.</s> <s sid="59" id="twelveyears.c4.s59">There the passengers took stages--Burch and his five slaves occupying one exclusively.</s> <s sid="60" id="twelveyears.c4.s60">He laughed with the children, and at one stopping place went so far as to purchase them a piece of gingerbread.</s> <s sid="61" id="twelveyears.c4.s61">He told me to hold up my head and look smart.</s> <s sid="62" id="twelveyears.c4.s62">That I might, perhaps, get a good master if I behaved myself.</s> <s sid="63" id="twelveyears.c4.s63">I made him no reply.</s> <s sid="64" id="twelveyears.c4.s64">His face was hateful to me, and I could not bear to look upon it.</s> <s sid="65" id="twelveyears.c4.s65">I sat in the corner, cherishing in my heart the hope, not yet extinct, of some day meeting the tyrant on the soil of my native State.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="twelveyears.c4.p9"><s sid="66" id="twelveyears.c4.s66">At Fredericksburgh we were transferred from the stage coach to a car, and before dark arrived in Richmond, the chief city of Virginia.</s> <s sid="67" id="twelveyears.c4.s67">At this city we were taken from the cars, and driven through the street to a slave pen, between the railroad depot and the river, kept by a Mr. Goodin.</s> <s sid="68" id="twelveyears.c4.s68">This pen is similar to Williams' in Washington, except it is somewhat larger; and besides, there were two small houses standing at opposite corners within the yard.</s> <s sid="69" id="twelveyears.c4.s69">These houses are usually found within slave yards, being used as rooms for the examination of human chattels by purchasers before concluding a bargain.</s> <s sid="70" id="twelveyears.c4.s70">Unsoundness in a slave, as well as in a horse, detracts materially from his value.</s> <s sid="71" id="twelveyears.c4.s71">If no warranty is given, a close examination is a matter of particular importance to the negro jockey.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="twelveyears.c4.p10"><s sid="72" id="twelveyears.c4.s72">We were met at the door of Goodin's yard by that gentleman himself--a short, fat man, with a round, plump face, black hair and whiskers, and a complexion almost as dark as some of his own negroes.</s> <s sid="73" id="twelveyears.c4.s73">He had a hard, stern look, and was perhaps about fifty years of age.</s> <s sid="74" id="twelveyears.c4.s74">Burch and he met with great cordiality.</s> <s sid="75" id="twelveyears.c4.s75">They were evidently old friends.</s> <s sid="76" id="twelveyears.c4.s76">Shaking each other warmly by the hand, Burch remarked he had brought some company, inquired at what time the brig would leave, and was answered that it would probably leave the next day at such an hour.</s> <s sid="77" id="twelveyears.c4.s77">Goodin then turned to me, took hold of my arm, turned me partly round, looked at me sharply with the air of one who considered himself a good judge of property, and as if estimating in his own mind about how much I was worth.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="twelveyears.c4.p11" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="twelveyears.c4.s78"><qs/>"Well, boy, where did you come from?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="twelveyears.c4.p12" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="twelveyears.c4.s79">Forgetting myself, for a moment, I answered, <qs/>"From New-York."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="twelveyears.c4.p13" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="twelveyears.c4.s80"><qs/>"New-York!</s> <s sid="81" id="twelveyears.c4.s81">H--l! what have you been doing up there?"<qe/> was his astonished interrogatory.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="twelveyears.c4.p14" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="twelveyears.c4.s82">Observing Burch at this moment looking at me with an angry expression that conveyed a meaning it was not difficult to understand, I immediately said, <qs/>"O, I have only been up that way a piece,"<qe/> in a manner intended to imply that although I might have been as far as New-York, yet I wished it distinctly understood that I did not belong to that free State, nor to any other.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="twelveyears.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="twelveyears.c4.s83">Goodin then turned to Clem, and then to Eliza and the children, examining them severally, and asking various questions.</s> <s sid="84" id="twelveyears.c4.s84">He was pleased with Emily, as was every one who saw the child's sweet countenance.</s> <s sid="85" id="twelveyears.c4.s85">She was not as tidy as when I first beheld her; her hair was now somewhat disheveled; but through its unkempt and soft profusion there still beamed a little face of most surpassing loveliness.</s> <s sid="86" id="twelveyears.c4.s86"><qs/>"Altogether we were a fair lot--a devilish good lot,"<qe/> he said, enforcing that opinion with more than one emphatic adjective not found in the Christian vocabulary.</s> <s sid="87" id="twelveyears.c4.s87">Thereupon we passed into the yard.</s> <s sid="88" id="twelveyears.c4.s88">Quite a number of slaves, as many as thirty I should say, were moving about, or sitting on benches under the shed.</s> <s sid="89" id="twelveyears.c4.s89">They were all cleanly dressed--the men with hats, the women with handkerchiefs tied about their heads.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="twelveyears.c4.p16"><s sid="90" id="twelveyears.c4.s90">Burch and Goodin, after separating from us, walked up the steps at the back part of the main building, and sat down upon the door sill.</s> <s sid="91" id="twelveyears.c4.s91">They entered into conversation, but the subject of it I could not hear.</s> <s sid="92" id="twelveyears.c4.s92">Presently Burch came down into the yard, unfettered me, and led me into one of the small houses.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="twelveyears.c4.p17" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="twelveyears.c4.s93"><qs/>"You told that man you came from New-York,"<qe/> said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="twelveyears.c4.p18" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="twelveyears.c4.s94">I replied, <qs/>"I told him I had been up as far as New-York, to be sure, but did not tell him I belonged there, nor that I was a freeman.</s> <s sid="95" id="twelveyears.c4.s95">I meant no harm at all, Master Burch.</s> <s sid="96" id="twelveyears.c4.s96">I would not have said it had I thought."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="twelveyears.c4.p19" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="twelveyears.c4.s97">He looked at me a moment as if he was ready to devour me, then turning round went out.</s> <s sid="98" id="twelveyears.c4.s98">In a few minutes he returned.</s> <s sid="99" id="twelveyears.c4.s99"><qs/>"If ever I hear you say a word about New-York, or about your freedom, I will be the death of you--I will kill you; you may rely on that,"<qe/> he ejaculated fiercely.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="twelveyears.c4.p20"><s sid="100" id="twelveyears.c4.s100">I doubt not he understood then better than I did, the danger and the penalty of selling a free man into slavery.</s> <s sid="101" id="twelveyears.c4.s101">He felt the necessity of closing my mouth against the crime he knew he was committing.</s> <s sid="102" id="twelveyears.c4.s102">Of course, my life would not have weighed a feather, in any emergency requiring such a sacrifice.</s> <s sid="103" id="twelveyears.c4.s103">Undoubtedly, he meant precisely what he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="twelveyears.c4.p21"><s sid="104" id="twelveyears.c4.s104">Under the shed on one side of the yard, there was constructed a rough table, while overhead were sleeping lofts--the same as in the pen at Washington.</s> <s sid="105" id="twelveyears.c4.s105">After partaking at this table of our supper of pork and bread, I was hand-cuffed to a large yellow man, quite stout and fleshy, with a countenance expressive of the utmost melancholy.</s> <s sid="106" id="twelveyears.c4.s106">He was a man of intelligence and information.</s> <s sid="107" id="twelveyears.c4.s107">Chained together, it was not long before we became acquainted with each other's history.</s> <s sid="108" id="twelveyears.c4.s108">His name was Robert.</s> <s sid="109" id="twelveyears.c4.s109">Like myself, he had been born free, and had a wife and two children in Cincinnati.</s> <s sid="110" id="twelveyears.c4.s110">He said he had come south with two men, who had hired him in the city of his residence.</s> <s sid="111" id="twelveyears.c4.s111">Without free papers, he had been seized at Fredericksburgh, placed in confinement, and beaten until he had learned, as I had, the necessity and the policy of silence.</s> <s sid="112" id="twelveyears.c4.s112">He had been in Goodin's pen about three weeks.</s> <s sid="113" id="twelveyears.c4.s113">To this man I became much attached.</s> <s sid="114" id="twelveyears.c4.s114">We could sympathize with, and understand each other.</s> <s sid="115" id="twelveyears.c4.s115">It was with tears and a heavy heart, not many days subsequently, that I saw him die, and looked for the last time upon his lifeless form!</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="twelveyears.c4.p22"><s sid="116" id="twelveyears.c4.s116">Robert and myself, with Clem, Eliza and her children, slept that night upon our blankets, in one of the small houses in the yard.</s> <s sid="117" id="twelveyears.c4.s117">There were four others, all from the same plantation, who had been sold, and were now on their way south, who also occupied it with us.</s> <s sid="118" id="twelveyears.c4.s118">David and his wife, Caroline, both mulattoes, were exceedingly affected.</s> <s sid="119" id="twelveyears.c4.s119">They dreaded the thought of being put into the cane and cotton fields; but their greatest source of anxiety was the apprehension of being separated.</s> <s sid="120" id="twelveyears.c4.s120">Mary, a tall, lithe girl, of a most jetty black, was listless and apparently indifferent.</s> <s sid="121" id="twelveyears.c4.s121">Like many of the class, she scarcely knew there was such a word as freedom.</s> <s sid="122" id="twelveyears.c4.s122">Brought up in the ignorance of a brute, she possessed but little more than a brute's intelligence.</s> <s sid="123" id="twelveyears.c4.s123">She was one of those, and there are very many, who fear nothing but their master's lash, and know no further duty than to obey his voice.</s> <s sid="124" id="twelveyears.c4.s124">The other was Lethe.</s> <s sid="125" id="twelveyears.c4.s125">She was of an entirely different character.</s> <s sid="126" id="twelveyears.c4.s126">She had long, straight hair, and bore more the appearance of an Indian than a negro woman.</s> <s sid="127" id="twelveyears.c4.s127">She had sharp and spiteful eyes, and continually gave utterance to the language of hatred and revenge.</s> <s sid="128" id="twelveyears.c4.s128">Her husband had been sold.</s> <s sid="129" id="twelveyears.c4.s129">She knew not where she was.</s> <s sid="130" id="twelveyears.c4.s130">An exchange of masters, she was sure, could not be for the worse.</s> <s sid="131" id="twelveyears.c4.s131">She cared not whither they might carry her.</s> <s sid="132" id="twelveyears.c4.s132">Pointing to the scars upon her face, the desperate creature wished that she might see the day when she could wipe them off in some man's blood!</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="twelveyears.c4.p24"><s sid="135" id="twelveyears.c4.s135">In the morning, having swept the yard, and washed ourselves, under Goodin's superintendence, we were ordered to roll up our blankets, and make ready for the continuance of our journey.</s> <s sid="136" id="twelveyears.c4.s136">Clem Ray was informed that he would go no further, Burch, for some cause, having concluded to carry him back to Washington.</s> <s sid="137" id="twelveyears.c4.s137">He was much rejoiced.</s> <s sid="138" id="twelveyears.c4.s138">Shaking hands, we parted in the slave pen at Richmond, and I have not seen him since.</s> <s sid="139" id="twelveyears.c4.s139">But, much to my surprise, since my return, I learned that he had escaped from bondage, and on his way to the free soil of Canada, lodged one night at the house of my brother-in-law in Saratoga, informing my family of the place and the condition in which he left me.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="twelveyears.c5.p2"><s sid="10" id="twelveyears.c5.s10">But the most prominent of the four, was a man named Arthur.</s> <s sid="11" id="twelveyears.c5.s11">As the lighter approached, he struggled stoutly with his keepers.</s> <s sid="12" id="twelveyears.c5.s12">It was with main force that he was dragged aboard the brig.</s> <s sid="13" id="twelveyears.c5.s13">He protested, in a loud voice, against the treatment he was receiving, and demanded to be released.</s> <s sid="14" id="twelveyears.c5.s14">His face was swollen, and covered with wounds and bruises, and, indeed, one side of it was a complete raw sore.</s> <s sid="15" id="twelveyears.c5.s15">He was forced, with all haste, down the hatchway into the hold.</s> <s sid="16" id="twelveyears.c5.s16">I caught an outline of his story as he was borne struggling along, of which he afterwards gave me a more full relation, and it was as follows:</s> <s sid="17" id="twelveyears.c5.s17">He had long resided in the city of Norfolk, and was a free man.</s> <s sid="18" id="twelveyears.c5.s18">He had a family living there, and was a mason by trade.</s> <s sid="19" id="twelveyears.c5.s19">Having been unusually detained, he was returning late one night to his house in the suburbs of the city, when he was attacked by a gang of persons in an unfrequented street.</s> <s sid="20" id="twelveyears.c5.s20">He fought until his strength failed him.</s> <s sid="21" id="twelveyears.c5.s21">Overpowered at last, he was gagged and bound with ropes, and beaten, until he became insensible.</s> <s sid="22" id="twelveyears.c5.s22">For several days they secreted him in the slave pen at Norfolk--a very common establishment, it appears, in the cities of the South.</s> <s sid="23" id="twelveyears.c5.s23">The night before, he had been taken out and put on board the lighter, which, pushing out from shore, had awaited our arrival.</s> <s sid="24" id="twelveyears.c5.s24">For some time he continued his protestations, and was altogether irreconcilable.</s> <s sid="25" id="twelveyears.c5.s25">At length, however, he became silent.</s> <s sid="26" id="twelveyears.c5.s26">He sank into a gloomy and thoughtful mood, and appeared to be counseling with himself.</s> <s sid="27" id="twelveyears.c5.s27">There was in the man's determined face, something that suggested the thought of desperation.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="twelveyears.c5.p3"><s sid="28" id="twelveyears.c5.s28">After leaving Norfolk the hand-cuffs were taken off, and during the day we were allowed to remain on deck.</s> <s sid="29" id="twelveyears.c5.s29">The captain selected Robert as his waiter, and I was appointed to superintend the cooking department, and the distribution of food and water.</s> <s sid="30" id="twelveyears.c5.s30">I had three assistants, Jim, Cuffee and Jenny.</s> <s sid="31" id="twelveyears.c5.s31">Jenny's business was to prepare the coffee, which consisted of corn meal scorched in a kettle, boiled and sweetened with molasses.</s> <s sid="32" id="twelveyears.c5.s32">Jim and Cuffee baked the hoe-cake and boiled the bacon.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="twelveyears.c5.p4"><s sid="33" id="twelveyears.c5.s33">Standing by a table, formed of a wide board resting on the heads of the barrels, I cut and handed to each a slice of meat and a "dodger" of the bread, and from Jenny's kettle also dipped out for each a cup of the coffee.</s> <s sid="34" id="twelveyears.c5.s34">The use of plates was dispensed with, and their sable fingers took the place of knives and forks.</s> <s sid="35" id="twelveyears.c5.s35">Jim and Cuffee were very demure and attentive to business, somewhat inflated with their situation as second cooks, and without doubt feeling that there was a great responsibility resting on them.</s> <s sid="36" id="twelveyears.c5.s36">I was called steward--a name given me by the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="twelveyears.c5.p5"><s sid="37" id="twelveyears.c5.s37">The slaves were fed twice a day, at ten and five o'clock--always receiving the same kind and quantity of fare, and in the same manner as above described.</s> <s sid="38" id="twelveyears.c5.s38">At night we were driven into the hold, and securely fastened down.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="twelveyears.c5.p6"><s sid="39" id="twelveyears.c5.s39">Scarcely were we out of sight of land before we were overtaken by a violent storm.</s> <s sid="40" id="twelveyears.c5.s40">The brig rolled and plunged until we feared she would go down.</s> <s sid="41" id="twelveyears.c5.s41">Some were sea-sick, others on their knees praying, while some were fast holding to each other, paralyzed with fear.</s> <s sid="42" id="twelveyears.c5.s42">The sea-sickness rendered the place of our confinement loathsome and disgusting.</s> <s sid="43" id="twelveyears.c5.s43">It would have been a happy thing for most of us--it would have saved the agony of many hundred lashes, and miserable deaths at last--had the compassionate sea snatched us that day from the clutches of remorseless men.</s> <s sid="44" id="twelveyears.c5.s44">The thought of Randall and little Emmy sinking down among the monsters of the deep, is a more pleasant contemplation than to think of them as they are now, perhaps, dragging out lives of unrequited toil.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="twelveyears.c5.p7"><s sid="45" id="twelveyears.c5.s45">When in sight of the Bahama Banks, at a place called Old Point Compass, or the Hole in the Wall, we were becalmed three days.</s> <s sid="46" id="twelveyears.c5.s46">There was scarcely a breath of air.</s> <s sid="47" id="twelveyears.c5.s47">The waters of the gulf presented a singularly white appearance, like lime water.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="twelveyears.c5.p8"><s sid="48" id="twelveyears.c5.s48">In the order of events, I come now to the relation of an occurrence, which I never call to mind but with sensations of regret.</s> <s sid="49" id="twelveyears.c5.s49">I thank God, who has since permitted me to escape from the thralldom of slavery, that through his merciful interposition I was prevented from imbruing my hands in the blood of his creatures.</s> <s sid="50" id="twelveyears.c5.s50">Let not those who have never been placed in like circumstances, judge me harshly.</s> <s sid="51" id="twelveyears.c5.s51">Until they have been chained and beaten--until they find themselves in the situation I was, borne away from home and family towards a land of bondage--let them refrain from saying what they would not do for liberty.</s> <s sid="52" id="twelveyears.c5.s52">How far I should have been justified in the sight of God and man, it is unnecessary now to speculate upon.</s> <s sid="53" id="twelveyears.c5.s53">It is enough to say that I am able to congratulate myself upon the harmless termination of an affair which threatened, for a time, to be attended with serious results.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="twelveyears.c5.p9"><s sid="54" id="twelveyears.c5.s54">Towards evening, on the first day of the calm, Arthur and myself were in the bow of the vessel, seated on the windlass.</s> <s sid="55" id="twelveyears.c5.s55">We were conversing together of the probable destiny that awaited us, and mourning together over our misfortunes.</s> <s sid="56" id="twelveyears.c5.s56">Arthur said, and I agreed with him, that death was far less terrible than the living prospect that was before us.</s> <s sid="57" id="twelveyears.c5.s57">For a long time we talked of our children, our past lives, and of the probabilities of escape.</s> <s sid="58" id="twelveyears.c5.s58">Obtaining possession of the brig was suggested by one of us.</s> <s sid="59" id="twelveyears.c5.s59">We discussed the possibility of our being able, in such an event, to make our way to the harbor of New-York.</s> <s sid="60" id="twelveyears.c5.s60">I knew little of the compass; but the idea of risking the experiment was eagerly entertained.</s> <s sid="61" id="twelveyears.c5.s61">The chances, for and against us, in an encounter with the crew, was canvassed.</s> <s sid="62" id="twelveyears.c5.s62">Who could be relied upon, and who could not, the proper time and manner of the attack, were all talked over and over again.</s> <s sid="63" id="twelveyears.c5.s63">From the moment the plot suggested itself I began to hope.</s> <s sid="64" id="twelveyears.c5.s64">I revolved it constantly in my mind.</s> <s sid="65" id="twelveyears.c5.s65">As difficulty after difficulty arose, some ready conceit was at hand, demonstrating how it could be overcome.</s> <s sid="66" id="twelveyears.c5.s66">While others slept, Arthur and I were maturing our plans.</s> <s sid="67" id="twelveyears.c5.s67">At length, with much caution, Robert was gradually made acquainted with our intentions.</s> <s sid="68" id="twelveyears.c5.s68">He approved of them at once, and entered into the conspiracy with a zealous spirit.</s> <s sid="69" id="twelveyears.c5.s69">There was not another slave we dared to trust.</s> <s sid="70" id="twelveyears.c5.s70">Brought up in fear and ignorance as they are, it can scarcely be conceived how servilely they will cringe before a white man's look.</s> <s sid="71" id="twelveyears.c5.s71">It was not safe to deposit so bold a secret with any of them, and finally we three resolved to take upon ourselves alone the fearful responsibility of the attempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="twelveyears.c5.p10"><s sid="72" id="twelveyears.c5.s72">At night, as has been said, we were driven into the hold, and the hatch barred down.</s> <s sid="73" id="twelveyears.c5.s73">How to reach the deck was the first difficulty that presented itself.</s> <s sid="74" id="twelveyears.c5.s74">On the bow of the brig, however, I had observed the small boat lying bottom upwards.</s> <s sid="75" id="twelveyears.c5.s75">It occurred to me that by secreting ourselves underneath it, we would not be missed from the crowd, as they were hurried down into the hold at night.</s> <s sid="76" id="twelveyears.c5.s76">I was selected to make the experiment, in order to satisfy ourselves of its feasibility.</s> <s sid="77" id="twelveyears.c5.s77">The next evening, accordingly, after supper, watching my opportunity, I hastily concealed myself beneath it.</s> <s sid="78" id="twelveyears.c5.s78">Lying close upon the deck, I could see what was going on around me, while wholly unperceived myself.</s> <s sid="79" id="twelveyears.c5.s79">In the morning, as they came up, I slipped from my hiding place without being observed.</s> <s sid="80" id="twelveyears.c5.s80">The result was entirely satisfactory.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="twelveyears.c5.p11"><s sid="81" id="twelveyears.c5.s81">The captain and mate slept in the cabin of the former.</s> <s sid="82" id="twelveyears.c5.s82">From Robert, who had frequent occasion, in his capacity of waiter, to make observations in that quarter, we ascertained the exact position of their respective berths.</s> <s sid="83" id="twelveyears.c5.s83">He further informed us that there were always two pistols and a cutlass lying on the table.</s> <s sid="84" id="twelveyears.c5.s84">The crew's cook slept in the cook galley on deck, a sort of vehicle on wheels, that could be moved about as convenience required, while the sailors, numbering only six, either slept in the forecastle, or in hammocks swung among the rigging.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="twelveyears.c5.p12"><s sid="85" id="twelveyears.c5.s85">Finally our arrangements were all completed.</s> <s sid="86" id="twelveyears.c5.s86">Arthur and I were to steal silently to the captain's cabin, seize the pistols and cutlass, and as quickly as possible despatch him and the mate.</s> <s sid="87" id="twelveyears.c5.s87">Robert, with a club, was to stand by the door leading from the deck down into the cabin, and, in case of necessity, beat back the sailors, until we could hurry to his assistance.</s> <s sid="88" id="twelveyears.c5.s88">We were to proceed then as circumstances might require.</s> <s sid="89" id="twelveyears.c5.s89">Should the attack be so sudden and successful as to prevent resistance, the hatch was to remain barred down; otherwise the slaves were to be called up, and in the crowd, and hurry, and confusion of the time, we resolved to regain our liberty or lose our lives.</s> <s sid="90" id="twelveyears.c5.s90">I was then to assume the unaccustomed place of pilot, and, steering northward, we trusted that some lucky wind might bear us to the soil of freedom.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="twelveyears.c5.p13"><s sid="91" id="twelveyears.c5.s91">The mate's name was Biddee, the captain's I cannot now recall, though I rarely ever forget a name once heard.</s> <s sid="92" id="twelveyears.c5.s92">The captain was a small, genteel man, erect and prompt, with a proud bearing, and looked the personification of courage.</s> <s sid="93" id="twelveyears.c5.s93">If he is still living, and these pages should chance to meet his eye, he will learn a fact connected with the voyage of the brig, from Richmond to New-Orleans, in 1841, not entered on his log-book.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="twelveyears.c5.p14"><s sid="94" id="twelveyears.c5.s94">We were all prepared, and impatiently waiting an opportunity of putting our designs into execution, when they were frustrated by a sad and unforeseen event.</s> <s sid="95" id="twelveyears.c5.s95">Robert was taken ill. It was soon announced that he had the small-pox.</s> <s sid="96" id="twelveyears.c5.s96">He continued to grow worse, and four days previous to our arrival in New-Orleans he died.</s> <s sid="97" id="twelveyears.c5.s97">One of the sailors sewed him in his blanket, with a large stone from the ballast at his feet, and then laying him on a hatchway, and elevating it with tackles above the railing, the inanimate body of poor Robert was consigned to the white waters of the gulf.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="twelveyears.c5.p15"><s sid="98" id="twelveyears.c5.s98">We were all panic-stricken by the appearance of the small-pox.</s> <s sid="99" id="twelveyears.c5.s99">The captain ordered lime to be scattered through the hold, and other prudent precautions to be taken.</s> <s sid="100" id="twelveyears.c5.s100">The death of Robert, however, and the presence of the malady, oppressed me sadly, and I gazed out over the great waste of waters with a spirit that was indeed disconsolate.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="twelveyears.c5.p16" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="twelveyears.c5.s101">An evening or two after Robert's burial, I was leaning on the hatchway near the forecastle, full of desponding thoughts, when a sailor in a kind voice asked me why I was so down-hearted.</s> <s sid="102" id="twelveyears.c5.s102">The tone and manner of the man assured me, and I answered, because I was a freeman, and had been kidnapped.</s> <s sid="103" id="twelveyears.c5.s103">He remarked that it was enough to make any one down-hearted, and continued to interrogate me until he learned the particulars of my whole history.</s> <s sid="104" id="twelveyears.c5.s104">He was evidently much interested in my behalf, and, in the blunt speech of a sailor, swore he would aid me all he could, if it <qs/>"split his timbers."<qe/></s> <s sid="105" id="twelveyears.c5.s105">I requested him to furnish me pen, ink and paper, in order that I might write to some of my friends.</s> <s sid="106" id="twelveyears.c5.s106">He promised to obtain them--but how I could use them undiscovered was a difficulty.</s> <s sid="107" id="twelveyears.c5.s107">If I could only get into the forecastle while his watch was off, and the other sailors asleep, the thing could be accomplished.</s> <s sid="108" id="twelveyears.c5.s108">The small boat instantly occurred to me.</s> <s sid="109" id="twelveyears.c5.s109">He thought we were not far from the Balize, at the mouth of the Mississippi, and it was necessary that the letter be written soon, or the opportunity would be lost.</s> <s sid="110" id="twelveyears.c5.s110">Accordingly, by arrangement, I managed the next night to secret myself again under the long-boat.</s> <s sid="111" id="twelveyears.c5.s111">His watch was off at twelve.</s> <s sid="112" id="twelveyears.c5.s112">I saw him pass into the forecastle, and in about an hour followed him.</s> <s sid="113" id="twelveyears.c5.s113">He was nodding over a table, half asleep, on which a sickly light was flickering, and on which also was a pen and sheet of paper.</s> <s sid="114" id="twelveyears.c5.s114">As I entered he aroused, beckoned me to a seat beside him, and pointed to the paper.</s> <s sid="115" id="twelveyears.c5.s115">I directed the letter to Henry B. Northup, of Sandy Hill--stating that I had been kidnapped, was then on board the brig Orleans, bound for New-Orleans; that it was then impossible for me to conjecture my ultimate destination, and requesting he would take measures to rescue me.</s> <s sid="116" id="twelveyears.c5.s116">The letter was sealed and directed, and Manning, having read it, promised to deposit it in the New-Orleans post-office.</s> <s sid="117" id="twelveyears.c5.s117">I hastened back to my place under the long-boat, and in the morning, as the slaves came up and were walking round, crept out unnoticed and mingled with them.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="twelveyears.c5.p17"><s sid="118" id="twelveyears.c5.s118">My good friend, whose name was John Manning, was an Englishman by birth, and a noble-hearted, generous sailor as ever walked a deck.</s> <s sid="119" id="twelveyears.c5.s119">He had lived in Boston--was a tall, well-built man, about twenty-four years old, with a face somewhat pock-marked, but full of benevolent expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="twelveyears.c5.p18" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="twelveyears.c5.s120">Nothing to vary the monotony of our daily life occurred, until we reached New-Orleans.</s> <s sid="121" id="twelveyears.c5.s121">On coming to the levee, and before the vessel was made fast, I saw Manning leap on shore and hurry away into the city.</s> <s sid="122" id="twelveyears.c5.s122">As he started off he looked back over his shoulder significantly, giving me to understand the object of his errand.</s> <s sid="123" id="twelveyears.c5.s123">Presently he returned, and passing close by me, hunched me with his elbow, with a peculiar wink, as much as to say, <qs/>"it is all right."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="twelveyears.c5.p19"><s sid="124" id="twelveyears.c5.s124">The letter, as I have since learned, reached Sandy Hill.</s> <s sid="125" id="twelveyears.c5.s125">Mr. Northup visited Albany and laid it before Governor Seward, but inasmuch as it gave no definite information as to my probable locality, it was not, at that time, deemed advisable to institute measures for my liberation.</s> <s sid="126" id="twelveyears.c5.s126">It was concluded to delay, trusting that a knowledge of where I was might eventually be obtained.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="twelveyears.c5.p20"><s sid="127" id="twelveyears.c5.s127">A happy and touching scene was witnessed immediately upon our reaching the levee.</s> <s sid="128" id="twelveyears.c5.s128">Just as Manning left the brig, on his way to the post-office, two men came up and called aloud for Arthur.</s> <s sid="129" id="twelveyears.c5.s129">The latter, as he recognized them, was almost crazy with delight.</s> <s sid="130" id="twelveyears.c5.s130">He could hardly be restrained from leaping over the brig's side; and when they met soon after, he grasped them by the hand, and clung to them a long, long time.</s> <s sid="131" id="twelveyears.c5.s131">They were men from Norfolk, who had come on to New-Orleans to rescue him.</s> <s sid="132" id="twelveyears.c5.s132">His kidnappers, they informed him, had been arrested, and were then confined in the Norfolk prison.</s> <s sid="133" id="twelveyears.c5.s133">They conversed a few moments with the captain, and then departed with the rejoicing Arthur.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="twelveyears.c5.p21"><s sid="134" id="twelveyears.c5.s134">But in all the crowd that thronged the wharf, there was no one who knew or cared for me.</s> <s sid="135" id="twelveyears.c5.s135">Not one.</s> <s sid="136" id="twelveyears.c5.s136">No familiar voice greeted my ears, nor was there a single face that I had ever seen.</s> <s sid="137" id="twelveyears.c5.s137">Soon Arthur would rejoin his family, and have the satisfaction of seeing his wrongs avenged: my family, alas, should I ever see them more?</s> <s sid="138" id="twelveyears.c5.s138">There was a feeling of utter desolation in my heart, filling it with a despairing and regretful sense, that I had not gone down with Robert to the bottom of the sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="twelveyears.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="139" id="twelveyears.c5.s139">Very soon traders and consignees came on board.</s> <s sid="140" id="twelveyears.c5.s140">One, a tall, thin-faced man, with light complexion and a little bent, made his appearance, with a paper in his hand.</s> <s sid="141" id="twelveyears.c5.s141">Burch's gang, consisting of myself, Eliza and her children, Harry, Lethe, and some others, who had joined us at Richmond, were consigned to him.</s> <s sid="142" id="twelveyears.c5.s142">This gentleman was Mr. Theophilus Freeman.</s> <s sid="143" id="twelveyears.c5.s143">Reading from his paper, he called, <qs/>"Platt."<qe/></s> <s sid="144" id="twelveyears.c5.s144">No one answered.</s> <s sid="145" id="twelveyears.c5.s145">The name was called again and again, but still there was no reply.</s> <s sid="146" id="twelveyears.c5.s146">Then Lethe was called, then Eliza, then Harry, until the list was finished, each one stepping forward as his or her name was called.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="twelveyears.c5.p28"><s sid="153" id="twelveyears.c5.s153">I informed him that was not my name; that I had never been called by it, but that I had no objection to it as I knew of.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="twelveyears.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="twelveyears.c7.s18">We were two days and three nights on board the steamboat Rodolph, during which time nothing of particular interest occurred.</s> <s sid="19" id="twelveyears.c7.s19">I was now known as Platt, the name given me by Burch, and by which I was designated through the whole period of my servitude.</s> <s sid="20" id="twelveyears.c7.s20">Eliza was sold by the name of <qs/>"Dradey."<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="twelveyears.c7.s21">She was so distinguished in the conveyance to Ford, now on record in the recorder's office in New-Orleans.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="twelveyears.c7.p6"><s sid="40" id="twelveyears.c7.s40">The whole country about Red River is low and marshy.</s> <s sid="41" id="twelveyears.c7.s41">The Pine Woods, as they are called, is comparatively upland, with frequent small intervals, however, running through them.</s> <s sid="42" id="twelveyears.c7.s42">This upland is covered with numerous trees--the white oak, the chincopin, resembling chestnut, but principally the yellow pine.</s> <s sid="43" id="twelveyears.c7.s43">They are of great size, running up sixty feet, and perfectly straight.</s> <s sid="44" id="twelveyears.c7.s44">The woods were full of cattle, very shy and wild, dashing away in herds, with a loud snuff, at our approach.</s> <s sid="45" id="twelveyears.c7.s45">Some of them were marked or branded, the rest appeared to be in their wild and untamed state.</s> <s sid="46" id="twelveyears.c7.s46">They are much smaller than northern breeds, and the peculiarity about them that most attracted my attention was their horns.</s> <s sid="47" id="twelveyears.c7.s47">They stand out from the sides of the head precisely straight, like two iron spikes.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="twelveyears.c7.p7"><s sid="48" id="twelveyears.c7.s48">At noon we reached a cleared piece of ground containing three or four acres.</s> <s sid="49" id="twelveyears.c7.s49">Upon it was a small, unpainted, wooden house, a corn crib, or, as we would say, a barn, and a log kitchen, standing about a rod from the house.</s> <s sid="50" id="twelveyears.c7.s50">It was the summer residence of Mr. Martin.</s> <s sid="51" id="twelveyears.c7.s51">Rich planters, having large establishments on Bayou Boeuf, are accustomed to spend the warmer season in these woods.</s> <s sid="52" id="twelveyears.c7.s52">Here they find clear water and delightful shades.</s> <s sid="53" id="twelveyears.c7.s53">In fact, these retreats are to the planters of that section of the country what Newport and Saratoga are to the wealthier inhabitants of northern cities.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="twelveyears.c7.p8"><s sid="54" id="twelveyears.c7.s54">We were sent around into the kitchen, and supplied with sweet potatoes, corn-bread, and bacon, while Master Ford dined with Martin in the house.</s> <s sid="55" id="twelveyears.c7.s55">There were several slaves about the premises.</s> <s sid="56" id="twelveyears.c7.s56">Martin came out and took a look at us, asking Ford the price of each, if we were green hands, and so forth, and making inquiries in relation to the slave market generally.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="twelveyears.c7.p9"><s sid="57" id="twelveyears.c7.s57">After a long rest we set forth again, following the Texas road, which had the appearance of being very rarely traveled.</s> <s sid="58" id="twelveyears.c7.s58">For five miles we passed through continuous woods without observing a single habitation.</s> <s sid="59" id="twelveyears.c7.s59">At length, just as the sun was sinking in the west, we entered another opening, containing some twelve or fifteen acres.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="twelveyears.c7.p10"><s sid="60" id="twelveyears.c7.s60">In this opening stood a house much larger than Mr. Martin's.</s> <s sid="61" id="twelveyears.c7.s61">It was two stories high, with a piazza in front.</s> <s sid="62" id="twelveyears.c7.s62">In the rear of it was also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs, and several negro cabins.</s> <s sid="63" id="twelveyears.c7.s63">Near the house was a peach orchard, and gardens of orange and pomegranate trees.</s> <s sid="64" id="twelveyears.c7.s64">The space was entirely surrounded by woods, and covered with a carpet of rich, rank verdure.</s> <s sid="65" id="twelveyears.c7.s65">It was a quiet, lonely, pleasant place--literally a green spot in the wilderness.</s> <s sid="66" id="twelveyears.c7.s66">It was the residence of my master, William Ford.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="twelveyears.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="twelveyears.c7.s67">As we approached, a yellow girl--her name was Rose--was standing on the piazza.</s> <s sid="68" id="twelveyears.c7.s68">Going to the door, she called her mistress, who presently came running out to meet her lord.</s> <s sid="69" id="twelveyears.c7.s69">She kissed him, and laughingly demanded if he had bought <qs/>"those niggers."<qe/></s> <s sid="70" id="twelveyears.c7.s70">Ford said he had, and told us to go round to Sally's cabin and rest ourselves.</s> <s sid="71" id="twelveyears.c7.s71">Turning the corner of the house, we discovered Sally washing--her two baby children near her, rolling on the grass.</s> <s sid="72" id="twelveyears.c7.s72">They jumped up and toddled towards us, looked at us a moment like a brace of rabbits, then ran back to their mother as if afraid of us.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="twelveyears.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="twelveyears.c7.s73">Sally conducted us into the cabin, told us to lay down our bundles and be seated, for she was sure that we were tired.</s> <s sid="74" id="twelveyears.c7.s74">Just then John, the cook, a boy some sixteen years of age, and blacker than any crow, came running in, looked steadily in our faces, then turning round, without saying as much as <qs/>"how d'ye do,"<qe/> ran back to the kitchen, laughing loudly, as if our coming was a great joke indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="twelveyears.c7.p13"><s sid="75" id="twelveyears.c7.s75">Much wearied with our walk, as soon as it was dark, Harry and I wrapped our blankets round us, and laid down upon the cabin floor.</s> <s sid="76" id="twelveyears.c7.s76">My thoughts, as usual, wandered back to my wife and children.</s> <s sid="77" id="twelveyears.c7.s77">The consciousness of my real situation; the hopelessness of any effort to escape through the wide forests of Avoyelles, pressed heavily upon me, yet my heart was at home in Saratoga.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="twelveyears.c7.p14"><s sid="78" id="twelveyears.c7.s78">I was awakened early in the morning by the voice of Master Ford, calling Rose.</s> <s sid="79" id="twelveyears.c7.s79">She hastened into the house to dress the children, Sally to the field to milk the cows, while John was busy in the kitchen preparing breakfast.</s> <s sid="80" id="twelveyears.c7.s80">In the meantime Harry and I were strolling about the yard, looking at our new quarters.</s> <s sid="81" id="twelveyears.c7.s81">Just after breakfast a colored man, driving three yoke of oxen, attached to a wagon load of lumber, drove into the opening.</s> <s sid="82" id="twelveyears.c7.s82">He was a slave of Ford's, named Walton, the husband of Rose.</s> <s sid="83" id="twelveyears.c7.s83">By the way, Rose was a native of Washington, and had been brought from thence five years before.</s> <s sid="84" id="twelveyears.c7.s84">She had never seen Eliza, but she had heard of Berry, and they knew the same streets, and the same people, either personally, or by reputation.</s> <s sid="85" id="twelveyears.c7.s85">They became fast friends immediately, and talked a great deal together of old times, and of friends they had left behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="twelveyears.c7.p15"><s sid="86" id="twelveyears.c7.s86">Ford was at that time a wealthy man.</s> <s sid="87" id="twelveyears.c7.s87">Besides his seat in the Pine Woods, he owned a large lumbering establishment on Indian Creek, four miles distant, and also, in his wife's right, an extensive plantation and many slaves on Bayou Boeuf.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="twelveyears.c7.p17"><s sid="91" id="twelveyears.c7.s91">Eliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the loss of her children.</s> <s sid="92" id="twelveyears.c7.s92">Ford tried as much as possible to console her--told her she need not work very hard; that she might remain with Rose, and assist the madam in the house affairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="twelveyears.c7.p18"><s sid="93" id="twelveyears.c7.s93">Riding with Walton in the wagon, Harry and I became quite well acquainted with him long before reaching Indian Creek.</s> <s sid="94" id="twelveyears.c7.s94">He was a "born thrall" of Ford's, and spoke kindly and affectionately of him, as a child would speak of his own father.</s> <s sid="95" id="twelveyears.c7.s95">In answer to his inquiries from whence I came, I told him from Washington.</s> <s sid="96" id="twelveyears.c7.s96">Of that city, he had heard much from his wife, Rose, and all the way plied me with many extravagant and absurd questions.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="twelveyears.c7.p19"><s sid="97" id="twelveyears.c7.s97">On reaching the mills at Indian Creek, we found two more of Ford's slaves, Sam and Antony.</s> <s sid="98" id="twelveyears.c7.s98">Sam, also, was a Washingtonian, having been brought out in the same gang with Rose.</s> <s sid="99" id="twelveyears.c7.s99">He had worked on a farm near Georgetown.</s> <s sid="100" id="twelveyears.c7.s100">Antony was a blacksmith, from Kentucky, who had been in his present master's service about ten years.</s> <s sid="101" id="twelveyears.c7.s101">Sam knew Burch, and when informed that he was the trader who had sent me on from Washington, it was remarkable how well we agreed upon the subject of his superlative rascality.</s> <s sid="102" id="twelveyears.c7.s102">He had forwarded Sam, also.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="twelveyears.c7.p20"><s sid="103" id="twelveyears.c7.s103">On Ford's arrival at the mill, we were employed in piling lumber, and chopping logs, which occupation we continued during the remainder of the summer.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="twelveyears.c7.p21"><s sid="104" id="twelveyears.c7.s104">We usually spent our Sabbaths at the opening, on which days our master would gather all his slaves about him, and read and expound the Scriptures.</s> <s sid="105" id="twelveyears.c7.s105">He sought to inculcate in our minds feelings of kindness towards each other, of dependence upon God--setting forth the rewards promised unto those who lead an upright and prayerful life.</s> <s sid="106" id="twelveyears.c7.s106">Seated in the doorway of his house, surrounded by his man-servants and his maid-servants, who looked earnestly into the good man's face, he spoke of the loving kindness of the Creator, and of the life that is to come.</s> <s sid="107" id="twelveyears.c7.s107">Often did the voice of prayer ascend from his lips to heaven, the only sound that broke the solitude of the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="twelveyears.c7.p22" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="twelveyears.c7.s108">In the course of the summer Sam became deeply convicted, his mind dwelling intensely on the subject of religion.</s> <s sid="109" id="twelveyears.c7.s109">His mistress gave him a Bible, which he carried with him to his work.</s> <s sid="110" id="twelveyears.c7.s110">Whatever leisure time was allowed him, he spent in perusing it, though it was only with great difficulty that he could master any part of it.</s> <s sid="111" id="twelveyears.c7.s111">I often read to him, a favor which he well repaid me by many expressions of gratitude.</s> <s sid="112" id="twelveyears.c7.s112">Sam's piety was frequently observed by white men who came to the mill, and the remark it most generally provoked was, that a man like Ford, who allowed his slaves to have Bibles, was <qs/>"not fit to own a nigger."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="twelveyears.c7.p23"><s sid="113" id="twelveyears.c7.s113">He, however, lost nothing by his kindness.</s> <s sid="114" id="twelveyears.c7.s114">It is a fact I have more than once observed, that those who treated their slaves most leniently, were rewarded by the greatest amount of labor.</s> <s sid="115" id="twelveyears.c7.s115">I know it from my own experience.</s> <s sid="116" id="twelveyears.c7.s116">It was a source of pleasure to surprise Master Ford with a greater day's work than was required, while, under subsequent masters, there was no prompter to extra effort but the overseer's lash.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="twelveyears.c7.p24"><s sid="117" id="twelveyears.c7.s117">It was the desire of Ford's approving voice that suggested to me an idea that resulted to his profit.</s> <s sid="118" id="twelveyears.c7.s118">The lumber we were manufacturing was contracted to be delivered at Lamourie.</s> <s sid="119" id="twelveyears.c7.s119">It had hitherto been transported by land, and was an important item of expense.</s> <s sid="120" id="twelveyears.c7.s120">Indian Creek, upon which the mills were situated, was a narrow but deep stream emptying into Bayou Boeuf.</s> <s sid="121" id="twelveyears.c7.s121">In some places it was not more than twelve feet wide, and much obstructed with trunks of trees.</s> <s sid="122" id="twelveyears.c7.s122">Bayou Boeuf was connected with Bayou Lamourie.</s> <s sid="123" id="twelveyears.c7.s123">I ascertained the distance from the mills to the point on the latter bayou, where our lumber was to be delivered, was but a few miles less by land than by water.</s> <s sid="124" id="twelveyears.c7.s124">Provided the creek could be made navigable for rafts, it occurred to me that the expense of transportation would be materially diminished.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="twelveyears.c15.p4"><s sid="11" id="twelveyears.c15.s11">Three gangs are employed in the operation.</s> <s sid="12" id="twelveyears.c15.s12">One draws the cane from the rick, or stack, cutting the top and flags from the stalk, leaving only that part which is sound and healthy.</s> <s sid="13" id="twelveyears.c15.s13">Each joint of the cane has an eye, like the eye of a potato, which sends forth a sprout when buried in the soil.</s> <s sid="14" id="twelveyears.c15.s14">Another gang lays the cane in the drill, placing two stalks side by side in such manner that joints will occur once in four or six inches.</s> <s sid="15" id="twelveyears.c15.s15">The third gang follows with hoes, drawing earth upon the stalks, and covering them to the depth, of three inches.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="twelveyears.c15.p10"><s sid="64" id="twelveyears.c15.s64">There are larger mills, and those constructed differently from the one thus imperfectly described, but none, perhaps, more celebrated than this anywhere on Bayou Boeuf.</s> <s sid="65" id="twelveyears.c15.s65">Lambert, of New-Orleans, is a partner of Hawkins.</s> <s sid="66" id="twelveyears.c15.s66">He is a man of vast wealth, holding, as I have been told, an interest in over forty different sugar plantations in Louisiana.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="twelveyears.c15.p13" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="twelveyears.c15.s75">It is the custom for one planter to give a <qs/>"Christmas supper,"<qe/> inviting the slaves from neighboring plantations to join his own on the occasion; for instance, one year it is given by Epps, the next by Marshall, the next by Hawkins, and so on.</s> <s sid="76" id="twelveyears.c15.s76">Usually from three to five hundred are assembled, coming together on foot, in carts, on horseback, on mules, riding double and triple, sometimes a boy and girl, at others a girl and two boys, and at others again a boy, a girl and an old woman.</s> <s sid="77" id="twelveyears.c15.s77">Uncle Abram astride a mule, with Aunt Phebe and Patsey behind him, trotting towards a Christmas supper, would be no uncommon sight on Bayou Boeuf.</s> </p>
