<title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="coral.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="coral.c1.s1">The beginning--My early life and character--I thirst for adventure in foreign lands and go to sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c1.s2">Roving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my heart, the very sunshine of my existence.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c1.s3">In childhood, in boyhood, and in man's estate, I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="coral.c1.s4">It was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night in which I was born on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c1.s5">My father was a sea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had been a marine.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c1.s6">Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_ father had followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an admiral in the royal navy.</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c1.s7">At anyrate we knew that, as far back as our family could be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great watery waste.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c1.s8">Indeed this was the case on both sides of the house; for my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so spent the greater part of her life upon the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c1.p4"><s sid="9" id="coral.c1.s9">Thus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition.</s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c1.s10">Soon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring life, purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c1.s11">It was not long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c1.s12">For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength, so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a man; all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c1.s13">One day I took advantage of my dear mother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c1.s14">Ah, how vividly I remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body!</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c1.s15">From this time forth my rambles became more frequent, and, as I grew older, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting vessel, and let me go to sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="coral.c1.s16">For some years I was happy in visiting the sea-ports, and in coasting along the shores of my native land.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c1.s17">My Christian name was Ralph, and my comrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the passion which I always evinced for travelling.</s> <s sid="18" id="coral.c1.s18">Rover was not my real name, but as I never received any other I came at last to answer to it as naturally as to my proper name; and, as it is not a bad one, I see no good reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph Rover.</s> <s sid="19" id="coral.c1.s19">My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got on very well together.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c1.s20">They did, indeed, very frequently make game of and banter me, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying that Ralph Rover was a <qs/>"queer, old-fashioned fellow."<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c1.s21">This, I must confess, surprised me much, and I pondered the saying long, but could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my old-fashionedness lay.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c1.s22">It is true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke except when spoken to.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c1.s23">Moreover, I never could understand the jokes of my companions even when they were explained to me: which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much grief; however, I tried to make up for it by smiling and looking pleased when I observed that they were laughing at some witticism which I had failed to detect.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c1.s24">I was also very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind.</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c1.s25">But in all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural, and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me <qs/>"an old-fashioned fellow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c1.p6"><s sid="26" id="coral.c1.s26">Now, while engaged in the coasting trade, I fell in with many seamen who had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess that my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild adventures in foreign lands,--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the appalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had seen both on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and strange people they had visited.</s> <s sid="27" id="coral.c1.s27">But of all the places of which they told me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral Islands of the Southern Seas.</s> <s sid="28" id="coral.c1.s28">They told me of thousands of beautiful fertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the coral insect, where summer reigned nearly all the year round,--where the trees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit,--where the climate was almost perpetually delightful,--yet where, strange to say, men were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles to which the gospel of our Saviour had been conveyed.</s> <s sid="29" id="coral.c1.s29">These exciting accounts had so great an effect upon my mind, that, when I reached the age of fifteen, I resolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="coral.c1.s30">I had no little difficulty at first in prevailing on my dear parents to let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the truth of what I said, and gave his consent.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c1.s31">My dear mother, seeing that my father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c1.s32"><qs/>"But oh, Ralph,"<qe/><sls/> she said, on the day I bade her adieu, <sle/><qs/>"come back soon to us, my dear boy, for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may not have many years to live."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c1.p8"><s sid="33" id="coral.c1.s33">I will not take up my reader's time with a minute account of all that occurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c1.s34">Suffice it to say, that my father placed me under the charge of an old mess-mate of his own, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South Seas in his own ship, the Arrow.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c1.s35">My mother gave me her blessing and a small Bible; and her last request was, that I would never forget to read a chapter every day, and say my prayers; which I promised, with tears in my eyes, that I would certainly do.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c1.p9"><s sid="36" id="coral.c1.s36">Soon afterwards I went on board the Arrow, which was a fine large ship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER II.</title>
<p pid="1" id="coral.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="coral.c2.s1">The departure--The sea--My companions--Some account of the wonderful sights we saw on the great deep--A dreadful storm and a frightful wreck.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c2.s2">It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvass to the breeze, and sailed for the regions of the south.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c2.s3">Oh, how my heart bounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors, while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c2.s4">The captain shouted--the men ran to obey--the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and the shore gradually faded from my view, while I stood looking on with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="coral.c2.s5">The first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on deck, and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever, and would require its services no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="coral.c2.s6"><qs/>"There, lass,"<qe/><sls/> cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was completed--<sle/><qs/>"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we shan't ask you to kiss the mud again for many a long day to come!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c2.p5"><s sid="7" id="coral.c2.s7">And so it was.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c2.s8">That anchor did not "kiss the mud" for many long days afterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c2.p6"><s sid="9" id="coral.c2.s9">There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special favourites.</s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c2.s10">Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c2.s11">He had had a good education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild and quiet in disposition.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c2.s12">Jack was a general favourite, and had a peculiar fondness for me.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c2.s13">My other companion was Peterkin Gay.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c2.s14">He was little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years old.</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c2.s15">But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could not have been so much beloved as he was.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="coral.c2.s16"><qs/>"Hallo! youngster,"<qe/><sls/> cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder, the day I joined the ship, <sle/><qs/>"come below and I'll show you your berth.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c2.s17">You and I are to be mess-mates, and I think we shall be good friends, for I like the look o' you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c2.p8"><s sid="18" id="coral.c2.s18">Jack was right.</s> <s sid="19" id="coral.c2.s19">He and I and Peterkin afterwards became the best and stanchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c2.p9"><s sid="20" id="coral.c2.s20">I shall say little about the first part of our voyage.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c2.s21">We had the usual amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling in the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of flying fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot above the surface.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c2.s22">They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them, and one flying-fish in its terror flew over the ship, struck on the rigging, and fell upon the deck.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c2.s23">Its wings were just fins elongated, and we found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted into the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c2.s24">Jack and I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c2.p10"><s sid="25" id="coral.c2.s25">When we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of America, the weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="coral.c2.s26"><qs/>"Cape Horn,"<qe/><sss/> said one, <sse/><qs/>"is the most horrible headland I ever doubled.</s> <s sid="27" id="coral.c2.s27">I've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most blow'd out o' the water."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="coral.c2.s28"><qs/>"An' I've been round it once,"<qe/><sss/> said another, <sse/><qs/>"an' that time the sails were split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks, so that they wouldn't work, and we wos all but lost."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="coral.c2.s29"><qs/>"An' I've been round it five times,"<qe/><sss/> cried a third, <sse/><qs/>"an' every time wos wuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="coral.c2.s30"><qs/>"And I've been round it no times at all,"<qe/><sls/> cried Peterkin, with an impudent wink of his eye, <sle/><qs/>"an' _that_ time I wos blow'd inside out!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c2.p15"><s sid="31" id="coral.c2.s31">Nevertheless, we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and, in the course of a few weeks afterwards, were sailing gently, before a warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c2.s32">Thus we proceeded on our voyage, sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze, at other times floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the deep,--all of which, although the sailors thought little of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c2.p16"><s sid="33" id="coral.c2.s33">At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific, and I shall never forget the delight with which I gazed,--when we chanced to pass one,--at the pure, white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees, which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c2.s34">And often did we three long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness there!</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c2.s35">Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c2.p17"><s sid="36" id="coral.c2.s36">One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon our ship.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c2.s37">The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts; and left only the foremast standing.</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c2.s38">Even this, however, was more than enough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c2.s39">For five days the tempest raged in all its fury.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c2.s40">Everything was swept off the decks except one small boat.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c2.s41">The steersman was lashed to the wheel, lest he should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c2.s42">The captain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far out of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c2.s43">At day-break on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c2.s44">It was an island encircled by a reef of coral on which the waves broke in fury.</s> <s sid="45" id="coral.c2.s45">There was calm water within this reef, but we could only see one narrow opening into it.</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c2.s46">For this opening we steered, but, ere we reached it, a tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and left us at the mercy of the winds and waves.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="coral.c2.s47"><qs/>"It's all over with us now, lads,"<qe/><sls/> said the captain to the men; <sle/><qs/>"get the boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than half an hour."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c2.p19"><s sid="48" id="coral.c2.s48">The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="coral.c2.s49"><qs/>"Come boys,"<qe/><sls/> said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we stood on the quarterdeck awaiting our fate;--<sle/><qs/>"Come boys, we three shall stick together.</s> <s sid="50" id="coral.c2.s50">You see it is impossible that the little boat can reach the shore, crowded with men.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c2.s51">It will be sure to upset, so I mean rather to trust myself to a large oar, I see through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into the quiet water inside; so, if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.</s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c2.s52">What say you; will you join me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="coral.c2.s53">We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence, although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had little hope; and, indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there was but a step between us and death.</s> <s sid="54" id="coral.c2.s54">My heart sank within me; but at that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered those words, which were among the last that she said to me--<qs/>"Ralph, my dearest child, always remember in the hour of danger to look to your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c2.s55">He alone is both able and willing to save your body and your soul."<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="coral.c2.s56">So I felt much comforted when I thought thereon.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c2.p22"><s sid="57" id="coral.c2.s57">The ship was now very near the rocks.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c2.s58">The men were ready with the boat, and the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came towards us.</s> <s sid="59" id="coral.c2.s59">We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c2.s60">At the same moment the ship struck, the foremast broke off close to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along with it.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c2.s61">Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an axe to cut it free, but, owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c2.s62">Another wave, however, washed it clear of the wreck.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c2.s63">We all seized hold of it, and the next instant we were struggling in the wild sea.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c2.s64">The last thing I saw was the boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c2.s65">Then I became insensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c2.p23"><s sid="66" id="coral.c2.s66">On recovering from my swoon, I found myself lying on a bank of soft grass, under the shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c3.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c3.s2">There is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from a state of insensibility, which is almost indescribable; a sort of dreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking half-sleeping condition, accompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means disagreeable.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c3.s3">As I slowly recovered and heard the voice of Peterkin inquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept myself, and should be sent to the mast-head for being lazy; but before I could leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and I fancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek, and I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's cottage, with its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honey-suckle that my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c3.s4">But the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I was back again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and reefing topsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c3.s5">Gradually the roar of the surf became louder and more distinct.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c3.s6">I thought of being wrecked far far away from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was gazing into my face.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c4.p14"><s sid="61" id="coral.c4.s61">On coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the axe out of the oar, into which, it will be remembered, Jack struck it while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become entangled at the bow of the ship.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c4.s62">Fortunately for us the axe had remained fast in the oar, and even now, all Peterkin's strength could not draw it out of the cut.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c4.p18" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="coral.c4.s73"><qs/>"Now, lads,"<qe/><sls/> said Jack, after we had laid it on the stone which contained our little all, <sle/><qs/>"I propose that we should go to the tail of the island, where the ship struck, which is only a quarter of a mile off, and see if anything else has been thrown ashore.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c4.s74">I don't expect anything, but it is well to see.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c4.s75">When we get back here it will be time to have our supper and prepare our beds."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c6.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c6.s2">Our first care, after breakfast, was to place the few articles we possessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a small cave which we discovered near our encampment.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c6.s3">This cave, we hoped, might be useful to us afterwards as a store-house.</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c6.s4">Then we cut two large clubs off a species of very hard tree which grew near at hand.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c6.s5">One of these was given to Peterkin, the other to me, and Jack armed himself with the axe.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c6.s6">We took these precautions because we purposed to make an excursion to the top of the mountains of the interior, in order to obtain a better view of our island.</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c6.s7">Of course we knew not what dangers might befall us by the way, so thought it best to be prepared.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c6.p3"><s sid="8" id="coral.c6.s8">Having completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished our fire, we sallied forth and walked a short distance along the sea-beach, till we came to the entrance of a valley, through which flowed the rivulet before mentioned.</s> <s sid="9" id="coral.c6.s9">Here we turned our backs on the sea and struck into the interior.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c6.p4"><s sid="10" id="coral.c6.s10">The prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley was truly splendid.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c6.s11">On either side of us there was a gentle rise in the land, which thus formed two ridges about a mile apart on each side of the valley.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c6.s12">These ridges,--which, as well as the low grounds between them, were covered with trees and shrubs of the most luxuriant kind--continued to recede inland for about two miles, when they joined the foot of a small mountain.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c6.s13">This hill rose rather abruptly from the head of the valley, and was likewise entirely covered even to the top with trees, except on one particular spot near the left shoulder, where was a bare and rocky place of a broken and savage character.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c6.s14">Beyond this hill we could not see, and we therefore directed our course up the banks of the rivulet towards the foot of it, intending to climb to the top, should that be possible, as, indeed, we had no doubt it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c6.p5"><s sid="15" id="coral.c6.s15">Jack, being the wisest and boldest among us, took the lead, carrying the axe on his shoulder.</s> <s sid="16" id="coral.c6.s16">Peterkin, with his enormous club, came second, as he said he should like to be in a position to defend me if any danger should threaten.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c6.s17">I brought up the rear, but, having been more taken up with the wonderful and curious things I saw at starting than with thoughts of possible danger, I had very foolishly left my club behind me.</s> <s sid="18" id="coral.c6.s18">Although, as I have said the trees and bushes were very luxuriant, they were not so thickly crowded together as to hinder our progress among them.</s> <s sid="19" id="coral.c6.s19">We were able to wind in and out, and to follow the banks of the stream quite easily, although, it is true, the height and thickness of the foliage prevented us from seeing far ahead.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c6.s20">But sometimes a jutting- out rock on the hill sides afforded us a position whence we could enjoy the romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the hill.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c6.s21">I wag particularly struck, during the walk, with the richness of the undergrowth in most places, and recognised many berries and plants that resembled those of my native land, especially a tall, elegantly-formed fern, which emitted an agreeable perfume.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c6.s22">There were several kinds of flowers, too, but I did not see so many of these as I should have expected in such a climate.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c6.s23">We also saw a great variety of small birds of bright plumage, and many paroquets similar to the one that awoke Peterkin so rudely in the morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c6.p6"><s sid="24" id="coral.c6.s24">Thus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering anything to alarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing close under a part of the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of the banana trees, which grew in great luxuriance in that part.</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c6.s25">Jack was just preparing to force his way through this thicket, when we were startled and arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which appeared to us quite different from any of the sounds we had heard during the previous part of our walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c6.p11"><s sid="30" id="coral.c6.s30">Again the rumbling sound came, louder than before, and we all sprang back and stood on the defensive.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c6.s31">For myself, having forgotten my club, and not having taken the precaution to cut another, I buttoned my jacket, doubled my fists, and threw myself into a boxing attitude.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c6.s32">I must say, however, that I felt somewhat uneasy; and my companions afterwards confessed that their thoughts at this moment had been instantly filled with all they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and savages, torturings at the stake, roastings alive, and such like horrible things.</s> <s sid="33" id="coral.c6.s33">Suddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold violence.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c6.s34">It was followed by a fearful crash among the bushes, which was rapidly repeated, as if some gigantic animal were bounding towards us.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c6.s35">In another moment an enormous rock came crashing through the shrubbery, followed by a cloud of dust and small stones, flew close past the spot where we stood, carrying bushes and young trees along with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c6.p12" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="coral.c6.s36"><qs/>"Pooh! is that all?"<qe/> exclaimed Peterkin, wiping the perspiration off his forehead.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c6.s37"><qs/>"Why, I thought it was all the wild men and beasts in the South Sea Islands galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the face of the earth, instead of a mere stone tumbling down the mountain side."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c6.p13" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="coral.c6.s38"><qs/>"Nevertheless,"<qe/><sss/> remarked Jack, <sse/><qs/>"if that same stone had hit any of us, it would have rendered the charge you speak of quite unnecessary, Peterkin."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c6.p14"><s sid="39" id="coral.c6.s39">This was true, and I felt very thankful for our escape.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c6.s40">On examining the spot more narrowly, we found that it lay close to the foot of a very rugged precipice, from which stones of various sizes were always tumbling at intervals.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c6.s41">Indeed, the numerous fragments lying scattered all around might have suggested the cause of the sound, had we not been too suddenly alarmed to think of anything.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c6.p15"><s sid="42" id="coral.c6.s42">We now resumed our journey, resolving that, in our future excursions into the interior, we would be careful to avoid this dangerous precipice.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c6.p16"><s sid="43" id="coral.c6.s43">Soon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill and prepared to ascend it.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c6.s44">Here Jack made a discovery which caused us all very great joy.</s> <s sid="45" id="coral.c6.s45">This was a tree of a remarkably beautiful appearance, which Jack confidently declared to be the celebrated bread-fruit tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c6.p17" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="coral.c6.s46"><qs/>"Is it celebrated?"<qe/> inquired Peterkin, with a look of great simplicity.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c6.p20" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="coral.c6.s49"><qs/>"Then it's not so celebrated as I thought it was,"<qe/><sls/> returned Jack, quietly squeezing Peterkin's hat over his eyes; <sle/><qs/>"but listen, you ignorant boobie! and hear of it now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c6.p21"><s sid="50" id="coral.c6.s50">Peterkin re-adjusted his hat, and was soon listening with as much interest as myself, while Jack told us that this tree is one of the most valuable in the islands of the south; that it bears two, sometimes three, crops of fruit in the year; that the fruit is very like wheaten bread in appearance, and that it constitutes the principal food of many of the islanders.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c6.p22" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="coral.c6.s51"><qs/>"So,"<qe/><sss/> said Peterkin, <sse/><qs/>"we seem to have everything ready prepared to our hands in this wonderful island,--lemonade ready bottled in nuts, and loaf- bread growing on the trees!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c6.p23" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="coral.c6.s52">Peterkin, as usual, was jesting; nevertheless, it is a curious fact that he spoke almost the literal truth.</s> <s sid="53" id="coral.c6.s53"><qs/>"Moreover,"<qe/><sss/> continued Jack, <sse/><qs/>"the bread-fruit tree affords a capital gum, which serves the natives for pitching their canoes; the bark of the young branches is made by them into cloth; and of the wood, which is durable and of a good colour, they build their houses.</s> <s sid="54" id="coral.c6.s54">So you see, lads, that we have no lack of material here to make us comfortable, if we are only clever enough to use it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c6.p24" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="coral.c6.s55"><qs/>"But are you sure that that's it?"<qe/> asked Peterkin.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c6.p25" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="coral.c6.s56"><qs/>"Quite sure,"<qe/><sss/> replied Jack; <sse/><qs/>"for I was particularly interested in the account I once read of it, and I remember the description well.</s> <s sid="57" id="coral.c6.s57">I am sorry, however, that I have forgotten the descriptions of many other trees which I am sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise them.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c6.s58">So you see, Peterkin, I'm not up to everything yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c6.p26" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="coral.c6.s59"><qs/>"Never mind, Jack,"<qe/><sls/> said Peterkin, with a grave, patronizing expression of countenance, patting his tall companion on the shoulder,--<sle/><qs/>"never mind, Jack; you know a good deal for your age.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c6.s60">You're a clever boy, sir,--a promising young man; and if you only go on as you have begun, sir, you will--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c6.p27"><s sid="61" id="coral.c6.s61">The end of this speech was suddenly cut short by Jack tripping up Peterkin's heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick shrubs, where, finding himself comfortable, he lay still basking in the sunshine, while Jack and I examined the bread-tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c6.p28"><s sid="62" id="coral.c6.s62">We were much struck with the deep, rich green colour of its broad leaves, which were twelve or eighteen inches long, deeply indented, and of a glossy smoothness, like the laurel.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c6.s63">The fruit, with which it was loaded, was nearly round, and appeared to be about six inches in diameter, with a rough rind, marked with lozenge-shaped divisions.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c6.s64">It was of various colours, from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c6.s65">Jack said that the yellow was the ripe fruit.</s> <s sid="66" id="coral.c6.s66">We afterwards found that most of the fruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and that we might, when we wished, pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the same tree.</s> <s sid="67" id="coral.c6.s67">Such a wonderful difference from the trees of our own country surprised us not a little.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c6.s68">The bark of the tree was rough and light-coloured; the trunk was about two feet in diameter, and it appeared to be twenty feet high, being quite destitute of branches up to that height, where it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head.</s> <s sid="69" id="coral.c6.s69">We noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the branches; but as we were anxious to get to the top of the hill, we refrained from attempting to pluck any at that time.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="coral.c6.p29"><s sid="70" id="coral.c6.s70">Our hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune, and it was with light and active steps that we clambered up the steep sides of the hill.</s> <s sid="71" id="coral.c6.s71">On reaching the summit, a new, and if possible a grander, prospect met our gaze.</s> <s sid="72" id="coral.c6.s72">We found that this was not the highest part of the island, but that another hill lay beyond, with a wide valley between it and the one on which we stood.</s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c6.s73">This valley, like the first, was also full of rich trees, some dark and some light green, some heavy and thick in foliage, and others light, feathery, and graceful, while the beautiful blossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow tint over all, and gave to the valley the appearance of a garden of flowers.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c6.s74">Among these we recognised many of the bread-fruit trees, laden with yellow fruit, and also a great many cocoa-nut palms.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c6.s75">After gazing our fill we pushed down the hill side, crossed the valley, and soon began to ascend the second mountain.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c6.s76">It was clothed with trees nearly to the top, but the summit was bare, and in some places broken.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="coral.c6.p30"><s sid="77" id="coral.c6.s77">While on our way up we came to an object which filled us with much interest.</s> <s sid="78" id="coral.c6.s78">This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down with an axe!</s> <s sid="79" id="coral.c6.s79">So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this beautiful isle.</s> <s sid="80" id="coral.c6.s80">The hand of man had been at work there before us.</s> <s sid="81" id="coral.c6.s81">It now began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited, although we had not seen any traces of man until now; but a second glance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so now than formerly; for the surface of the wood was quite decayed, and partly covered with fungus and green matter, so that it must have been cut many years ago.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="coral.c6.p31" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="coral.c6.s82"><qs/>"Perhaps,"<qe/><sss/> said Peterkin, <sse/><qs/>"some ship or other has touched here long ago for wood, and only taken one tree."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="coral.c6.p32"><s sid="83" id="coral.c6.s83">We did not think this likely, however, because, in such circumstances, the crew of a ship would cut wood of small size, and near the shore, whereas this was a large tree and stood near the top of the mountain.</s> <s sid="84" id="coral.c6.s84">In fact it was the highest large tree on the mountain, all above it being wood of very recent growth.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="coral.c6.p33" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="coral.c6.s85"><qs/>"I can't understand it,"<qe/> said Jack, scratching the surface of the stump with his axe.</s> <s sid="86" id="coral.c6.s86"><qs/>"I can only suppose that the savages have been here and cut it for some purpose known only to themselves.</s> <s sid="87" id="coral.c6.s87">But, hallo! what have we here?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="coral.c6.p34"><s sid="88" id="coral.c6.s88">As he spoke, Jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and fungus from the stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks, as if some inscription or initials had been cut thereon.</s> <s sid="89" id="coral.c6.s89">But although the traces were distinct, beyond all doubt, the exact form of the letters could not be made out.</s> <s sid="90" id="coral.c6.s90">Jack thought they looked like J.

<p pid="35" id="coral.c6.p35"><s sid="93" id="coral.c6.s93">We found this to be the highest point of the island, and from it we saw our kingdom lying, as it were, like a map around us.</s> <s sid="94" id="coral.c6.s94">As I have always thought it impossible to get a thing properly into one's understanding without comprehending it, I shall beg the reader's patience for a little while I describe our island, thus, shortly:--</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="coral.c6.p36"><s sid="95" id="coral.c6.s95">It consisted of two mountains; the one we guessed at 500 feet; the other, on which we stood, at 1000.</s> <s sid="96" id="coral.c6.s96">Between these lay a rich, beautiful valley, as already said.</s> <s sid="97" id="coral.c6.s97">This valley crossed the island from one end to the other, being high in the middle and sloping on each side towards the sea.</s> <s sid="98" id="coral.c6.s98">The large mountain sloped, on the side farthest from where we had been wrecked, gradually towards the sea; but although, when viewed at a glance, it had thus a regular sloping appearance, a more careful observation showed that it was broken up into a multitude of very small vales, or rather dells and glens, intermingled with little rugged spots and small but abrupt precipices here and there, with rivulets tumbling over their edges and wandering down the slopes in little white streams, sometimes glistening among the broad leaves of the bread-fruit and cocoa- nut trees, or hid altogether beneath the rich underwood.</s> <s sid="99" id="coral.c6.s99">At the base of this mountain lay a narrow bright green plain or meadow, which terminated abruptly at the shore.</s> <s sid="100" id="coral.c6.s100">On the other side of the island, whence we had come, stood the smaller hill, at the foot of which diverged three valleys; one being that which we had ascended, with a smaller vale on each side of it, and separated from it by the two ridges before mentioned.</s> <s sid="101" id="coral.c6.s101">In these smaller valleys there were no streams, but they were clothed with the same luxuriant vegetation.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="coral.c6.p37"><s sid="102" id="coral.c6.s102">The diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles, and, as it was almost circular in form, its circumference must have been thirty miles;--perhaps a little more, if allowance be made for the numerous bays and indentations of the shore.</s> <s sid="103" id="coral.c6.s103">The entire island was belted by a beach of pure white sand, on which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon.</s> <s sid="104" id="coral.c6.s104">We now also observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island; but it varied its distance from it here and there, in some places being a mile from the beach, in others, a few hundred yards, but the average distance was half a mile.</s> <s sid="105" id="coral.c6.s105">The reef lay very low, and the spray of the surf broke quite over it in many places.</s> <s sid="106" id="coral.c6.s106">This surf never ceased its roar, for, however calm the weather might be, there is always a gentle swaying motion in the great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable out at sea, reaches the shore at last in a huge billow.</s> <s sid="107" id="coral.c6.s107">The water within the lagoon, as before said, was perfectly still.</s> <s sid="108" id="coral.c6.s108">There were three narrow openings in the reef; one opposite each end of the valley which I have described as crossing the island; the other opposite our own valley, which we afterwards named the Valley of the Wreck.</s> <s sid="109" id="coral.c6.s109">At each of these openings the reef rose into two small green islets, covered with bushes and having one or two cocoa-nut palms on each.</s> <s sid="110" id="coral.c6.s110">These islets were very singular, and appeared as if planted expressly for the purpose of marking the channel into the lagoon.</s> <s sid="111" id="coral.c6.s111">Our captain was making for one of these openings the day we were wrecked, and would have reached it too, I doubt not, had not the rudder been torn away.</s> <s sid="112" id="coral.c6.s112">Within the lagoon were several pretty, low coral islands, just opposite our encampment; and, immediately beyond these, out at sea, lay about a dozen other islands, at various distances, from half a mile to ten miles; all of them, as far as we could discern, smaller than ours and apparently uninhabited.</s> <s sid="113" id="coral.c6.s113">They seemed to be low coral islands, raised but little above the sea, yet covered with cocoa-nut trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="coral.c6.p38"><s sid="114" id="coral.c6.s114">All this we noted, and a great deal more, while we sat on the top of the mountain.</s> <s sid="115" id="coral.c6.s115">After we had satisfied ourselves we prepared to return; but here again we discovered traces of the presence of man.</s> <s sid="116" id="coral.c6.s116">These were a pole or staff and one or two pieces of wood which had been squared with an axe.</s> <s sid="117" id="coral.c6.s117">All of these were, however, very much decayed, and they had evidently not been touched for many years.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="coral.c6.p39"><s sid="118" id="coral.c6.s118">Full of these discoveries we returned to our encampment.</s> <s sid="119" id="coral.c6.s119">On the way we fell in with the traces of some four-footed animal, but whether old or of recent date none of us were able to guess.</s> <s sid="120" id="coral.c6.s120">This also tended to raise our hopes of obtaining some animal food on the island, so we reached home in good spirits, quite prepared for supper, and highly satisfied with our excursion.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="coral.c6.p40"><s sid="121" id="coral.c6.s121">After much discussion, in which Peterkin took the lead, we came to the conclusion that the island was uninhabited, and went to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="coral.c7.s20">One day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and said in a very cross tone, <qs/>"I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to be humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c7.s21">I want you to swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="coral.c7.s24"><qs/>"What say you to building a boat?"<qe/> he inquired, looking up hastily.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c7.p12"><s sid="33" id="coral.c7.s33">This was agreed on, so we started off to a spot not far distant, where we knew of a tree that would suit us, which grew near the water's edge.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c7.s34">As soon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and, wielding the axe with his sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without stopping.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c7.s35">Then he paused, and, while he sat down to rest, I continued the work.</s> <s sid="36" id="coral.c7.s36">Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it, so that when Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes cutting brought it down with a terrible crash.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c7.p14"><s sid="38" id="coral.c7.s38">So saying he began to cut through the stem again, at about six yards from the thick end.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c7.s39">This done, he cut three strong, short poles or levers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end, we could not move it without such helps.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c7.s40">With the levers, however, we rolled it slowly into the sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c7.p15"><s sid="41" id="coral.c7.s41">Having been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the levers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c7.s42">This was easy enough to do; but, after seating ourselves astride the log, it was with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and plunging us into the water.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c7.s43">Not that we minded that much; but we preferred, if possible, to fish in dry clothes.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c7.s44">To be sure, our trousers were necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on each side of the log; but, as they could be easily dried, we did not care.</s> <s sid="45" id="coral.c7.s45">After half an hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep our balance pretty steadily.</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c7.s46">Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and having baited his line with a whole oyster, dropt it into deep water.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c7.p24" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="coral.c7.s67"><qs/>"Got him this time,--that's a fact!"<qe/> cried Peterkin, hauling in the line.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c7.s68"><qs/>"He's swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare.</s> <s sid="69" id="coral.c7.s69">Oh what a thumper!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c7.p25"><s sid="70" id="coral.c7.s70">As the fish came struggling to the surface, we leaned forward to see it, and overbalanced the log.</s> <s sid="71" id="coral.c7.s71">Peterkin threw his arms round the fish's neck; and, in another instant, we were all floundering in the water!</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c7.p26"><s sid="72" id="coral.c7.s72">A shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface like three drowned rats, and seized hold of the log.</s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c7.s73">We soon recovered our position, and sat more warily, while Peterkin secured the fish, which had well-nigh escaped in the midst of our struggles.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c7.s74">It was little worth having, however; but, as Peterkin remarked, it was better than the smouts he had been catching for the last two or three days; so we laid it on the log before us, and having re-baited the line, dropt it in again for another.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c7.p27"><s sid="75" id="coral.c7.s75">Now, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention was suddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards away from us.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c7.s76">Peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that direction, as he thought it was a big fish, and we might have a chance of catching it.</s> <s sid="77" id="coral.c7.s77">But Jack, instead of complying, said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I never before heard him use,--</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c8.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c8.s2">Our encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had befallen us since landing on this island, and we felt very seriously affected by it, especially when we considered that we had so often unwittingly incurred the same danger before while bathing.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c8.s3">We were now forced to take to fishing again in the shallow water, until we should succeed in constructing a raft.</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c8.s4">What troubled us most, however, was, that we were compelled to forego our morning swimming excursions.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c8.s5">We did, indeed, continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water, but Jack and I found that one great source of our enjoyment was gone, when we could no longer dive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom of the lagoon.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c8.s6">We had come to be so fond of this exercise, and to take such an interest in watching the formations of coral and the gambols of the many beautiful fish amongst the forests of red and green sea-weeds, that we had become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and the localities that they chiefly haunted.</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c8.s7">We had also become expert divers.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c8.s8">But we made it a rule never to stay long under water at a time.</s> <s sid="9" id="coral.c8.s9">Jack told me that to do so often was bad for the lungs, and, instead of affording us enjoyment, would ere long do us a serious injury.</s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c8.s10">So we never stayed at the bottom as long as we might have done, but came up frequently to the top for fresh air, and dived down again immediately.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c8.s11">Sometimes, when Jack happened to be in a humorous frame, he would seat himself at the bottom of the sea on one of the brain corals, as if he were seated on a large paddock-stool, and then make faces at me, in order, if possible, to make me laugh under water.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c8.s12">At first, when he took me unawares, he nearly succeeded, and I had to shoot to the surface in order to laugh; but afterwards I became aware of his intentions, and, being naturally of a grave disposition, I had no difficulty in restraining myself.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c8.s13">I used often to wonder how poor Peterkin would have liked to be with us; and he sometimes expressed much regret at being unable to join us.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c8.s14">I used to do my best to gratify him, poor fellow, by relating all the wonders that we saw; but this, instead of satisfying, seemed only to whet his curiosity the more, so one day we prevailed on him to try to go down with us.</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c8.s15">But, although a brave boy in every other way, Peterkin was very nervous in the water, and it was with difficulty we got him to consent to be taken down, for he could never have managed to push himself down to the bottom without assistance.</s> <s sid="16" id="coral.c8.s16">But no sooner had we pulled him down a yard or so into the deep clear water, than he began to struggle and kick violently, so we were forced to let him go, when he rose out of the water like a cork, gave a loud gasp and a frightful roar, and struck out for the land with the utmost possible haste.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c8.p3"><s sid="17" id="coral.c8.s17">Now, all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought thereon, Jack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits.</s> <s sid="18" id="coral.c8.s18">I could see, also, that Peterkin grieved and sympathized with us, for, when talking about this matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c8.p4"><s sid="19" id="coral.c8.s19">As, however, a man's difficulties usually set him upon devising methods to overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things than those he may have lost, so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching for a large pool among the rocks, where the water should be deep enough for diving yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting at us.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c8.s20">And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be very much better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c8.s21">It was situated not more than ten minutes' walk from our camp, and was in the form of a small deep bay or basin, the entrance to which, besides being narrow, was so shallow that no fish so large as a shark could get in, at least not unless he should be a remarkably thin one.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c8.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="coral.c8.s22">Inside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the coral formations were much more wonderful, and the sea-weed plants far more lovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon itself.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c8.s23">And the water was so clear and still, that, although very deep, you could see the minutest object at the bottom.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c8.s24">Besides this, there was a ledge of rock which overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive pleasantly and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all the wonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me creeping amongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom, like, as--he expressed it,--<qs/>"two great white sea-monsters."<qe/></s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c8.s25">During these excursions of ours to the bottom of the sea, we began to get an insight into the manners and customs of its inhabitants, and to make discoveries of wonderful things, the like of which we never before conceived.</s> <s sid="26" id="coral.c8.s26">Among other things, we were deeply interested with the operations of the little coral insect which, I was informed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed many of the numerous islands in Pacific Ocean.</s> <s sid="27" id="coral.c8.s27">And, certainly, when we considered the great reef which these insects had formed round the island on which we were cast, and observed their ceaseless activity in building their myriad cells, it did at first seem as if this might be true; but then, again, when I looked at the mountains of the island, and reflected that there were thousands of such, many of them much higher, in the South Seas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.</s> <s sid="28" id="coral.c8.s28">But more of this hereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c8.p6"><s sid="29" id="coral.c8.s29">I also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the anemones, and star-fish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and such-like creatures; and was not content with watching those I saw during my dives in the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock close to it, which I filled with salt water, and stocked with sundry specimens of anemones and shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how they were in the habit of passing their time.</s> <s sid="30" id="coral.c8.s30">Our burning-glass also now became a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and so to perceive more clearly the forms and actions of these curious creatures of the deep.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c8.p7"><s sid="31" id="coral.c8.s31">Having now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we began to talk of a project which we had long had in contemplation,--namely, to travel entirely round the island; in order, first, to ascertain whether it contained any other productions which might be useful to us; and, second, to see whether there might be any place more convenient and suitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now encamped.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c8.s32">Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it; on the contrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our bower and its neighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, there was no reason why we should not make use of it.</s> <s sid="33" id="coral.c8.s33">At any rate, it would be well to know of its existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c8.p8"><s sid="34" id="coral.c8.s34">We had much earnest talk over this matter.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c8.s35">But Jack proposed that, before undertaking such an excursion, we should supply ourselves with good defensive arms, for, as we intended not only to go round all the shore, but to ascend most of the valleys, before returning home, we should be likely to meet in with, he would not say dangers, but, at least, with everything that existed on the island, whatever that might be.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c8.p9" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="coral.c8.s36"><qs/>"Besides,"<qe/><sss/> said Jack, <sse/><qs/>"it won't do for us to live on cocoa-nuts and oysters always.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c8.s37">No doubt they are very excellent in their way, but I think a little animal food, now and then, would be agreeable as well as good for us; and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of which are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan to make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c8.p10" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="coral.c8.s38"><qs/>"First rate!"<qe/> cried Peterkin.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c8.s39"><qs/>"You will make the bows, Jack, and I'll try my hand at the arrows.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c8.s40">The fact is, I'm quite tired of throwing stones at the birds.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c8.s41">I began the very day we landed, I think, and have persevered up to the present time, but I've never hit anything yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c8.p11" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="coral.c8.s42"><qs/>"You forget,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"you hit me one day on the shin."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="coral.c8.s43"><qs/>"Ah, true,"<qe/><sss/> replied Peterkin, <sse/><qs/>"and a precious shindy you kicked up in consequence.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c8.s44">But you were at least four yards away from the impudent paroquet I aimed at; so you see what a horribly bad shot I am."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="coral.c8.s45"><qs/>"But,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"Jack, you cannot make three bows and arrows before to- morrow, and would it not be a pity to waste time, now that we have made up our minds to go on this expedition?</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c8.s46">Suppose that you make one bow and arrow for yourself, and we can take our clubs?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="coral.c8.s47"><qs/>"That's true, Ralph.</s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c8.s48">The day is pretty far advanced, and I doubt if I can make even one bow before dark.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c8.s49">To be sure I might work by fire-light, after the sun goes down."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c8.p15"><s sid="50" id="coral.c8.s50">We had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed with the sun, as we had no pressing call to work o' nights; and, indeed, our work during the day was usually hard enough,--what between fishing, and improving our bower, and diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the woods; so that, when night came, we were usually very glad to retire to our beds.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c8.s51">But now that we had a desire to work at night, we felt a wish for candles.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c8.p16" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="coral.c8.s52"><qs/>"Won't a good blazing fire give you light enough?"<qe/> inquired Peterkin.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="coral.c8.s53"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> replied Jack, <sse/><qs/>"quite enough; but then it will give us a great deal more than enough of heat in this warm climate of ours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="coral.c8.s54"><qs/>"True,"<qe/><sss/> said Peterkin; <sse/><qs/>"I forgot that.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c8.s55">It would roast us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="coral.c8.s56"><qs/>"Well, as you're always doing that at any rate,"<qe/><sss/> remarked Jack, <sse/><qs/>"we could scarcely call it a change.</s> <s sid="57" id="coral.c8.s57">But the fact is, I've been thinking over this subject before.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c8.s58">There is a certain nut growing in these islands which is called the candle-nut, because the natives use it instead of candles, and I know all about it, and how to prepare it for burning--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c8.p20" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="coral.c8.s59"><qs/>"Then why don't you do it?"<qe/> interrupted Peterkin.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c8.s60"><qs/>"Why have you kept us in the dark so long, you vile philosopher?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="coral.c8.s61"><qs/>"Because,"<qe/><sss/> said Jack, <sse/><qs/>"I have not seen the tree yet, and I'm not sure that I should know either the tree or the nuts if I did see them.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c8.s62">You see, I forget the description."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c8.p22" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="coral.c8.s63"><qs/>"Ah! that's just the way with me,"<qe/> said Peterkin with a deep sigh.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c8.s64"><qs/>"I never could keep in my mind for half an hour the few descriptions I ever attempted to remember.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c8.s65">The very first voyage I ever made was caused by my mistaking a description, or forgetting it, which is the same thing.</s> <s sid="66" id="coral.c8.s66">And a horrible voyage it was.</s> <s sid="67" id="coral.c8.s67">I had to fight with the captain the whole way out, and made the homeward voyage by swimming!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="coral.c8.s68"><qs/>"Come, Peterkin,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"you can't get even _me_ to believe that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="coral.c8.s69"><qs/>"Perhaps not, but it's true, notwithstanding,"<qe/> returned Peterkin, pretending to be hurt at my doubting his word.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c8.p25" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="coral.c8.s70"><qs/>"Let us hear how it happened,"<qe/> said Jack, while a good-natured smile overspread his face.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="coral.c8.s71"><qs/>"Well, you must know,"<qe/><sss/> began Peterkin, <sse/><qs/>"that the very day before I went to sea, I was greatly taken up with a game at hockey, which I was playing with my old school-fellows for the last time before leaving them.</s> <s sid="72" id="coral.c8.s72">You see I was young then, Ralph."<qe/></s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c8.s73">Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and melancholy manner, out to sea!</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c8.s74">"Well, in the midst of the game, my uncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble of getting me bound 'prentice and rigged out, came and took me aside, and told me that he was called suddenly away from home, and would not be able to see me aboard, as he had intended.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c8.s75"><alt-qs/>'However,'<alt-qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><alt-qs/>'the captain knows you are coming, so that's not of much consequence; but as you'll have to find the ship yourself, you must remember her name and description.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c8.s76">D'ye hear, boy?'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="coral.c8.s77">I certainly did hear, but I'm afraid I did not understand, for my mind was so taken up with the game, which I saw my side was losing, that I began to grow impatient, and the moment my uncle finished his description of the ship, and bade me good-bye, I bolted back to my game, with only a confused idea of three masts, and a green painted tafferel, and a gilt figure-head of Hercules with his club at the bow.</s> <s sid="78" id="coral.c8.s78">Next day I was so much cast down with everybody saying good-bye, and a lot o' my female friends cryin' horribly over me, that I did not start for the harbour, where the ship was lying among a thousand others, till it was almost too late.</s> <s sid="79" id="coral.c8.s79">So I had to run the whole way.</s> <s sid="80" id="coral.c8.s80">When I reached the pier, there were so many masts, and so much confusion, that I felt quite humblebumbled in my faculties.</s> <s sid="81" id="coral.c8.s81"><alt-qs/>'Now,'<alt-qe/><sss/> said I to myself, <sse/><alt-qs/>'Peterkin, you're in a fix.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="82" id="coral.c8.s82">Then I fancied I saw a gilt figure-head and three masts, belonging to a ship just about to start; so I darted on board, but speedily jumped on shore again, when I found that two of the masts belonged to another vessel, and the figurehead to a third!</s> <s sid="83" id="coral.c8.s83">At last I caught sight of what I made sure was it,--a fine large vessel just casting off her moorings.</s> <s sid="84" id="coral.c8.s84">The tafferel was green.</s> <s sid="85" id="coral.c8.s85">Three masts,--yes, that must be it,--and the gilt figure-head of Hercules.</s> <s sid="86" id="coral.c8.s86">To be sure it had a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club; but that might be my uncle's mistake; or perhaps Hercules sometimes varied his weapons.</s> <s sid="87" id="coral.c8.s87"><alt-qs/>'Cast off!'<alt-qe/> roared a voice from the quarter-deck.</s> <s sid="88" id="coral.c8.s88"><alt-qs/>'Hold on!'<alt-qe/> cried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.</s> <s sid="89" id="coral.c8.s89"><alt-qs/>'Hold on! hold on!'<alt-qe/> repeated some of the bystanders, while the men at the ropes delayed for a minute.</s> <s sid="90" id="coral.c8.s90">This threw the captain into a frightful rage; for some of his friends had come down to see him off, and having his orders contradicted so flatly was too much for him.</s> <s sid="91" id="coral.c8.s91">However, the delay was sufficient.</s> <s sid="92" id="coral.c8.s92">I took a race and a good leap; the ropes were cast off; the steam-tug gave a puff, and we started.</s> <s sid="93" id="coral.c8.s93">Suddenly the captain was up to me:</s> <s sid="94" id="coral.c8.s94"><alt-qs/>'Where did you come from, you scamp, and what do you want here?'<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c9.p9"><s sid="37" id="coral.c9.s37">As he spoke, there appeared a white column above the rocks, as if of steam or spray.</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c9.s38">It rose upwards to a height of several feet, and then disappeared.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c9.s39">Had this been near the sea, we would not have been so greatly surprised, as it might in that case have been the surf, for at this part of the coast the coral reef approached so near to the island that in some parts it almost joined it.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c9.s40">There was therefore no lagoon between, and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c9.s41">But this white column appeared about fifty yards inland.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c9.s42">The rocks at the place were rugged, and they stretched across the sandy beach into the sea.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c9.s43">Scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight, when another column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the spot where the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long irregular intervals, these strange sights recurred.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c9.s44">We were now quite sure that the columns were watery or composed of spray, but what caused them we could not guess, so we determined to go and see.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c9.p10"><s sid="45" id="coral.c9.s45">In a few minutes we gained the spot, which was very rugged and precipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the spray.</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c9.s46">We had much ado to pass over dry-shod.</s> <s sid="47" id="coral.c9.s47">The ground also was full of holes here and there.</s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c9.s48">Now, while we stood anxiously waiting for the re-appearance of these water-spouts, we heard a low, rumbling sound near us, which quickly increased to a gargling and hissing noise, and a moment afterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in the rock, and spouted into the air with much violence, and so close to where Jack and I were standing that it nearly touched us.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c9.s49">We sprang to one side, but not before a cloud of spray descended, and drenched us both to the skin.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c9.p11"><s sid="50" id="coral.c9.s50">Peterkin, who was standing farther off, escaped with a few drops, and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on beholding our miserable plight.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c9.p12" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="coral.c9.s51"><qs/>"Mind your eye!"<qe/><sss/> he shouted eagerly, <sse/><qs/>"there goes another!"<qe/></s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c9.s52">The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there came up a spout from another hole, which served us exactly in the same manner as before.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c9.p13"><s sid="53" id="coral.c9.s53">Peterkin now shrieked with laughter; but his merriment was abruptly put a stop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to where he stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="coral.c9.s54"><qs/>"Where'll it spout this time, I wonder?"<qe/> he said, looking about with some anxiety, and preparing to run.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c9.s55">Suddenly there came a loud hiss or snort; a fierce spout of water burst up between Peterkin's legs, blew him off his feet, enveloped him in its spray, and hurled him to the ground.</s> <s sid="56" id="coral.c9.s56">He fell with so much violence that we feared he must have broken some of his bones, and ran anxiously to his assistance; but fortunately he had fallen on a clump of tangled herbage, in which he lay sprawling in a most deplorable condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c9.p15"><s sid="57" id="coral.c9.s57">It was now our turn to laugh; but as we were not yet quite sure that he was unhurt, and as we knew not when or where the next spout might arise, we assisted him hastily to jump up and hurry from the spot.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c9.p16"><s sid="58" id="coral.c9.s58">I may here add, that although I am quite certain that the spout of water was very strong, and that it blew Peterkin completely off his legs, I am not quite certain of the exact height to which it lifted him, being somewhat startled by the event, and blinded partially by the spray, so that my power of observation was somewhat impaired for the moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c9.p17" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="coral.c9.s59"><qs/>"What's to be done now?"<qe/> inquired Peterkin ruefully.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c9.p18" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="coral.c9.s60"><qs/>"Make a fire, lad, and dry ourselves,"<qe/> replied Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c9.p19" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="coral.c9.s61"><qs/>"And here is material ready to our hand,"<qe/> said I, picking up a dried branch of a tree, as we hurried up to the woods.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c9.p20"><s sid="62" id="coral.c9.s62">In about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again dried.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c9.s63">While they were hanging up before the fire, we walked down to the beach, and soon observed that these curious spouts took place immediately after the fall of a huge wave, never before it; and, moreover, that the spouts did not take place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c9.s64">From this we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel in the rock into which the water was driven by the larger waves, and finding no way of escape except through these small holes, was thus forced up violently through them.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c9.s65">At any rate, we could not conceive any other reason for these strange water-spouts, and as this seemed a very simple and probable one, we forthwith adopted it.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c9.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="coral.c9.s66"><qs/>"I say, Ralph, what's that in the water? is it a shark?"<qe/> said Jack, just as we were about to quit the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c9.p22"><s sid="67" id="coral.c9.s67">I immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock, from which he was looking down into the sea, and bent over it.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c9.s68">There I saw a very faint pale object of a greenish colour, which seemed to move slightly while I looked at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c9.p23" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="coral.c9.s69"><qs/>"It's like a fish of some sort,"<qe/> said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c9.p24" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="coral.c9.s70"><qs/>"Hallo, Peterkin!"<qe/><sss/> cried Jack, <sse/><qs/>"fetch your spear; here's work for it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c9.p25"><s sid="71" id="coral.c9.s71">But when we tried to reach the object, the spear proved to be too short.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c9.p26" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="coral.c9.s72"><qs/>"There, now,"<qe/><sls/> said Peterkin with a sneer, <sle/><qs/>"you were always telling me it was too long."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c9.p27"><s sid="73" id="coral.c9.s73">Jack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object, and let go his hold; but, although it seemed to be well aimed, he must have missed, for the handle soon rose again; and when the spear was drawn up, there was the pale green object in exactly the same spot, slowly moving its tail.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c9.p28" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="coral.c9.s74"><qs/>"Very odd,"<qe/> said Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="coral.c9.p29"><s sid="75" id="coral.c9.s75">But although it was undoubtedly very odd, and, although Jack and all of us plunged the spear at it repeatedly, we could neither hit it nor drive it away, so we were compelled to continue our journey without discovering what it was.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c9.s76">I was very much perplexed at this strange appearance in the water, and could not get it out of my mind for a long time afterwards.</s> <s sid="77" id="coral.c9.s77">However, I quieted myself by resolving that I would pay a visit to it again at some more convenient season.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c10.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c10.s2">Our examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most satisfactory.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c10.s3">We found in it not only similar trees to those we had already seen in our own valley, but also one or two others of a different species.</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c10.s4">We had also the satisfaction of discovering a peculiar vegetable, which Jack concluded must certainly be that of which he had read as being very common among the South Sea islanders, and which was named _taro_.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c10.s5">Also we found a large supply of yams, and another root like a potato in appearance.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c10.s6">As these were all quite new to us, we regarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast on an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the necessaries of life.</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c10.s7">Long afterwards we found out that this island of ours was no better in these respects than thousands of other islands in those seas.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c10.s8">Indeed, many of them were much richer and more productive; but that did not render us the less grateful for our present good fortune.</s> <s sid="9" id="coral.c10.s9">We each put one of these roots in our pocket, intending to use them for our supper; of which more hereafter.</s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c10.s10">We also saw many beautiful birds here, and traces of some four-footed animal again.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c10.s11">Meanwhile the sun began to descend, so we returned to the shore, and pushed on round the spouting rocks into the next valley.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c10.s12">This was that valley of which I have spoken as running across the entire island.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c10.s13">It was by far the largest and most beautiful that we had yet looked upon.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c10.s14">Here were trees of every shape and size and hue which it is possible to conceive of, many of which we had not seen in the other valleys; for, the stream in this valley being larger, and the mould much richer than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was clothed with a more luxuriant growth of trees and plants.</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c10.s15">Some trees were dark glossy green, others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting well with those of a pale light green, which were everywhere abundant.</s> <s sid="16" id="coral.c10.s16">Among these we recognised the broad dark heads of the bread-fruit, with its golden fruit; the pure, silvery foliage of the candle-nut, and several species which bore a strong resemblance to the pine; while here and there, in groups and in single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa- nut palms, spreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above all the rest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping guard over these luxuriant forests.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c10.s17">Oh! it was a most enchanting scene, and I thanked God for having created such delightful spots for the use of man.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c10.p3"><s sid="18" id="coral.c10.s18">Now, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack uttered an exclamation of surprise, and, pointing to an object a little to one side of us, said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c10.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="coral.c10.s19"><qs/>"That's a banian-tree."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c10.p6" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="coral.c10.s21"><qs/>"A very curious one, as you shall see presently,"<qe/> replied Jack.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c10.s22"><qs/>"It is called the _aoa_ here, if I recollect rightly, and has a wonderful peculiarity about it.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c10.s23">What an enormous one it is, to be sure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c10.p7" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="coral.c10.s24"><qs/>"_It_!"<qe/><sss/> repeated Peterkin; <sse/><qs/>"why, there are dozens of banians here!</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c10.s25">What do you mean by talking bad grammar?</s> <s sid="26" id="coral.c10.s26">Is your philosophy deserting you, Jack?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c10.p8" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="coral.c10.s27"><qs/>"There is but one tree here of this kind,"<qe/><sss/> returned Jack, <sse/><qs/>"as you will perceive if you will examine it."<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="coral.c10.s28">And, sure enough, we did find that what we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.</s> <s sid="29" id="coral.c10.s29">Its bark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves being lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful pea-green.</s> <s sid="30" id="coral.c10.s30">But the wonderful thing about it was, that the branches, which grew out from the stem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which, taking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark like the tree itself.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c10.s31">Many of these fibres had descended from the branches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural pillars, some of which were so large and strong, that it was not easy at first to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c10.s32">The fibres were of all sizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we have just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to take root, and thin brown threads still far from the ground, which swayed about with every motion of wind.</s> <s sid="33" id="coral.c10.s33">In short, it seemed to us that, if there were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at length cover the whole island.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c10.p9"><s sid="34" id="coral.c10.s34">Shortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, which, as its peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us, merits description.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c10.s35">It was a splendid chestnut, but its proper name Jack did not know.</s> <s sid="36" id="coral.c10.s36">However, there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of which we put in our pockets.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c10.s37">But its stem was the wonderful part of it.</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c10.s38">It rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was not of great thickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably slender for the size of the tree; but, to make up for this, there were four or five wonderful projections in this stem, which I cannot better describe than by asking the reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three feet broad had been placed round the trunk of the tree, with their _edges_ closely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and that these planks bad been covered over with the bark of the tree and incorporated with it.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c10.s39">In short, they were just natural buttresses, without which the stem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous top.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c10.s40">We found these chestnuts to be very numerous.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c10.s41">They grew chiefly on the banks of the stream, and were of all sizes.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c10.p10"><s sid="42" id="coral.c10.s42">While we were examining a small tree of this kind, Jack chipped a piece off a buttress with his axe, and found the wood to be firm and easily cut.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c10.s43">He then struck the axe into it with all his force, and very soon split it off close to the tree, first, however, having cut it across transversely above and below.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c10.s44">By this means he satisfied himself that we could now obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size and thickness that we desired; which was a very great discovery indeed, perhaps the most important we had yet made.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c10.p11"><s sid="45" id="coral.c10.s45">We now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp near the beach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest.</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c10.s46">On our way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped around us.</s> <s sid="47" id="coral.c10.s47">Among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a green body, a blue head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful turtledoves, and several flocks of wood-pigeons.</s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c10.s48">The hues of many of these birds were extremely vivid,--bright green, blue, and scarlet, being the prevailing tints.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c10.s49">We made several attempts throughout the day to bring down one of these, both with the bow and the sling,--not for mere sport, but to ascertain whether they were good for food.</s> <s sid="50" id="coral.c10.s50">But we invariably missed, although once or twice we were very near hitting.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c10.s51">As evening drew on, however, a flock of pigeons flew past.</s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c10.s52">I slung a stone into the midst of them at a venture, and had the good fortune to kill one.</s> <s sid="53" id="coral.c10.s53">We were startled, soon after, by a loud whistling noise above our heads; and on looking up, saw a flock of wild ducks making for the coast.</s> <s sid="54" id="coral.c10.s54">We watched these, and, observing where they alighted, followed them up until we came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two hundred yards long, imbosomed in verdant trees.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c10.s55">Its placid surface, which reflected every leaf and stem, as if in a mirror, was covered with various species of wild ducks, feeding among the sedges and broad-leaved water-plants which floated on it, while numerous birds like water-hens ran to and fro most busily on its margin.</s> <s sid="56" id="coral.c10.s56">These all with one accord flew tumultuously away the instant we made our appearance.</s> <s sid="57" id="coral.c10.s57">While walking along the margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort we could not tell.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c10.p12"><s sid="58" id="coral.c10.s58">Now, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a little out of our way to see if we could procure one of those ducks; so, directing Peterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated, promising to rejoin him speedily.</s> <s sid="59" id="coral.c10.s59">But we did not find the ducks, although we made a diligent search for half an hour.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c10.s60">We were about to retrace our steps, when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights that we had yet beheld.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c10.p13"><s sid="61" id="coral.c10.s61">Just in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew a superb tree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c10.s62">Its trunk was at least five feet in diameter, with a smooth gray bark; above this the spreading branches were clothed with light green leaves, amid which were clusters of bright yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh down the boughs with their great weight.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c10.s63">This fruit seemed to be of the plum species, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the magnum bonum plum.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c10.s64">The ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with the fallen fruit, in the midst of which lay sleeping, in every possible attitude, at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes, apparently quite surfeited with a recent banquet.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c10.p14"><s sid="65" id="coral.c10.s65">Jack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these coarse, fat, ill-looking animals, while they lay groaning and snoring heavily amid the remains of their supper.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c10.p15" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="coral.c10.s66"><qs/>"Now, Ralph,"<qe/><sls/> said Jack, in a low whisper, <sle/><qs/>"put a stone in your sling,--a good big one,--and let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you.</s> <s sid="67" id="coral.c10.s67">I'll try to put an arrow into yon little pig."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c10.p18"><s sid="72" id="coral.c10.s72">Thus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang against the hog's flank as if against the head of a drum; but it had no other effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet, with a frightful yell of surprise, and scamper away.</s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c10.s73">At the same instant Jack's bow twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by the ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="coral.c10.p32" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="coral.c10.s92">We now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display of viands we made, when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing fire.</s> <s sid="93" id="coral.c10.s93">There was, first of all, the little pig; then there was the taro- root, and the yam, and the potato, and six plums; and, lastly, the wood- pigeon.</s> <s sid="94" id="coral.c10.s94">To these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had cut from a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after separating from us; <qs/>"and,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"the patch was somewhat in a square form, which convinces me it must have been planted by man."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c11.p17"><s sid="36" id="coral.c11.s36">Now, as we continued on our way, I pondered much over this new discovery, and the singular appearance of these birds, of which Jack could only give us a very slight and vague account; and I began to long to commence to our boat, in order that we might go and inspect them more narrowly.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c11.s37">But by degrees these thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again with the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing through.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c11.p18"><s sid="38" id="coral.c11.s38">The second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the first, at about two-thirds of the way round the island, as we calculated, and we hoped to sleep on the night following at our bower.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c11.s39">I will not here note so particularly all that we said and saw during the course of this second day, as we did not make any further discoveries of great importance.</s> <s sid="40" id="coral.c11.s40">The shore along which we travelled, and the various parts of the woods through which we passed, were similar to those which have been already treated of.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c11.s41">There were one or two observations that we made, however, and these were as follows:--</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c11.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="coral.c11.s42">We saw that, while many of the large fruit-bearing trees grew only in the valleys, and some of them only near the banks of the streams, where the soil was peculiarly rich, the cocoa-nut palm grew in every place whatsoever,--not only on the hill sides, but also on the sea shore, and even, as has been already stated, on the coral reef itself, where the soil, if we may use the name, was nothing better than loose sand mingled with broken shells and coral rock.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c11.s43">So near to the sea, too, did this useful tree grow, that in many places its roots were washed by the spray from the breakers.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c11.s44">Yet we found the trees growing thus on the sands to be quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys, and the fruit as good and refreshing also.</s> <s sid="45" id="coral.c11.s45">Besides this, I noticed that, on the summit of the high mountain, which we once more ascended at a different point from our first ascent, were found abundance of shells and broken coral formations, which Jack and I agreed proved either that this island must have once been under the sea, or that the sea must once have been above the island.</s> <s sid="46" id="coral.c11.s46">In other words, that as shells and coral could not possibly climb to the mountain top, they must have been washed upon it while the mountain top was on a level with the sea.</s> <s sid="47" id="coral.c11.s47">We pondered this very much; and we put to ourselves the question, <qs/>"What raised the island to its present height above the sea?"<qe/></s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c11.s48">But to this we could by no means give to ourselves a satisfactory reply.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c11.s49">Jack thought it might have been blown up by a volcano; and Peterkin said he thought it must have jumped up of its own accord!</s> <s sid="50" id="coral.c11.s50">We also noticed, what had escaped us before, that the solid rocks of which the island was formed were quite different from the live coral rocks on the shore, where the wonderful little insects were continually working.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c11.s51">They seemed, indeed, to be of the sauce material,--a substance like limestone; but, while the coral rocks were quite full of minute cells in which the insects lived, the other rocks inland were hard and solid, without the appearance of cells at all.</s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c11.s52">Our thoughts and conversations on this subject were sometimes so profound that Peterkin said we should certainly get drowned in them at last, even although we were such good divers!</s> <s sid="53" id="coral.c11.s53">Nevertheless we did not allow his pleasantry on this and similar points to deter us from making our notes and observations as we went along.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c11.p20"><s sid="54" id="coral.c11.s54">We found several more droves of hogs in the woods, but abstained from killing any of them, having more than sufficient for our present necessities.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c11.s55">We saw also many of their foot-prints in this neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="56" id="coral.c11.s56">Among these we also observed the footprints of a smaller animal, which we examined with much care, but could form no certain opinion as to them.</s> <s sid="57" id="coral.c11.s57">Peterkin thought they were those of a little dog, but Jack and I thought differently.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c11.s58">We became very curious on this matter, the more so that we observed these foot-prints to lie scattered about in one locality, as if the animal which had made them was wandering round about in a very irregular manner, and without any object in view.</s> <s sid="59" id="coral.c11.s59">Early in the forenoon of our third day we observed these footprints to be much more numerous than ever, and in one particular spot they diverged off into the woods in a regular beaten track, which was, however, so closely beset with bushes, that we pushed through it with difficulty.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c11.s60">We had now become so anxious to find out what animal this was, and where it went to, that we determined to follow the track, and, if possible, clear up the mystery.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c11.s61">Peterkin said, in a bantering tone, that he was sure it would be cleared up as usual in some frightfully simple way, and prove to be no mystery at all!</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c11.p21"><s sid="62" id="coral.c11.s62">The beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by the animal itself, and we concluded that some larger animal had made it, and that the smaller one made use of it.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c11.s63">But everywhere the creeping plants and tangled bushes crossed our path, so that we forced our way along with some difficulty.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c11.s64">Suddenly, as we came upon an open space, we heard a faint cry, and observed a black animal standing in the track before us.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c11.p22" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="coral.c11.s65"><qs/>"A wild-cat!"<qe/> cried Jack, fitting an arrow to his bow, and discharging it so hastily that he missed the animal, and hit the earth about half a foot to one side of it.</s> <s sid="66" id="coral.c11.s66">To our surprise the wild-cat did not fly, but walked slowly towards the arrow, and snuffed at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c11.p26" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="coral.c11.s72"><qs/>"Only think,"<qe/><sls/> said Peterkin, with a suppressed laugh, <sle/><qs/>"of a superannuated wild-cat!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c11.p27"><s sid="73" id="coral.c11.s73">We now found that the poor cat was not only blind, or nearly so, but extremely deaf, as it did not hear our footsteps until we were quite close behind it.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c11.s74">Then it sprang round, and, putting up its back and tail, while the black hair stood all on end, uttered a hoarse mew and a fuff.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c11.p28" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="coral.c11.s75"><qs/>"Poor thing,"<qe/> said Peterkin, gently extending his hand, and endeavouring to pat the cat's head.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c11.s76"><qs/>"Poor pussy; chee, chee, chee; puss, puss, puss; cheetie pussy!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="coral.c11.p29"><s sid="77" id="coral.c11.s77">No sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of anger fled, and, advancing eagerly to Peterkin, it allowed itself to be stroked, and rubbed itself against his legs, purring loudly all the time, and showing every symptom of the most extreme delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="coral.c11.p30" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="coral.c11.s78"><qs/>"It's no more a wild cat than I am!"<qe/> cried Peterkin, taking it in his arms.</s> <s sid="79" id="coral.c11.s79"><qs/>"It's quite tame.</s> <s sid="80" id="coral.c11.s80">Poor pussy, cheetie pussy!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="coral.c11.p31"><s sid="81" id="coral.c11.s81">We now crowded around Peterkin, and were not a little surprised, and, to say truth, a good deal affected, by the sight of the poor animal's excessive joy.</s> <s sid="82" id="coral.c11.s82">It rubbed its head against Peterkin's cheek, licked his chin, and thrust its head almost violently into his neck, while it purred more loudly than I ever heard a cat purr before, and appeared to be so much overpowered by its feelings, that it occasionally mewed and purred almost in the same breath.</s> <s sid="83" id="coral.c11.s83">Such demonstrations of joy and affection led us at once to conclude that this poor cat must have known man before, and we conjectured that it had been left either accidentally or by design on the island many years ago, and was now evincing its extreme joy at meeting once more with human beings.</s> <s sid="84" id="coral.c11.s84">While we were fondling the cat and talking about it, Jack glanced round the open space in the midst of which we stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="coral.c11.p34"><s sid="91" id="coral.c11.s91">About ten yards farther on, the felled trees became more numerous, and the track, diverging to the right, followed for a short space the banks of a stream.</s> <s sid="92" id="coral.c11.s92">Suddenly we came to a spot where once must have been a rude bridge, the stones of which were scattered in the stream, and those on each bank entirely covered over with moss.</s> <s sid="93" id="coral.c11.s93">In silent surprise and expectancy we continued to advance, and, a few yards farther on, beheld, under the shelter of some bread-fruit trees, a small hut or cottage.</s> <s sid="94" id="coral.c11.s94">I cannot hope to convey to my readers a very correct idea of the feelings that affected us on witnessing this unexpected sight.</s> <s sid="95" id="coral.c11.s95">We stood for a long time in silent wonder, for there was a deep and most melancholy stillness about the place that quite overpowered us; and when we did at length speak, it was in subdued whispers, as if we were surrounded by some awful or supernatural influence.</s> <s sid="96" id="coral.c11.s96">Even Peterkin's voice, usually so quick and lively on all occasions, was hushed now; for there was a dreariness about this silent, lonely, uninhabited cottage,--so strange in its appearance, so far away from the usual dwellings of man, so old, decayed, and deserted in its aspect,--that fell upon our spirits like a thick cloud, and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine that had filled us since the commencement of our tour round the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c14.p4"><s sid="6" id="coral.c14.s6">This peculiarity of the tide--its slight rise and fall--had not attracted our observation till some time after our residence on the island.</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c14.s7">Neither had we observed another curious circumstance until we had been some time there.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c14.s8">This was the fact, that the tide rose and fell with constant regularity, instead of being affected by the changes of the moon as in our own country, and as it is in most other parts of the world,--at least in all those parts with which I am acquainted.</s> <s sid="9" id="coral.c14.s9">Every day and every night, at twelve o'clock precisely, the tide is at the full; and at six o'clock every morning and evening it is ebb.</s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c14.s10">I can speak with much confidence on this singular circumstance, as we took particular note of it, and never found it to alter.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c14.s11">Of course, I must admit, we had to guess the hour of twelve midnight, and I think we could do this pretty correctly; but in regard to twelve noon we are quite positive, because we easily found the highest point that the sun reached in the sky by placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the sharp summit of a cliff resting against the sky, just where the sun passed.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c14.p5"><s sid="12" id="coral.c14.s12">Jack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few days of our residence here, and could only account for it by our being so much taken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c14.s13">I have since learned, however, that this want of observation is a sad and very common infirmity of human nature, there being hundreds of persons before whose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every day, who nevertheless are totally ignorant of them.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c14.s14">I therefore have to record my sympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course of conduct which I have now for a long time myself adopted,--namely, the habit of forcing my attention upon _all_ things that go on around me, and of taking some degree of interest in them, whether I feel it naturally or not.</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c14.s15">I suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have very frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has generally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c14.p6"><s sid="16" id="coral.c14.s16">We had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides; and Jack told us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these tides did great good to the world in many ways, particularly in the way of cleansing the shores of the land, and carrying off the filth that was constantly poured into the sea there-from; which, Peterkin suggested, was remarkably _tidy_ of it to do.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c14.s17">Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to joke, however inopportune it might be: which at first we found rather a disagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very agreeable conversation; and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record my disapprobation of this tendency in general: but we became so used to it at last that we found it no interruption whatever; indeed, strange to say, we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment (such is the force of habit), and found the sudden outbursts of mirth, resulting from his humorous disposition, quite natural and refreshing to us in the midst of our more serious conversations.</s> <s sid="18" id="coral.c14.s18">But I must not misrepresent Peterkin.</s> <s sid="19" id="coral.c14.s19">We often found, to our surprise, that he knew many things which we did not; and I also observed that those things which he learned from experience were never forgotten.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c14.s20">From all these things I came at length to understand that things very opposite and dissimilar in themselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as, for example, we three on this our island, although most unlike in many things, when united, made a trio so harmonious that I question if there ever met before such an agreeable triumvirate.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c14.s21">There was, indeed, no note of discord whatever in the symphony we played together on that sweet Coral Island; and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our having been all tuned to the same key, namely, that of _love_!</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c14.s22">Yes, we loved one another with much fervency while we lived on that island; and, for the matter of that, we love each other still.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c14.p7"><s sid="23" id="coral.c14.s23">And while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that just preceded it--namely, the tides--I may here remark on another curious natural phenomenon.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c14.s24">We found that there was little or no twilight in this island.</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c14.s25">We had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at home, which some people think the most delightful part of the day, though for my part I have always preferred sunrise; and when we first landed, we used to sit down on some rocky point or eminence, at the close of our day's work, to enjoy the evening breeze; but no sooner had the sun sunk below the horizon than all became suddenly dark.</s> <s sid="26" id="coral.c14.s26">This rendered it necessary that we should watch the sun when we happened to be out hunting, for to be suddenly left in the dark while in the woods was very perplexing, as, although the stars shone with great beauty and brilliancy, they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs that interlaced above our heads.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c15.p6"><s sid="40" id="coral.c15.s40">While Jack was thus engaged, Peterkin and I sometimes assisted him, but, as our assistance was not much required, we more frequently went a-hunting on the extensive mud-flats at the entrance of the long valley which lay nearest to our bower.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c15.s41">Here we found large flocks of ducks of various kinds, some of them bearing so much resemblance to the wild ducks of our own country that I think they must have been the same.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c15.s42">On these occasions we took the bow and the sling, with both of which we were often successful, though I must confess I was the least so.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c15.s43">Our suppers were thus pleasantly varied, and sometimes we had such a profusion spread out before us that we frequently knew not with which of the dainties to begin.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c15.p7"><s sid="44" id="coral.c15.s44">I must also add, that the poor old cat which we had brought home had always a liberal share of our good things, and so well was it looked after, especially by Peterkin, that it recovered much of its former strength, and seemed to improve in sight as well as hearing.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c16.p10"><s sid="23" id="coral.c16.s23">This huge, ceaseless breaker, to which I have so often alluded, was a much larger and more sublime object than we had at all imagined it to be.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c16.s24">It rose many yards above the level of the sea, and could be seen approaching at some distance from the reef.</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c16.s25">Slowly and majestically it came on, acquiring greater volume and velocity as it advanced, until it assumed the form of a clear watery arch, which sparkled in the bright sun.</s> <s sid="26" id="coral.c16.s26">On it came with resistless and solemn majesty,--the upper edge lipped gently over, and it fell with a roar that seemed as though the heart of Ocean were broken in the crash of tumultuous water, while the foam-clad coral reef appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock!</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c16.p11"><s sid="27" id="coral.c16.s27">We gazed long and wonderingly at this great sight, and it was with difficulty we could tear ourselves away from it.</s> <s sid="28" id="coral.c16.s28">As I have once before mentioned, this wave broke in many places over the reef and scattered some of its spray into the lagoon, but in most places the reef was sufficiently broad and elevated to receive and check its entire force.</s> <s sid="29" id="coral.c16.s29">In many places the coral rocks were covered with vegetation,--the beginning, as it appeared to us, of future islands.</s> <s sid="30" id="coral.c16.s30">Thus, on this reef, we came to perceive how most of the small islands of those seas are formed.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c16.s31">On one part we saw the spray of the breaker washing over the rocks, and millions of little, active, busy creatures continuing the work of building up this living rampart.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c16.s32">At another place, which was just a little too high for the waves to wash over it, the coral insects were all dead; for we found that they never did their work above water.</s> <s sid="33" id="coral.c16.s33">They had faithfully completed the mighty work which their Creator had given them to do, and they were now all dead.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c16.s34">Again, in other spots the ceaseless lashing of the sea had broken the dead coral in pieces, and cast it up in the form of sand.</s> <s sid="35" id="coral.c16.s35">Here sea-birds had alighted, little pieces of sea-weed and stray bits of wood had been washed up, seeds of plants had been carried by the wind and a few lovely blades of bright green had already sprung up, which, when they died, would increase the size and fertility of these emeralds of Ocean.</s> <s sid="36" id="coral.c16.s36">At other places these islets had grown apace, and were shaded by one or two cocoa-nut trees, which grew, literally, in the sand, and were constantly washed by the ocean spray; yet, as I have before remarked, their fruit was most refreshing and sweet to our taste.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c16.p12"><s sid="37" id="coral.c16.s37">Again at this time Jack and I pondered the formation of the large coral islands.</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c16.s38">We could now understand how the low ones were formed, but the larger islands cost us much consideration, yet we could arrive at no certain conclusion on the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c16.p25" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="coral.c16.s59">And to work we went right busily, so that in three days from that time we had set up a mast and sail, with the necessary rigging, in our little boat.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c16.s60">The sail was not, indeed, very handsome to look at, as it was formed of a number of oblong patches of cloth; but we had sewed it well by means of our sail-needle, so that it was strong, which was the chief point.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c16.s61">Jack had also overcome the difficulty about the keel, by pinning to it a _false_ keel.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c16.s62">This was a piece of tough wood, of the same length and width as the real keel, and about five inches deep.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c16.s63">He made it of this depth because the boat would be thereby rendered not only much more safe, but more able to beat against the wind; which, in a sea where the trade-winds blow so long and so steadily in one direction, was a matter of great importance.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c16.s64">This piece of wood was pegged very firmly to the keel; and we now launched our boat with the satisfaction of knowing that when the false keel should be scraped off we could easily put on another; whereas, should the real keel have been scraped away, we could not have renewed it without taking our boat to pieces, which Peterkin said made his <qs/>"marrow quake to think upon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c16.p26"><s sid="65" id="coral.c16.s65">The mast and sail answered excellently; and we now sailed about in the lagoon with great delight, and examined with much interest the appearance of our island from a distance.</s> <s sid="66" id="coral.c16.s66">Also, we gazed into the depths of the water, and watched for hours the gambols of the curious and bright-coloured fish among the corals and sea-weed.</s> <s sid="67" id="coral.c16.s67">Peterkin also made a fishing line, and Jack constructed a number of hooks, some of which were very good, others remarkably bad.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c16.s68">Some of these hooks were made of iron- wood, which did pretty well, the wood being extremely hard, and Jack made them very thick and large.</s> <s sid="69" id="coral.c16.s69">Fish there are not particular.</s> <s sid="70" id="coral.c16.s70">Some of the crooked bones in fish-heads also answered for this purpose pretty well.</s> <s sid="71" id="coral.c16.s71">But that which formed our best and most serviceable hook was the brass finger-ring belonging to Jack.</s> <s sid="72" id="coral.c16.s72">It gave him not a little trouble to manufacture it.</s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c16.s73">First he cut it with the axe; then twisted it into the form of a hook.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c16.s74">The barb took him several hours to cut.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c16.s75">He did it by means of constant sawing with the broken pen-knife.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c16.s76">As for the point, an hour's rubbing on a piece of sandstone made an excellent one.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c16.p28"><s sid="85" id="coral.c16.s85">Sharks did not often appear; but we took care never again to bathe in deep water without leaving one of our number in the boat to give us warning, if he should see a shark approaching.</s> <s sid="86" id="coral.c16.s86">As for the whales, they never came into our lagoon, but we frequently saw them spouting in the deep water beyond the reef.</s> <s sid="87" id="coral.c16.s87">I shall never forget my surprise the first day I saw one of these huge monsters close to me.</s> <s sid="88" id="coral.c16.s88">We had been rambling about on the reef during the morning, and were about to re-embark in our little boat, to return home, when a loud blowing sound caused us to wheel rapidly round.</s> <s sid="89" id="coral.c16.s89">We were just in time to see a shower of spray falling, and the flukes or tail of some monstrous fish disappear in the sea a few hundred yards off.</s> <s sid="90" id="coral.c16.s90">We waited some time to see if he would rise again.</s> <s sid="91" id="coral.c16.s91">As we stood, the sea seemed to open up at our very feet; an immense spout of water was sent with a snort high into the air, and the huge blunt head of a sperm whale arose before us.</s> <s sid="92" id="coral.c16.s92">It was so large that it could easily have taken our little boat, along with ourselves, into its mouth!</s> <s sid="93" id="coral.c16.s93">It plunged slowly back into the sea, like a large ship foundering, and struck the water with its tail so forcibly as to cause a sound like a cannon shot.</s> <s sid="94" id="coral.c16.s94">We also saw a great number of flying fish, although we caught none; and we noticed that they never flew out of the water except when followed by their bitter foe, the dolphin, from whom they thus endeavoured to escape.</s> <s sid="95" id="coral.c16.s95">But of all the fish that we saw, none surprised us so much as those that we used to find in shallow pools after a shower of rain; and this not on account of their appearance, for they were ordinary-looking and very small, but on account of their having descended in a shower of rain!</s> <s sid="96" id="coral.c16.s96">We could account for them in no other way, because the pools in which we found these fish were quite dry before the shower, and at some distance above high-water mark.</s> <s sid="97" id="coral.c16.s97">Jack, however, suggested a cause which seemed to me very probable.</s> <s sid="98" id="coral.c16.s98">We used often to see water-spouts in the sea.</s> <s sid="99" id="coral.c16.s99">A water- spout is a whirling body of water, which rises from the sea like a sharp- pointed pillar.</s> <s sid="100" id="coral.c16.s100">After rising a good way, it is met by a long tongue, which comes down from the clouds; and when the two have joined, they look something like an hour-glass.</s> <s sid="101" id="coral.c16.s101">The water-spout is then carried by the wind, sometimes gently, sometimes with violence, over the sea, sometimes up into the clouds, and then, bursting asunder, it descends in a deluge.</s> <s sid="102" id="coral.c16.s102">This often happens over the land as well as over the sea; and it sometimes does much damage, but frequently it passes gently away.</s> <s sid="103" id="coral.c16.s103">Now, Jack thought that the little fish might perhaps have been carried up in a water-spout, and so sent down again in a shower of rain.</s> <s sid="104" id="coral.c16.s104">But we could not be certain as to this point; yet we thought it likely.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c18.p7"><s sid="20" id="coral.c18.s20">This idea was forced very strongly upon us because we saw nothing in the direction whither the wind was blowing us save the raging billows of the sea; and, indeed, we trembled as we gazed around us, for we were now beyond the shelter of the islands, and it seemed as though any of the huge billows, which curled over in masses of foam, might swallow us up in a moment.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c18.s21">The water, also, began to wash in over our sides, and I had to keep constantly baling, for Jack could not quit the helm nor Peterkin the sail for an instant, without endangering our lives.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c18.s22">In the midst of this distress Jack uttered an exclamation of hope, and pointed towards a low island or rock which lay directly ahead.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c18.s23">It had been hitherto unobserved, owing to the dark clouds that obscured the sky and the blinding spray that seemed to fill the whole atmosphere.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c18.p14"><s sid="41" id="coral.c18.s41">Peterkin's idea was not inappropriate, for, what with the sea roaring in white foam up to our very feet, and the spray flying in white sheets continually over our heads, and the water dripping heavily from the ledge above like a curtain in front of our cave, it did seem to us very much more like being below than above water.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c18.p19"><s sid="60" id="coral.c18.s60">It was with light hearts that we launched forth once more in our little boat and steered away for our island home, which, we were overjoyed to find, was quite visible on the horizon, for we had feared that we had been blown out of sight of it altogether.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c18.s61">As it was a dead calm we had to row during the greater part of the day; but towards the afternoon a fair breeze sprang up, which enabled us to hoist our sail.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c18.s62">We soon passed Penguin Island, and the other island which we had failed to reach on the day the storm commenced; but as we had still enough of provisions, and were anxious to get home, we did not land, to the great disappointment of Peterkin, who seemed to entertain quite an affection for the penguins.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c18.p20"><s sid="63" id="coral.c18.s63">Although the breeze was pretty fresh for several hours, we did not reach the outer reef of our island till night-fall, and before we had sailed more than a hundred yards into the lagoon, the wind died away altogether, so that we had to take to our oars again.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c18.s64">It was late and the moon and stars were shining brightly when we arrived opposite the bower and leaped upon the strand.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c18.s65">So glad were we to be safe back again on our beloved island, that we scarcely took time to drag the boat a short way up the beach, and then ran up to see that all was right at the bower.</s> <s sid="66" id="coral.c18.s66">I must confess, however, that my joy was mingled with a vague sort of fear lest our home had been visited and destroyed during our absence; but on reaching it we found everything just as it had been left, and the poor black cat curled up, sound asleep, on the coral table in front of our humble dwelling.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c19.p5"><s sid="17" id="coral.c19.s17">We often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on the other side of the island, and Peterkin wished much that we had powder and shot, as it would render pig-killing much easier; but, after all, we had become so expert in the use of our sling and bow and spear, that we were independent of more deadly weapons.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="coral.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="coral.c22.s1">I fall into the hands of pirates--How they treated me, and what I said to them--The result of the whole ending in a melancholy separation and in a most unexpected gift.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c22.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c22.s2">My heart seemed to leap into my throat at the words; and, turning round, I beheld a man of immense stature, and fierce aspect regarding me with a smile of contempt.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c22.s3">He was a white man,--that is to say, he was a man of European blood, though his face, from long exposure to the weather, was deeply bronzed.</s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c22.s4">His dress was that of a common seaman, except that he had on a Greek skull-cap, and wore a broad shawl of the richest silk round his waist.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c22.s5">In this shawl were placed two pair of pistols and a heavy cutlass.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c22.s6">He wore a beard and moustache, which, like the locks on his head, were short, curly, and sprinkled with gray hairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c22.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="coral.c22.s7"><qs/>"So, youngster,"<qe/><sls/> he said, with a Sardonic smile, while I felt his grasp tighten on my shoulder, <sle/><qs/>"the villains have been baulked of their prey, have they?</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c22.s8">We shall see, we shall see.</s> <s sid="9" id="coral.c22.s9">Now, you whelp, look yonder."<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="coral.c22.s10">As he spoke, the pirate uttered a shrill whistle.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c22.s11">In a second or two it was answered, and the pirate-boat rowed round the point at the Water Garden, and came rapidly towards us.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c22.s12"><qs/>"Now, go, make a fire on that point; and hark'ee, youngster, if you try to run away, I'll send a quick and sure messenger after you,"<qe/> and he pointed significantly at his pistols.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c22.p4"><s sid="13" id="coral.c22.s13">I obeyed in silence, and as I happened to have the burning-glass in my pocket, a fire was speedily kindled, and a thick smoke ascended into the air.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c22.s14">It had scarcely appeared for two minutes when the boom of a gun rolled over the sea, and, looking up, I saw that the schooner was making for the island again.</s> <s sid="15" id="coral.c22.s15">It now flashed across me that this was a ruse on the part of the pirates, and that they had sent their vessel away, knowing that it would lead us to suppose that they had left altogether.</s> <s sid="16" id="coral.c22.s16">But there was no use of regret now.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c22.s17">I was completely in their power, so I stood helplessly beside the pirate watching the crew of the boat as they landed on the beach.</s> <s sid="18" id="coral.c22.s18">For an instant I contemplated rushing over the cliff into the sea, but this I saw I could not now accomplish, as some of the men were already between me and the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c22.p5"><s sid="19" id="coral.c22.s19">There was a good deal of jesting at the success of their scheme, as the crew ascended the rocks and addressed the man who had captured me by the title of captain.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c22.s20">They were a ferocious set of men, with shaggy beards and scowling brows.</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c22.s21">All of them were armed with cutlasses and pistols, and their costumes were, with trifling variations, similar to that of the captain.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c22.s22">As I looked from one to the other, and observed the low, scowling brows, that never unbent, even when the men laughed, and the mean, rascally expression that sat on each face, I felt that my life hung by a hair.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c22.p6" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="coral.c22.s23"><qs/>"But where are the other cubs?"<qe/> cried one of the men, with an oath that made me shudder.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c22.s24"><qs/>"I'll swear to it there were three, at least, if not more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c22.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="coral.c22.s25"><qs/>"You hear what he says, whelp; where are the other dogs?"<qe/> said the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c22.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="coral.c22.s26"><qs/>"If you mean my companions,"<qe/><sls/> said I, in a low voice, <sle/><qs/>"I won't tell you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c22.p9"><s sid="27" id="coral.c22.s27">A loud laugh burst from the crew at this answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c22.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="coral.c22.s28">The pirate captain looked at me in surprise.</s> <s sid="29" id="coral.c22.s29">Then drawing a pistol from his belt, he cocked it and said, <qs/>"Now, youngster, listen to me.</s> <s sid="30" id="coral.c22.s30">I've no time to waste here.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c22.s31">If you don't tell me all you know, I'll blow your brains out!</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c22.s32">Where are your comrades?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c22.p11"><s sid="33" id="coral.c22.s33">For an instant I hesitated, not knowing what to do in this extremity.</s> <s sid="34" id="coral.c22.s34">Suddenly a thought occurred to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c22.p12" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="coral.c22.s35"><qs/>"Villain,"<qe/><sls/> said I, shaking my clenched fist in his face, <sle/><qs/>"to blow my brains out would make short work of me, and be soon over.</s> <s sid="36" id="coral.c22.s36">Death by drowning is as sure, and the agony prolonged, yet, I tell you to your face, if you were to toss me over yonder cliff into the sea, I would not tell you where my companions are, and I dare you to try me!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c22.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="coral.c22.s37">The pirate captain grew white with rage as I spoke.</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c22.s38"><qs/>"Say you so?"<qe/> cried he, uttering a fierce oath.</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c22.s39"><qs/>"Here, lads, take him by the legs and heave him in,--quick!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c22.p14" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="coral.c22.s40">The men, who were utterly silenced with surprise at my audacity, advanced, and seized me, and, as they carried me towards the cliff, I congratulated myself not a little on the success of my scheme, for I knew that once in the water I should be safe, and could rejoin Jack and Peterkin in the cave.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c22.s41">But my hopes were suddenly blasted by the captain crying out, <qs/>"Hold on, lads, hold on.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c22.s42">We'll give him a taste of the thumb- screws before throwing him to the sharks.</s> <s sid="43" id="coral.c22.s43">Away with him into the boat.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c22.s44">Look alive! the breeze is freshening."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c22.p15"><s sid="45" id="coral.c22.s45">The men instantly raised me shoulder high, and, hurrying down the rocks, tossed me into the bottom of the boat, where I lay for some time stunned with the violence of my fall.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c22.p16"><s sid="46" id="coral.c22.s46">On recovering sufficiently to raise myself on my elbow, I perceived that we were already outside the coral reef, and close alongside the schooner, which was of small size and clipper built.</s> <s sid="47" id="coral.c22.s47">I had only time to observe this much, when I received a severe kick on the side from one of the men, who ordered me, in a rough voice, to jump aboard.</s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c22.s48">Rising hastily I clambered up the side.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c22.s49">In a few minutes the boat was hoisted on deck, the vessel's head put close to the wind, and the Coral Island dropped slowly astern as we beat up against a head sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c22.p17"><s sid="50" id="coral.c22.s50">Immediately after coming aboard, the crew were too busily engaged in working the ship and getting in the boat to attend to me, so I remained leaning against the bulwarks close to the gangway, watching their operations.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c22.s51">I was surprised to find that there were no guns or carronades of any kind in the vessel, which had more of the appearance of a fast-sailing trader than a pirate.</s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c22.s52">But I was struck with the neatness of everything.</s> <s sid="53" id="coral.c22.s53">The brass work of the binnacle and about the tiller, as well as the copper belaying-pins, were as brightly polished as if they had just come from the foundry.</s> <s sid="54" id="coral.c22.s54">The decks were pure white, and smooth.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c22.s55">The masts were clean-scraped and varnished, except at the cross-trees and truck, which were painted black.</s> <s sid="56" id="coral.c22.s56">The standing and running rigging was in the most perfect order, and the sails white as snow.</s> <s sid="57" id="coral.c22.s57">In short, everything, from the single narrow red stripe on her low black hull to the trucks on her tapering masts, evinced an amount of care and strict discipline that would have done credit to a ship of the Royal Navy.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c22.s58">There was nothing lumbering or unseemly about the vessel, excepting, perhaps, a boat, which lay on the deck with its keel up between the fore and main masts.</s> <s sid="59" id="coral.c22.s59">It seemed disproportionately large for the schooner; but, when I saw that the crew amounted to between thirty and forty men, I concluded that this boat was held in reserve, in case of any accident compelling the crew to desert the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c22.p18"><s sid="60" id="coral.c22.s60">As I have before said, the costumes of the men were similar to that of the captain.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c22.s61">But in head gear they differed not only from him but from each other, some wearing the ordinary straw hat of the merchant service, while others wore cloth caps and red worsted night-caps.</s> <s sid="62" id="coral.c22.s62">I observed that all their arms were sent below; the captain only retaining his cutlass and a single pistol in the folds of his shawl.</s> <s sid="63" id="coral.c22.s63">Although the captain was the tallest and most powerful man in the ship, he did not strikingly excel many of his men in this respect, and the only difference that an ordinary observer would have noticed was, a certain degree of open candour, straightforward daring, in the bold, ferocious expression of his face, which rendered him less repulsive than his low-browed associates, but did not by any means induce the belief that he was a hero.</s> <s sid="64" id="coral.c22.s64">This look was, however, the indication of that spirit which gave him the pre-eminence among the crew of desperadoes who called him captain.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c22.s65">He was a lion-like villain; totally devoid of personal fear, and utterly reckless of consequences, and, therefore, a terror to his men, who individually hated him, but unitedly felt it to be their advantage to have him at their head.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c22.p19"><s sid="66" id="coral.c22.s66">But my thoughts soon reverted to the dear companions whom I had left on shore, and as I turned towards the Coral Island, which was now far away to leeward, I sighed deeply, and the tears rolled slowly down my cheeks as I thought that I might never see them more.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c22.p20" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="coral.c22.s67"><qs/>"So you're blubbering, are you, you obstinate whelp?"<qe/> said the deep voice of the captain, as he came up and gave me a box on the ear that nearly felled me to the deck.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c22.s68"><qs/>"I don't allow any such weakness aboard o' this ship.</s> <s sid="69" id="coral.c22.s69">So clap a stopper on your eyes or I'll give you something to cry for."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c22.p21"><s sid="70" id="coral.c22.s70">I flushed with indignation at this rough and cruel treatment, but felt that giving way to anger would only make matters worse, so I made no reply, but took out my handkerchief and dried my eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c22.p22" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="coral.c22.s71"><qs/>"I thought you were made of better stuff,"<qe/><sss/> continued the captain, angrily; <sse/><qs/>"I'd rather have a mad bull-dog aboard than a water-eyed puppy.</s> <s sid="72" id="coral.c22.s72">But I'll cure you, lad, or introduce you to the sharks before long.</s> <s sid="73" id="coral.c22.s73">Now go below, and stay there till I call you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c22.p23"><s sid="74" id="coral.c22.s74">As I walked forward to obey, my eye fell on a small keg standing by the side of the main-mast, on which the word _gunpowder_ was written in pencil.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c22.s75">It immediately flashed across me that, as we were beating up against the wind, anything floating in the sea would be driven on the reef encircling the Coral Island.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c22.s76">I also recollected--for thought is more rapid than the lightning--that my old companions had a pistol.</s> <s sid="77" id="coral.c22.s77">Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, I lifted the keg from the deck and tossed it into the sea!</s> <s sid="78" id="coral.c22.s78">An exclamation of surprise burst from the captain and some of the men who witnessed this act of mine.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c22.p24" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="coral.c22.s79">Striding up to me, and uttering fearful imprecations, the captain raised his hand to strike me, while he shouted, <qs/>"Boy! whelp! what mean you by that?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c22.p25" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="coral.c22.s80"><qs/>"If you lower your hand,"<qe/><sls/> said I, in a loud voice, while I felt the blood rush to my temples, <sle/><qs/>"I'll tell you.</s> <s sid="81" id="coral.c22.s81">Until you do so I'm dumb!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c22.p26"><s sid="82" id="coral.c22.s82">The captain stepped back and regarded me with a look of amazement.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c22.p27" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="coral.c22.s83"><qs/>"Now,"<qe/><sss/> continued I, <sse/><qs/>"I threw that keg into the sea because the wind and waves will carry it to my friends on the Coral Island, who happen to have a pistol, but no powder.</s> <s sid="84" id="coral.c22.s84">I hope that it will reach them soon, and my only regret is that the keg was not a bigger one.</s> <s sid="85" id="coral.c22.s85">Moreover, pirate, you said just now that you thought I was made of better stuff!</s> <s sid="86" id="coral.c22.s86">I don't know what stuff I am made of,--I never thought much about that subject; but I'm quite certain of this, that I am made of such stuff as the like of you shall never tame, though you should do your worst."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c22.p28"><s sid="87" id="coral.c22.s87">To my surprise the captain, instead of flying into a rage, smiled, and, thrusting his hand into the voluminous shawl that encircled his waist, turned on his heel and walked aft, while I went below.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="coral.c22.p29" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="coral.c22.s88">Here, instead of being rudely handled, as I had expected, the men received me with a shout of laughter, and one of them, patting me on the back, said, <qs/>"Well done, lad! you're a brick, and I have no doubt will turn out a rare cove.</s> <s sid="89" id="coral.c22.s89">Bloody Bill, there, was just such a fellow as you are, and he's now the biggest cut-throat of us all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="coral.c22.p30" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="coral.c22.s90"><qs/>"Take a can of beer, lad,"<qe/><sss/> cried another, <sse/><qs/>"and wet your whistle after that speech o' your'n to the captain.</s> <s sid="91" id="coral.c22.s91">If any one o' us had made it, youngster, he would have had no whistle to wet by this time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="coral.c22.p31" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="coral.c22.s92"><qs/>"Stop your clapper, Jack,"<qe/><sss/> vociferated a third; <sse/><qs/>"give the boy a junck o' meat.</s> <s sid="93" id="coral.c22.s93">Don't you see he's a'most goin' to kick the bucket?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="coral.c22.p32" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="coral.c22.s94"><qs/>"And no wonder,"<qe/><sls/> said the first speaker, with an oath, <sle/><qs/>"after the tumble you gave him into the boat.</s> <s sid="95" id="coral.c22.s95">I guess it would have broke _your_ neck if you had got it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="coral.c22.p33"><s sid="96" id="coral.c22.s96">I did indeed feel somewhat faint; which was owing, doubtless, to the combined effects of ill-usage and hunger; for it will be recollected that I had dived out of the cave that morning before breakfast, and it was now near mid-day.</s> <s sid="97" id="coral.c22.s97">I therefore gladly accepted a plate of boiled pork and a yam, which were handed to me by one of the men from the locker on which some of the crew were seated eating their dinner.</s> <s sid="98" id="coral.c22.s98">But I must add that the zest with which I ate my meal was much abated in consequence of the frightful oaths and the terrible language that flowed from the lips of these godless men, even in the midst of their hilarity and good-humour.</s> <s sid="99" id="coral.c22.s99">The man who had been alluded to as Bloody Bill was seated near me, and I could not help wondering at the moody silence he maintained among his comrades.</s> <s sid="100" id="coral.c22.s100">He did indeed reply to their questions in a careless, off-hand tone, but he never volunteered a remark.</s> <s sid="101" id="coral.c22.s101">The only difference between him and the others was his taciturnity and his size, for he was nearly, if not quite, as large a man as the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="coral.c22.p34"><s sid="102" id="coral.c22.s102">During the remainder of the afternoon I was left to my own reflections, which were anything but agreeable, for I could not banish from my mind the threat about the thumb-screws, of the nature and use of which I had a vague but terrible conception.</s> <s sid="103" id="coral.c22.s103">I was still meditating on my unhappy fate when, just after night-fall, one of the watch on deck called down the hatchway,--</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="coral.c22.p35" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="coral.c22.s104"><qs/>"Hallo there! one o' you, tumble up and light the cabin lamp, and send that boy aft to the captain--sharp!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="coral.c22.p36" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="coral.c22.s105"><qs/>"Now then, do you hear, youngster? the captain wants you.</s> <s sid="106" id="coral.c22.s106">Look alive,"<qe/> said Bloody Bill, raising his huge frame from the locker on which he had been asleep for the last two hours.</s> <s sid="107" id="coral.c22.s107">He sprang up the ladder and I instantly followed him, and, going aft, was shown into the cabin by one of the men, who closed the door after me.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="coral.c22.p37"><s sid="108" id="coral.c22.s108">A small silver lamp which hung from a beam threw a dim soft light over the cabin, which was a small apartment, and comfortably but plainly finished.</s> <s sid="109" id="coral.c22.s109">Seated on a camp-stool at the table, and busily engaged in examining a chart of the Pacific, was the captain, who looked up as I entered, and, in a quiet voice, bade me be seated, while he threw down his pencil, and, rising from the table, stretched himself on a sofa at the upper end of the cabin.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="coral.c22.p38" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="coral.c22.s110"><qs/>"Boy,"<qe/><sls/> said he, looking me full in the face, <sle/><qs/>"what is your name?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="coral.c22.p39" type="speech"><s sid="111" id="coral.c22.s111"><qs/>"Ralph Rover,"<qe/> I replied.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="coral.c22.p40" type="speech"><s sid="112" id="coral.c22.s112"><qs/>"Where did you come from, and how came you to be on that island?</s> <s sid="113" id="coral.c22.s113">How many companions had you on it?</s> <s sid="114" id="coral.c22.s114">Answer me, now, and mind you tell no lies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="coral.c22.p41" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="coral.c22.s115"><qs/>"I never tell lies,"<qe/> said I, firmly.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="coral.c22.p42"><s sid="116" id="coral.c22.s116">The captain received this reply with a cold sarcastic smile, and bade me answer his questions.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="coral.c22.p43" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="coral.c22.s117">I then told him the history of myself and my companions from the time we sailed till the day of his visit to the island, taking care, however, to make no mention of the Diamond Cave.</s> <s sid="118" id="coral.c22.s118">After I had concluded, he was silent for a few minutes; then, looking up, he said--<qs/>"Boy, I believe you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="coral.c22.p44"><s sid="119" id="coral.c22.s119">I was surprised at this remark, for I could not imagine why he should not believe me.</s> <s sid="120" id="coral.c22.s120">However, I made no reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="coral.c22.p45" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="coral.c22.s121"><qs/>"And what,"<qe/><sss/> continued the captain, <sse/><qs/>"makes you think that this schooner is a pirate?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="coral.c22.p46" type="speech"><s sid="122" id="coral.c22.s122"><qs/>"The black flag,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"showed me what you are; and if any further proof were wanting I have had it in the brutal treatment I have received at your hands."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="coral.c22.p47" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="coral.c22.s123">The captain frowned as I spoke, but subduing his anger he continued--<qs/>"Boy, you are too bold.</s> <s sid="124" id="coral.c22.s124">I admit that we treated you roughly, but that was because you made us lose time and gave us a good deal of trouble.</s> <s sid="125" id="coral.c22.s125">As to the black flag, that is merely a joke that my fellows play off upon people sometimes in order to frighten them.</s> <s sid="126" id="coral.c22.s126">It is their humour, and does no harm.</s> <s sid="127" id="coral.c22.s127">I am no pirate, boy, but a lawful trader,--a rough one, I grant you, but one can't help that in these seas, where there are so many pirates on the water and such murderous blackguards on the land.</s> <s sid="128" id="coral.c22.s128">I carry on a trade in sandal-wood with the Feejee Islands; and if you choose, Ralph, to behave yourself and be a good boy, I'll take you along with me and give you a good share of the profits.</s> <s sid="129" id="coral.c22.s129">You see I'm in want of an honest boy like you, to look after the cabin and keep the log, and superintend the traffic on shore sometimes.</s> <s sid="130" id="coral.c22.s130">What say you, Ralph, would you like to become a sandal-wood trader?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c34.p2"><s sid="2" id="coral.c34.s2">For a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison, during which dismal time we did not see the face of a human being, except that of the silent savage who brought us our daily food.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c34.p3"><s sid="3" id="coral.c34.s3">There have been one or two seasons in my life during which I have felt as if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away, until death should make me cease to feel the present was such a season.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c34.p4"><s sid="4" id="coral.c34.s4">During the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our hearts every time we heard a foot-fall near the cave--dreading lest it should prove to be that of our executioner.</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c34.s5">But as time dragged heavily on, we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep, irrepressible longing for freedom, that we chafed and fretted in our confinement like tigers.</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c34.s6">Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we actually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to die!</s> <s sid="7" id="coral.c34.s7">But these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled sometimes with brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat in that dark cavern on our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the past, until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c34.s8">But we seldom ventured to touch upon the future.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c34.p5"><s sid="9" id="coral.c34.s9">A few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed; and a scanty supply of yams and taro, brought to us once a-day, constituted our food.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c34.p6" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="coral.c34.s10"><qs/>"Well, Ralph, how have you slept?"<qe/> said Jack, in a listless tone, on rising one morning from his humble couch.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c34.s11"><qs/>"Were you much disturbed by the wind last night?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c34.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="coral.c34.s12"><qs/>"No,"<qe/><sss/> said I; <sse/><qs/>"I dreamed of home all night, and I thought that my mother smiled upon me, and beckoned me to go to her; but I could not, for I was chained."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c34.p8" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="coral.c34.s13"><qs/>"And I dreamed, too,"<qe/><sss/> said Peterkin; <sse/><qs/>"but it was of our happy home on the Coral Island.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c34.s14">I thought we were swimming in the Water Garden; then the savages gave a yell, and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting Cliff, which, somehow or other, changed into this gloomy cavern; and I awoke to find it true."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c34.p9"><s sid="15" id="coral.c34.s15">Peterkin's tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his long imprisonment, that, had I not known it was he who spoke, I should scarcely have recognised it, so sad was it, and so unlike to the merry, cheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear.</s> <s sid="16" id="coral.c34.s16">I pondered this much, and thought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human beings in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one time, and, in a short space, how dark the overshadowing cloud!</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c34.s17">I had no doubt that the Bible would have given me much light and comfort on this subject, if I had possessed one, and I once more had occasion to regret deeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c34.p10" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="coral.c34.s18">While I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of the cave, by saying, in a melancholy tone, <qs/>"Oh, I wonder if we shall ever see our dear island more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c34.p11"><s sid="19" id="coral.c34.s19">His voice trembled, and, covering his face with both hands, he bent down his head and wept.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c34.s20">It was an unusual sight for me to see our once joyous companion in tears, and I felt a burning desire to comfort him; but, alas! what could I say?</s> <s sid="21" id="coral.c34.s21">I could hold out no hope; and although I essayed twice to speak, the words refused to pass my lips.</s> <s sid="22" id="coral.c34.s22">While I hesitated, Jack sat down beside him, and whispered a few words in his ear, while Peterkin threw himself on his friend's breast, and rested his head on his shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="coral.c34.p12"><s sid="23" id="coral.c34.s23">Thus we sat for some time in deep silence.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c34.s24">Soon after, we heard footsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately our jailer entered.</s> <s sid="25" id="coral.c34.s25">We were so much accustomed to his regular visits, however, that we paid little attention to him, expecting that he would set down our meagre fare, as usual, and depart.</s> <s sid="26" id="coral.c34.s26">But, to our surprise, instead of doing so, he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and, going up to Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists, then he did the same to Peterkin and me!</s> <s sid="27" id="coral.c34.s27">For fully five minutes we stood in speechless amazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides.</s> <s sid="28" id="coral.c34.s28">The first thought that rushed into my mind was, that the time had come to put us to death; and although, as I have said before, we actually wished for death in the strength of our despair, now that we thought it drew really near I felt all the natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a chill of horror at the suddenness of our call.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="coral.c34.p13"><s sid="29" id="coral.c34.s29">But I was mistaken.</s> <s sid="30" id="coral.c34.s30">After cutting our bonds, the savage pointed to the cave's mouth, and we marched, almost mechanically, into the open air.</s> <s sid="31" id="coral.c34.s31">Here, to our surprise, we found the teacher standing under a tree, with his hands clasped before him, and the tears trickling down his dark cheeks.</s> <s sid="32" id="coral.c34.s32">On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and clasping him in his arms, exclaimed,--</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="coral.c34.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="coral.c34.s33"><qs/>"Oh! my dear young friend, through the great goodness of God you are free!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="coral.c34.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="coral.c34.s34"><qs/>"Free!"<qe/> cried Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="coral.c34.p16" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="coral.c34.s35"><qs/>"Ay, free,"<qe/><sls/> repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again and again; <sle/><qs/>"free to go and come as you will.</s> <s sid="36" id="coral.c34.s36">The Lord has unloosed the bands of the captive and set the prisoners free.</s> <s sid="37" id="coral.c34.s37">A missionary has been sent to us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!</s> <s sid="38" id="coral.c34.s38">The people are even now burning their gods of wood!</s> <s sid="39" id="coral.c34.s39">Come, my dear friends, and see the glorious sight."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="coral.c34.p17"><s sid="40" id="coral.c34.s40">We could scarcely credit our senses.</s> <s sid="41" id="coral.c34.s41">So long had we been accustomed in our cavern to dream of deliverance, that we imagined for a moment this must surely be nothing more than another vivid dream.</s> <s sid="42" id="coral.c34.s42">Our eyes and minds were dazzled, too, by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded us after our long confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we felt giddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our throbbing bosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend, and beheld the bright foliage of the trees, and heard the cries of the paroquets, and smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs, the truth, that we were really delivered from prison and from death, rushed with overwhelming power into our souls, and, with one accord, while tears sprang to our eyes, we uttered a loud long cheer of joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="coral.c34.p18"><s sid="43" id="coral.c34.s43">It was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who chanced to be near.</s> <s sid="44" id="coral.c34.s44">Running towards us, they shook us by the hand with every demonstration of kindly feeling.</s> <s sid="45" id="coral.c34.s45">They then fell behind, and, forming a sort of procession, conducted us to the dwelling of Tararo.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="coral.c34.p19"><s sid="46" id="coral.c34.s46">The scene that met our eyes here was one that I shall never forget.</s> <s sid="47" id="coral.c34.s47">On a rude bench in front of his house sat the chief.</s> <s sid="48" id="coral.c34.s48">A native stood on his left hand, who, from his dress, seemed to be a teacher.</s> <s sid="49" id="coral.c34.s49">On his right stood an English gentleman, who, I at once and rightly concluded, was a missionary.</s> <s sid="50" id="coral.c34.s50">He was tall, thin, and apparently past forty, with a bald forehead, and thin gray hair.</s> <s sid="51" id="coral.c34.s51">The expression of his countenance was the most winning I ever saw, and his clear gray eye beamed with a look that was frank, fearless, loving, and truthful.</s> <s sid="52" id="coral.c34.s52">In front of the chief was an open space, in the centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols, ready to be set on fire; and around these were assembled thousands of natives, who had come to join in or to witness the unusual sight.</s> <s sid="53" id="coral.c34.s53">A bright smile overspread the missionary's face as he advanced quickly to meet us, and he shook us warmly by the hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="coral.c34.p20" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="coral.c34.s54"><qs/>"I am overjoyed to meet you, my dear young friends,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="55" id="coral.c34.s55"><qs/>"My friend, and your friend, the teacher, has told me your history; and I thank our Father in heaven, with all my heart, that he has guided me to this island, and made me the instrument of saving you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="coral.c34.p21"><s sid="56" id="coral.c34.s56">We thanked the missionary most heartily, and asked him in some surprise how he had succeeded in turning the heart of Tararo in our favour.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="coral.c34.p22" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="coral.c34.s57"><qs/>"I will tell you that at a more convenient time,"<qe/><sss/> he answered, <sse/><qs/>"meanwhile we must not forget the respect due to the chief.</s> <s sid="58" id="coral.c34.s58">He waits to receive you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="coral.c34.p23"><s sid="59" id="coral.c34.s59">In the conversation that immediately followed between us and Tararo, the latter said that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ had been sent to the island, and that to it we were indebted for our freedom.</s> <s sid="60" id="coral.c34.s60">Moreover, he told us that we were at liberty to depart in our schooner whenever we pleased, and that we should be supplied with as much provision as we required.</s> <s sid="61" id="coral.c34.s61">He concluded by shaking hands with us warmly, and performing the ceremony of rubbing noses.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="coral.c34.p24"><s sid="62" id="coral.c34.s62">This was indeed good news to us, and we could hardly find words to express our gratitude to the chief and to the missionary.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="coral.c34.p25" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="coral.c34.s63"><qs/>"And what of Avatea?"<qe/> inquired Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="coral.c34.p26"><s sid="64" id="coral.c34.s64">The missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives in the midst of whom the girl stood.</s> <s sid="65" id="coral.c34.s65">Beside her was a tall, strapping fellow, whose noble mien and air of superiority bespoke him a chief of no ordinary kind.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="coral.c34.p27" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="coral.c34.s66"><qs/>"That youth is her lover.</s> <s sid="67" id="coral.c34.s67">He came this very morning in his war-canoe to treat with Tararo for Avatea.</s> <s sid="68" id="coral.c34.s68">He is to be married in a few days, and afterwards returns to his island home with his bride!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="coral.c34.p28" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="coral.c34.s69"><qs/>"That's capital,"<qe/> said Jack, as he stepped up to the savage and gave him a hearty shake of the hand.</s> <s sid="70" id="coral.c34.s70"><qs/>"I wish you joy, my lad;--and you too, Avatea."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="coral.c34.p29"><s sid="71" id="coral.c34.s71">As Jack spoke, Avatea's lover took him by the hand and led him to the spot where Tararo and the missionary stood, surrounded by most of the chief men of the tribe.</s> <s sid="72" id="coral.c34.s72">The girl herself followed, and stood on his left hand while her lover stood on his right, and, commanding silence, made the following speech, which was translated by the missionary:--</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="coral.c34.p30" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="coral.c34.s73"><qs/>"Young friend, you have seen few years, but your head is old.</s> <s sid="74" id="coral.c34.s74">Your heart also is large and very brave.</s> <s sid="75" id="coral.c34.s75">I and Avatea are your debtors, and we wish, in the midst of this assembly, to acknowledge our debt, and to say that it is one which we can never repay.</s> <s sid="76" id="coral.c34.s76">You have risked your life for one who was known to you only for a few days.</s> <s sid="77" id="coral.c34.s77">But she was a woman in distress, and that was enough to secure to her the aid of a Christian man.</s> <s sid="78" id="coral.c34.s78">We, who live in these islands of the sea, know that the true Christians always act thus.</s> <s sid="79" id="coral.c34.s79">Their religion is one of love and kindness.</s> <s sid="80" id="coral.c34.s80">We thank God that so many Christians have been sent here--we hope many more will come.</s> <s sid="81" id="coral.c34.s81">Remember that I and Avatea will think of you and pray for you and your brave comrades when you are far away."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="coral.c34.p31"><s sid="82" id="coral.c34.s82">To this kind speech Jack returned a short sailor-like reply, in which he insisted that he had only done for Avatea what he would have done for any woman under the sun.</s> <s sid="83" id="coral.c34.s83">But Jack's forte did not lie in speech-making, so he terminated rather abruptly by seizing the chief's hand and shaking it violently, after which he made a hasty retreat.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="coral.c34.p32" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="coral.c34.s84"><qs/>"Now, then, Ralph and Peterkin,"<qe/><sls/> said Jack, as we mingled with the crowd, <sle/><qs/>"it seems to me that the object we came here for having been satisfactorily accomplished, we have nothing more to do but get ready for sea as fast as we can, and hurrah for dear old England!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="coral.c34.p33" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="coral.c34.s85"><qs/>"That's my idea precisely,"<qe/><sls/> said Peterkin, endeavouring to wink, but he had wept so much of late, poor fellow, that he found it difficult; <sle/><qs/>"however, I'm not going away till I see these fellows burn their gods."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="coral.c34.p34"><s sid="86" id="coral.c34.s86">Peterkin had his wish, for, in a few minutes afterwards, fire was put to the pile, the roaring flames ascended, and, amid the acclamations of the assembled thousands, the false gods of Mango were reduced to ashes!</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="coral.c35.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="coral.c35.s2">To part is the lot of all mankind.</s> <s sid="3" id="coral.c35.s3">The world is a scene of constant leave-taking, and the hands that grasp in cordial greeting to-day, are doomed ere long to unite for the last time, when the quivering lips pronounce the word--<qs/>"Farewell."<qe/></s> <s sid="4" id="coral.c35.s4">It is a sad thought, but should we on that account exclude it from our minds?</s> <s sid="5" id="coral.c35.s5">May not a lesson worth learning be gathered in the contemplation of it?</s> <s sid="6" id="coral.c35.s6">May it not, perchance, teach us to devote our thoughts more frequently and attentively to that land where we meet, but part no more?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="coral.c35.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="coral.c35.s7">How many do we part from in this world with a light <qs/>"Good-bye,"<qe/> whom we never see again!</s> <s sid="8" id="coral.c35.s8">Often do I think, in my meditations on this subject, that if we realized more fully the shortness of the fleeting intercourse that we have in this world with many of our fellow-men, we would try more earnestly to do them good, to give them a friendly smile, as it were, in passing (for the longest intercourse on earth is little more than a passing word and glance), and show that we have sympathy with them in the short quick struggle of life, by our kindly words and looks and action.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="coral.c35.p4"><s sid="9" id="coral.c35.s9">The time soon drew near when we were to quit the islands of the South Seas; and, strange though it may appear, we felt deep regret at parting with the natives of the island of Mango; for, after they embraced the Christian faith, they sought, by showing us the utmost kindness, to compensate for the harsh treatment we had experienced at their hands; and we felt a growing affection for the native teachers and the missionary, and especially for Avatea and her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="coral.c35.p5"><s sid="10" id="coral.c35.s10">Before leaving, we had many long and interesting conversations with the missionary, in one of which he told us that he had been making for the island of Raratonga when his native-built sloop was blown out of its course, during a violent gale, and driven to this island.</s> <s sid="11" id="coral.c35.s11">At first the natives refused to listen to what he had to say; but, after a week's residence among them, Tararo came to him and said that he wished to become a Christian, and would burn his idols.</s> <s sid="12" id="coral.c35.s12">He proved himself to be sincere, for, as we have seen, he persuaded all his people to do likewise.</s> <s sid="13" id="coral.c35.s13">I use the word persuaded advisedly; for, like all the other Feejee chiefs, Tararo was a despot and might have commanded obedience to his wishes; but he entered so readily into the spirit of the new faith that he perceived at once the impropriety of using constraint in the propagation of it.</s> <s sid="14" id="coral.c35.s14">He set the example, therefore; and that example was followed by almost every man of the tribe.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="coral.c35.p6"><s sid="15" id="coral.c35.s15">During the short time that we remained at the island, repairing our vessel and getting her ready for sea, the natives had commenced building a large and commodious church, under the superintendence of the missionary, and several rows of new cottages were marked out; so that the place bid fair to become, in a few months, as prosperous and beautiful as the Christian village at the other end of the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="coral.c35.p7"><s sid="16" id="coral.c35.s16">After Avatea was married, she and her husband were sent away, loaded with presents, chiefly of an edible nature.</s> <s sid="17" id="coral.c35.s17">One of the native teachers went with them, for the purpose of visiting still more distant islands of the sea, and spreading, if possible, the light of the glorious gospel there.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="coral.c35.p8"><s sid="18" id="coral.c35.s18">As the missionary intended to remain for several weeks longer, in order to encourage and confirm his new converts, Jack and Peterkin and I held a consultation in the cabin of our schooner,--which we found just as we had left her, for everything that had been taken out of her was restored.</s> <s sid="19" id="coral.c35.s19">We now resolved to delay our departure no longer.</s> <s sid="20" id="coral.c35.s20">The desire to see our beloved native land was strong upon us, and we could not wait.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="coral.c35.p9"><s sid="21" id="coral.c35.s21">Three natives volunteered to go with us to Tahiti, where we thought it likely that we should be able to procure a sufficient crew of sailors to man our vessel; so we accepted their offer gladly.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="coral.c35.p10"><s sid="22" id="coral.c35.s22">It was a bright clear morning when we hoisted the snow-white sails of the pirate schooner and left the shores of Mango.</s> <s sid="23" id="coral.c35.s23">The missionary, and thousands of the natives, came down to bid us God-speed, and to see us sail away.</s> <s sid="24" id="coral.c35.s24">As the vessel bent before a light fair wind, we glided quickly over the lagoon under a cloud of canvass.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="coral.c35.p11"><s sid="25" id="coral.c35.s25">Just as we passed through the channel in the reef the natives gave us a loud cheer; and as the missionary waved his hat, while he stood on a coral rock with his gray hairs floating in the wind, we heard the single word "Farewell" borne faintly over the sea.</s> </p>
