<title>PART I. CHAPTER I. THE BROWN FAMILY</title>
<p pid="1" id="tombrown.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="tombrown.c1.s1"><qs/>"I'm the Poet of White Horse Vale, sir, With liberal notions under my cap."<qe/>--Ballad</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tombrown.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="tombrown.c1.s2">The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray and the pencil of Doyle, within the memory of the young gentlemen who are now matriculating at the universities.</s> <s sid="3" id="tombrown.c1.s3">Notwithstanding the well-merited but late fame which has now fallen upon them, any one at all acquainted with the family must feel that much has yet to be written and said before the British nation will be properly sensible of how much of its greatness it owes to the Browns.</s> <s sid="4" id="tombrown.c1.s4">For centuries, in their quiet, dogged, homespun way, they have been subduing the earth in most English counties, and leaving their mark in American forests and Australian uplands.</s> <s sid="5" id="tombrown.c1.s5">Wherever the fleets and armies of England have won renown, there stalwart sons of the Browns have done yeomen's work.</s> <s sid="6" id="tombrown.c1.s6">With the yew bow and cloth-yard shaft at Cressy and Agincourt--with the brown bill and pike under the brave Lord Willoughby--with culverin and demi-culverin against Spaniards and Dutchmen--with hand-grenade and sabre, and musket and bayonet, under Rodney and St.</s> <s sid="7" id="tombrown.c1.s7">Vincent, Wolfe and Moore, Nelson and Wellington, they have carried their lives in their hands, getting hard knocks and hard work in plenty--which was on the whole what they looked for, and the best thing for them--and little praise or pudding, which indeed they, and most of us, are better without.</s> <s sid="8" id="tombrown.c1.s8">Talbots and Stanleys, St.</s> <s sid="9" id="tombrown.c1.s9">Maurs, and such-like folk, have led armies and made laws time out of mind; but those noble families would be somewhat astounded--if the accounts ever came to be fairly taken--to find how small their work for England has been by the side of that of the Browns.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tombrown.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="tombrown.c1.s10">These latter, indeed, have, until the present generation, rarely been sung by poet, or chronicled by sage.</s> <s sid="11" id="tombrown.c1.s11">They have wanted their sacer vates, having been too solid to rise to the top by themselves, and not having been largely gifted with the talent of catching hold of, and holding on tight to, whatever good things happened to be going--the foundation of the fortunes of so many noble families.</s> <s sid="12" id="tombrown.c1.s12">But the world goes on its way, and the wheel turns, and the wrongs of the Browns, like other wrongs, seem in a fair way to get righted.</s> <s sid="13" id="tombrown.c1.s13">And this present writer, having for many years of his life been a devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover, having the honour of being nearly connected with an eminently respectable branch of the great Brown family, is anxious, so far as in him lies, to help the wheel over, and throw his stone on to the pile.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tombrown.c1.p4"><s sid="14" id="tombrown.c1.s14">However, gentle reader, or simple reader, whichever you may be, lest you should be led to waste your precious time upon these pages, I make so bold as at once to tell you the sort of folk you'll have to meet and put up with, if you and I are to jog on comfortably together.</s> <s sid="15" id="tombrown.c1.s15">You shall hear at once what sort of folk the Browns are--at least my branch of them; and then, if you don't like the sort, why, cut the concern at once, and let you and I cry quits before either of us can grumble at the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tombrown.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="tombrown.c1.s16">In the first place, the Browns are a fighting family.</s> <s sid="17" id="tombrown.c1.s17">One may question their wisdom, or wit, or beauty, but about their fight there can be no question.</s> <s sid="18" id="tombrown.c1.s18">Wherever hard knocks of any kind, visible or invisible, are going; there the Brown who is nearest must shove in his carcass.</s> <s sid="19" id="tombrown.c1.s19">And these carcasses, for the most part, answer very well to the characteristic propensity: they are a squareheaded and snake-necked generation, broad in the shoulder, deep in the chest, and thin in the flank, carrying no lumber.</s> <s sid="20" id="tombrown.c1.s20">Then for clanship, they are as bad as Highlanders; it is amazing the belief they have in one another.</s> <s sid="21" id="tombrown.c1.s21">With them there is nothing like the Browns, to the third and fourth generation.</s> <s sid="22" id="tombrown.c1.s22"><qs/>"Blood is thicker than water,"<qe/> is one of their pet sayings.</s> <s sid="23" id="tombrown.c1.s23">They can't be happy unless they are always meeting one another.</s> <s sid="24" id="tombrown.c1.s24">Never were such people for family gatherings; which, were you a stranger, or sensitive, you might think had better not have been gathered together.</s> <s sid="25" id="tombrown.c1.s25">For during the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in telling one another their minds on whatever subject turns up; and their minds are wonderfully antagonistic, and all their opinions are downright beliefs.</s> <s sid="26" id="tombrown.c1.s26">Till you've been among them some time and understand them, you can't think but that they are quarrelling.</s> <s sid="27" id="tombrown.c1.s27">Not a bit of it.</s> <s sid="28" id="tombrown.c1.s28">They love and respect one another ten times the more after a good set family arguing bout, and go back, one to his curacy, another to his chambers, and another to his regiment, freshened for work, and more than ever convinced that the Browns are the height of company.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tombrown.c1.p6"><s sid="29" id="tombrown.c1.s29">This family training, too, combined with their turn for combativeness, makes them eminently quixotic.</s> <s sid="30" id="tombrown.c1.s30">They can't let anything alone which they think going wrong.</s> <s sid="31" id="tombrown.c1.s31">They must speak their mind about it, annoying all easy-going folk, and spend their time and money in having a tinker at it, however hopeless the job.</s> <s sid="32" id="tombrown.c1.s32">It is an impossibility to a Brown to leave the most disreputable lame dog on the other side of a stile.</s> <s sid="33" id="tombrown.c1.s33">Most other folk get tired of such work.</s> <s sid="34" id="tombrown.c1.s34">The old Browns, with red faces, white whiskers, and bald heads, go on believing and fighting to a green old age.</s> <s sid="35" id="tombrown.c1.s35">They have always a crotchet going, till the old man with the scythe reaps and garners them away for troublesome old boys as they are.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tombrown.c1.p7"><s sid="36" id="tombrown.c1.s36">And the most provoking thing is, that no failures knock them up, or make them hold their hands, or think you, or me, or other sane people in the right.</s> <s sid="37" id="tombrown.c1.s37">Failures slide off them like July rain off a duck's back feathers.</s> <s sid="38" id="tombrown.c1.s38">Jem and his whole family turn out bad, and cheat them one week, and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack; and when he goes to the treadmill, and his wife and children to the workhouse, they will be on the lookout for Bill to take his place.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tombrown.c1.p8"><s sid="39" id="tombrown.c1.s39">However, it is time for us to get from the general to the particular; so, leaving the great army of Browns, who are scattered over the whole empire on which the sun never sets, and whose general diffusion I take to be the chief cause of that empire's stability; let us at once fix our attention upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was hatched, and which dwelt in that portion of the royal county of Berks which is called the Vale of White Horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tombrown.c1.p9"><s sid="40" id="tombrown.c1.s40">Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as far as Swindon.</s> <s sid="41" id="tombrown.c1.s41">Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been aware, soon after leaving the Didcot station, of a fine range of chalk hills running parallel with the railway on the left-hand side as you go down, and distant some two or three miles, more or less, from the line.</s> <s sid="42" id="tombrown.c1.s42">The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill, which you come in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station.</s> <s sid="43" id="tombrown.c1.s43">If you love English scenery, and have a few hours to spare, you can't do better, the next time you pass, than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham station, and make your way to that highest point.</s> <s sid="44" id="tombrown.c1.s44">And those who care for the vague old stories that haunt country-sides all about England, will not, if they are wise, be content with only a few hours' stay; for, glorious as the view is, the neighbourhood is yet more interesting for its relics of bygone times.</s> <s sid="45" id="tombrown.c1.s45">I only know two English neighbourhoods thoroughly, and in each, within a circle of five miles, there is enough of interest and beauty to last any reasonable man his life.</s> <s sid="46" id="tombrown.c1.s46">I believe this to be the case almost throughout the country, but each has a special attraction, and none can be richer than the one I am speaking of and going to introduce you to very particularly, for on this subject I must be prosy; so those that don't care for England in detail may skip the chapter.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tombrown.c1.p10"><s sid="47" id="tombrown.c1.s47">O young England! young England! you who are born into these racing railroad times, when there's a Great Exhibition, or some monster sight, every year, and you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground for three pound ten in a five-weeks' holiday, why don't you know more of your own birthplaces?</s> <s sid="48" id="tombrown.c1.s48">You're all in the ends of the earth, it seems to me, as soon as you get your necks out of the educational collar, for midsummer holidays, long vacations, or what not--going round Ireland, with a return ticket, in a fortnight; dropping your copies of Tennyson on the tops of Swiss mountains; or pulling down the Danube in Oxford racing boats.</s> <s sid="49" id="tombrown.c1.s49">And when you get home for a quiet fortnight, you turn the steam off, and lie on your backs in the paternal garden, surrounded by the last batch of books from Mudie's library, and half bored to death.</s> <s sid="50" id="tombrown.c1.s50">Well, well!</s> <s sid="51" id="tombrown.c1.s51">I know it has its good side.</s> <s sid="52" id="tombrown.c1.s52">You all patter French more or less, and perhaps German; you have seen men and cities, no doubt, and have your opinions, such as they are, about schools of painting, high art, and all that; have seen the pictures of Dresden and the Louvre, and know the taste of sour krout.</s> <s sid="53" id="tombrown.c1.s53">All I say is, you don't know your own lanes and woods and fields.</s> <s sid="54" id="tombrown.c1.s54">Though you may be choke-full of science, not one in twenty of you knows where to find the wood-sorrel, or bee-orchis, which grow in the next wood, or on the down three miles off, or what the bog-bean and wood-sage are good for.</s> <s sid="55" id="tombrown.c1.s55">And as for the country legends, the stories of the old gable-ended farmhouses, the place where the last skirmish was fought in the civil wars, where the parish butts stood, where the last highwayman turned to bay, where the last ghost was laid by the parson, they're gone out of date altogether.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tombrown.c1.p11"><s sid="56" id="tombrown.c1.s56">Now, in my time, when we got home by the old coach, which put us down at the cross-roads with our boxes, the first day of the holidays, and had been driven off by the family coachman, singing "Dulce Domum" at the top of our voices, there we were, fixtures, till black Monday came round.</s> <s sid="57" id="tombrown.c1.s57">We had to cut out our own amusements within a walk or a ride of home.</s> <s sid="58" id="tombrown.c1.s58">And so we got to know all the country folk and their ways and songs and stories by heart, and went over the fields and woods and hills, again and again, till we made friends of them all.</s> <s sid="59" id="tombrown.c1.s59">We were Berkshire, or Gloucestershire, or Yorkshire boys; and you're young cosmopolites, belonging to all countries and no countries.</s> <s sid="60" id="tombrown.c1.s60">No doubt it's all right; I dare say it is.</s> <s sid="61" id="tombrown.c1.s61">This is the day of large views, and glorious humanity, and all that; but I wish back-sword play hadn't gone out in the Vale of White Horse, and that that confounded Great Western hadn't carried away Alfred's Hill to make an embankment.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tombrown.c1.p12"><s sid="62" id="tombrown.c1.s62">But to return to the said Vale of White Horse, the country in which the first scenes of this true and interesting story are laid.</s> <s sid="63" id="tombrown.c1.s63">As I said, the Great Western now runs right through it, and it is a land of large, rich pastures bounded by ox-fences, and covered with fine hedgerow timber, with here and there a nice little gorse or spinney, where abideth poor Charley, having no other cover to which to betake himself for miles and miles, when pushed out some fine November morning by the old Berkshire.</s> <s sid="64" id="tombrown.c1.s64">Those who have been there, and well mounted, only know how he and the stanch little pack who dash after him--heads high and sterns low, with a breast-high scent--can consume the ground at such times.</s> <s sid="65" id="tombrown.c1.s65">There being little ploughland, and few woods, the Vale is only an average sporting country, except for hunting.</s> <s sid="66" id="tombrown.c1.s66">The villages are straggling, queer, old-fashioned places, the houses being dropped down without the least regularity, in nooks and out-of-the-way corners, by the sides of shadowy lanes and footpaths, each with its patch of garden.</s> <s sid="67" id="tombrown.c1.s67">They are built chiefly of good gray stone, and thatched; though I see that within the last year or two the red-brick cottages are multiplying, for the Vale is beginning to manufacture largely both bricks and tiles.</s> <s sid="68" id="tombrown.c1.s68">There are lots of waste ground by the side of the roads in every village, amounting often to village greens, where feed the pigs and ganders of the people; and these roads are old-fashioned, homely roads, very dirty and badly made, and hardly endurable in winter, but still pleasant jog-trot roads running through the great pasture-lands, dotted here and there with little clumps of thorns, where the sleek kine are feeding, with no fence on either side of them, and a gate at the end of each field, which makes you get out of your gig (if you keep one), and gives you a chance of looking about you every quarter of a mile.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tombrown.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="tombrown.c1.s69">One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youth--was it the great Richard Swiveller, or Mr. Stiggins--says, <qs/>"We are born in a vale, and must take the consequences of being found in such a situation."<qe/></s> <s sid="70" id="tombrown.c1.s70">These consequences I, for one, am ready to encounter.</s> <s sid="71" id="tombrown.c1.s71">I pity people who weren't born in a vale.</s> <s sid="72" id="tombrown.c1.s72">I don't mean a flat country; but a vale--that is, a flat country bounded by hills.</s> <s sid="73" id="tombrown.c1.s73">The having your hill always in view if you choose to turn towards him--that's the essence of a vale.</s> <s sid="74" id="tombrown.c1.s74">There he is for ever in the distance, your friend and companion.</s> <s sid="75" id="tombrown.c1.s75">You never lose him as you do in hilly districts.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="tombrown.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="tombrown.c1.s76">And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill!</s> <s sid="77" id="tombrown.c1.s77">There it stands right up above all the rest, nine hundred feet above the sea, and the boldest, bravest shape for a chalk hill that you ever saw.</s> <s sid="78" id="tombrown.c1.s78">Let us go up to the top of him, and see what is to be found there.</s> <s sid="79" id="tombrown.c1.s79">Ay, you may well wonder and think it odd you never heard of this before; but wonder or not, as you please, there are hundreds of such things lying about England, which wiser folk than you know nothing of, and care nothing for.</s> <s sid="80" id="tombrown.c1.s80">Yes, it's a magnificent Roman camp, and no mistake, with gates and ditch and mounds, all as complete as it was twenty years after the strong old rogues left it.</s> <s sid="81" id="tombrown.c1.s81">Here, right up on the highest point, from which they say you can see eleven counties, they trenched round all the table-land, some twelve or fourteen acres, as was their custom, for they couldn't bear anybody to overlook them, and made their eyrie.</s> <s sid="82" id="tombrown.c1.s82">The ground falls away rapidly on all sides.</s> <s sid="83" id="tombrown.c1.s83">Was there ever such turf in the whole world?</s> <s sid="84" id="tombrown.c1.s84">You sink up to your ankles at every step, and yet the spring of it is delicious.</s> <s sid="85" id="tombrown.c1.s85">There is always a breeze in the <qs/>"camp,"<qe/> as it is called; and here it lies, just as the Romans left it, except that cairn on the east side, left by her Majesty's corps of sappers and miners the other day, when they and the engineer officer had finished their sojourn there, and their surveys for the ordnance map of Berkshire.</s> <s sid="86" id="tombrown.c1.s86">It is altogether a place that you won't forget, a place to open a man's soul, and make him prophesy, as he looks down on that great Vale spread out as the garden of the Lord before him, and wave on wave of the mysterious downs behind, and to the right and left the chalk hills running away into the distance, along which he can trace for miles the old Roman road, "the Ridgeway" (<qs/>"the Rudge,"<qe/> as the country folk call it), keeping straight along the highest back of the hills--such a place as Balak brought Balaam to, and told him to prophesy against the people in the valley beneath.</s> <s sid="87" id="tombrown.c1.s87">And he could not, neither shall you, for they are a people of the Lord who abide there.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tombrown.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="tombrown.c1.s88">And now we leave the camp, and descend towards the west, and are on the Ashdown.</s> <s sid="89" id="tombrown.c1.s89">We are treading on heroes.</s> <s sid="90" id="tombrown.c1.s90">It is sacred ground for Englishmen--more sacred than all but one or two fields where their bones lie whitening.</s> <s sid="91" id="tombrown.c1.s91">For this is the actual place where our Alfred won his great battle, the battle of Ashdown ("Aescendum" in the chroniclers), which broke the Danish power, and made England a Christian land.</s> <s sid="92" id="tombrown.c1.s92">The Danes held the camp and the slope where we are standing--the whole crown of the hill, in fact.</s> <s sid="93" id="tombrown.c1.s93"><qs/>"The heathen had beforehand seized the higher ground,"<qe/> as old Asser says, having wasted everything behind them from London, and being just ready to burst down on the fair Vale, Alfred's own birthplace and heritage.</s> <s sid="94" id="tombrown.c1.s94">And up the heights came the Saxons, as they did at the Alma.</s> <s sid="95" id="tombrown.c1.s95"><qs/>"The Christians led up their line from the lower ground.</s> <s sid="96" id="tombrown.c1.s96">There stood also on that same spot a single thorn-tree, marvellous stumpy (which we ourselves with our very own eyes have seen)."<qe/></s> <s sid="97" id="tombrown.c1.s97">Bless the old chronicler!</s> <s sid="98" id="tombrown.c1.s98">Does he think nobody ever saw the "single thorn-tree" but himself?</s> <s sid="99" id="tombrown.c1.s99">Why, there it stands to this very day, just on the edge of the slope, and I saw it not three weeks since--an old single thorn-tree, <qs/>"marvellous stumpy."<qe/></s> <s sid="100" id="tombrown.c1.s100">At least, if it isn't the same tree it ought to have been, for it's just in the place where the battle must have been won or lost--<qs/>"around which, as I was saying, the two lines of foemen came together in battle with a huge shout.</s> <s sid="101" id="tombrown.c1.s101">And in this place one of the two kings of the heathen and five of his earls fell down and died, and many thousands of the heathen side in the same place."<qe/></s> <s sid="102" id="tombrown.c1.s102">* After which crowning mercy, the pious king, that there might never be wanting a sign and a memorial to the country-side, carved out on the northern side of the chalk hill, under the camp, where it is almost precipitous, the great Saxon White Horse, which he who will may see from the railway, and which gives its name to the Vale, over which it has looked these thousand years and more.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="tombrown.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="tombrown.c1.s103">* <qs/>"Pagani editiorem Iocum praeoccupaverant.</s> <s sid="104" id="tombrown.c1.s104">Christiani ab inferiori loco aciem dirigebant.</s> <s sid="105" id="tombrown.c1.s105">Erat quoque in eodem loco unica spinosa arbor, brevis admodum (quam nos ipsi nostris propriis oculis vidimus).</s> <s sid="106" id="tombrown.c1.s106">Circa quam ergo hostiles inter se acies cum ingenti clamore hostiliter conveniunt.</s> <s sid="107" id="tombrown.c1.s107">Quo in loco alter de duobus Paganorum regibus et quinque comites occisi occubuerunt, et multa millia Paganae partis in eodem loco.</s> <s sid="108" id="tombrown.c1.s108">Cecidit illic ergo Boegsceg Rex, et Sidroc ille senex comes, et Sidroc Junior comes, et Obsbern comes,"<qe/> etc.-- Annales Rerum Gestarum AElfredi Magni, Auctore Asserio.</s> <s sid="109" id="tombrown.c1.s109">Recensuit Franciscus Wise.</s> <s sid="110" id="tombrown.c1.s110">Oxford, 1722, p.23.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tombrown.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="111" id="tombrown.c1.s111">Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep and broad gully called <qs/>"the Manger,"<qe/><sls/> into one side of which the hills fall with a series of the most lovely sweeping curves, known as <sle/><qs/>"the Giant's Stairs."<qe/></s> <s sid="112" id="tombrown.c1.s112">They are not a bit like stairs, but I never saw anything like them anywhere else, with their short green turf, and tender bluebells, and gossamer and thistle-down gleaming in the sun and the sheep-paths running along their sides like ruled lines.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tombrown.c1.p18"><s sid="113" id="tombrown.c1.s113">The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragon's Hill, a curious little round self-confident fellow, thrown forward from the range, utterly unlike everything round him.</s> <s sid="114" id="tombrown.c1.s114">On this hill some deliverer of mankind--St.</s> <s sid="115" id="tombrown.c1.s115">George, the country folk used to tell me--killed a dragon.</s> <s sid="116" id="tombrown.c1.s116">Whether it were St.</s> <s sid="117" id="tombrown.c1.s117">George, I cannot say; but surely a dragon was killed there, for you may see the marks yet where his blood ran down, and more by token the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the hillside.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tombrown.c1.p19"><s sid="118" id="tombrown.c1.s118">Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a mile, we come to a little clump of young beech and firs, with a growth of thorn and privet underwood.</s> <s sid="119" id="tombrown.c1.s119">Here you may find nests of the strong down partridge and peewit, but take care that the keeper isn't down upon you; and in the middle of it is an old cromlech, a huge flat stone raised on seven or eight others, and led up to by a path, with large single stones set up on each side.</s> <s sid="120" id="tombrown.c1.s120">This is Wayland Smith's cave, a place of classic fame now; but as Sir Walter has touched it, I may as well let it alone, and refer you to "Kenilworth" for the legend.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tombrown.c7.p22"><s sid="56" id="tombrown.c7.s56">But what was it, after all, which seized and held these three hundred boys, dragging them out of themselves, willing or unwilling, for twenty minutes, on Sunday afternoons?</s> <s sid="57" id="tombrown.c7.s57">True, there always were boys scattered up and down the School, who in heart and head were worthy to hear and able to carry away the deepest and wisest words there spoken.</s> <s sid="58" id="tombrown.c7.s58">But these were a minority always, generally a very small one, often so small a one as to be countable on the fingers of your hand.</s> <s sid="59" id="tombrown.c7.s59">What was it that moved and held us, the rest of the three hundred reckless, childish boys, who feared the Doctor with all our hearts, and very little besides in heaven or earth; who thought more of our sets in the School than of the Church of Christ, and put the traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of boys in our daily life above the laws of God?</s> <s sid="60" id="tombrown.c7.s60">We couldn't enter into half that we heard; we hadn't the knowledge of our own hearts or the knowledge of one another, and little enough of the faith, hope, and love needed to that end.</s> <s sid="61" id="tombrown.c7.s61">But we listened, as all boys in their better moods will listen (ay, and men too for the matter of that), to a man whom we felt to be, with all his heart and soul and strength, striving against whatever was mean and unmanly and unrighteous in our little world.</s> <s sid="62" id="tombrown.c7.s62">It was not the cold, clear voice of one giving advice and warning from serene heights to those who were struggling and sinning below, but the warm, living voice of one who was fighting for us and by our sides, and calling on us to help him and ourselves and one another.</s> <s sid="63" id="tombrown.c7.s63">And so, wearily and little by little, but surely and steadily on the whole, was brought home to the young boy, for the first time, the meaning of his life--that it was no fool's or sluggard's paradise into which he had wandered by chance, but a battlefield ordained from of old, where there are no spectators, but the youngest must take his side, and the stakes are life and death.</s> <s sid="64" id="tombrown.c7.s64">And he who roused this consciousness in them showed them at the same time, by every word he spoke in the pulpit, and by his whole daily life, how that battle was to be fought, and stood there before them their fellow-soldier and the captain of their band--the true sort of captain, too, for a boy's army--one who had no misgivings, and gave no uncertain word of command, and, let who would yield or make truce, would fight the fight out (so every boy felt) to the last gasp and the last drop of blood.</s> <s sid="65" id="tombrown.c7.s65">Other sides of his character might take hold of and influence boys here and there; but it was this thoroughness and undaunted courage which, more than anything else, won his way to the hearts of the great mass of those on whom he left his mark, and made them believe first in him and then in his Master.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tombrown.c7.p23"><s sid="66" id="tombrown.c7.s66">It was this quality above all others which moved such boys as our hero, who had nothing whatever remarkable about him except excess of boyishness--by which I mean animal life in its fullest measure, good nature and honest impulses, hatred of injustice and meanness, and thoughtlessness enough to sink a three-decker.</s> <s sid="67" id="tombrown.c7.s67">And so, during the next two years, in which it was more than doubtful whether he would get good or evil from the School, and before any steady purpose or principle grew up in him, whatever his week's sins and shortcomings might have been, he hardly ever left the chapel on Sunday evenings without a serious resolve to stand by and follow the Doctor, and a feeling that it was only cowardice (the incarnation of all other sins in such a boy's mind) which hindered him from doing so with all his heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tombrown.c7.p24"><s sid="68" id="tombrown.c7.s68">The next day Tom was duly placed in the third form, and began his lessons in a corner of the big School.</s> <s sid="69" id="tombrown.c7.s69">He found the work very easy, as he had been well grounded, and knew his grammar by heart; and, as he had no intimate companions to make him idle (East and his other School-house friends being in the lower fourth, the form above him), soon gained golden opinions from his master, who said he was placed too low, and should be put out at the end of the half-year.</s> <s sid="70" id="tombrown.c7.s70">So all went well with him in School, and he wrote the most flourishing letters home to his mother, full of his own success and the unspeakable delights of a public school.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tombrown.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="tombrown.c7.s74">Tom, as a new boy, was of right excused fagging for the first month, but in his enthusiasm for his new life this privilege hardly pleased him; and East and others of his young friends, discovering this, kindly allowed him to indulge his fancy, and take their turns at night fagging and cleaning studies.</s> <s sid="75" id="tombrown.c7.s75">These were the principal duties of the fags in the house.</s> <s sid="76" id="tombrown.c7.s76">From supper until nine o'clock three fags taken in order stood in the passages, and answered any praepostor who called <qs/>"Fag,"<qe/> racing to the door, the last comer having to do the work.</s> <s sid="77" id="tombrown.c7.s77">This consisted generally of going to the buttery for beer and bread and cheese (for the great men did not sup with the rest, but had each his own allowance in his study or the fifth-form room), cleaning candlesticks and putting in new candles, toasting cheese, bottling beer, and carrying messages about the house; and Tom, in the first blush of his hero-worship, felt it a high privilege to receive orders from and be the bearer of the supper of old Brooke.</s> <s sid="78" id="tombrown.c7.s78">And besides this night-work, each praepostor had three or four fags specially allotted to him, of whom he was supposed to be the guide, philosopher, and friend, and who in return for these good offices had to clean out his study every morning by turns, directly after first lesson and before he returned from breakfast.</s> <s sid="79" id="tombrown.c7.s79">And the pleasure of seeing the great men's studies, and looking at their pictures, and peeping into their books, made Tom a ready substitute for any boy who was too lazy to do his own work.</s> <s sid="80" id="tombrown.c7.s80">And so he soon gained the character of a good-natured, willing fellow, who was ready to do a turn for any one.</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="tombrown.c17.p113" type="speech"><s sid="289" id="tombrown.c17.s289">There he found the eleven at high jinks after supper, Jack Raggles shouting comic songs and performing feats of strength, and was greeted by a chorus of mingled remonstrance at his desertion and joy at his reappearance.</s> <s sid="290" id="tombrown.c17.s290">And falling in with the humour of the evening, he was soon as great a boy as all the rest; and at ten o'clock was chaired round the quadrangle, on one of the hall benches, borne aloft by the eleven, shouting in chorus, <qs/>"For he's a jolly good fellow,"<qe/> while old Thomas, in a melting mood, and the other School-house servants, stood looking on.</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="tombrown.c17.p114"><s sid="291" id="tombrown.c17.s291">And the next morning after breakfast he squared up all the cricketing accounts, went round to his tradesmen and other acquaintance, and said his hearty good-byes; and by twelve o'clock was in the train, and away for London, no longer a school-boy, and divided in his thoughts between hero-worship, honest regrets over the long stage of his life which was now slipping out of sight behind him, and hopes and resolves for the next stage upon which he was entering with all the confidence of a young traveller.</s> </p>
