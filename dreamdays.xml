<title>CHAPTER 1. THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER</title>
<p pid="1" id="dreamdays.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="dreamdays.c1.s1">IN the matter of general culture and attainments, we youngsters stood on pretty level ground.</s> <s sid="2" id="dreamdays.c1.s2">True, it was always happening that one of us would be singled out at any moment, freakishly, and without regard to his own preferences, to wrestle with the inflections of some idiotic language long rightly dead; while another, from some fancied artistic tendency which always failed to justify itself, might be told off without warning to hammer out scales and exercises, and to bedew the senseless keys with tears of weariness or of revolt.</s> <s sid="3" id="dreamdays.c1.s3">But in subjects common to either sex, and held to be necessary even for him whose ambition soared no higher than to crack a whip in a circus-ring--in geography, for instance, arithmetic, or the weary doings of kings and queens--each would have scorned to excel.</s> <s sid="4" id="dreamdays.c1.s4">And, indeed, whatever our individual gifts, a general dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept us all at much the same dead level,--a level of ignorance tempered by insubordination.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dreamdays.c1.p2"><s sid="5" id="dreamdays.c1.s5">Fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects, of healthier tone than those already enumerated, in which we were free to choose for ourselves, and which we would have scorned to consider education; and in these we freely followed each his own particular line, often attaining an amount of special knowledge which struck our ignorant elders as simply uncanny.</s> <s sid="6" id="dreamdays.c1.s6">For Edward, the uniforms, accoutrements, colours, and mottoes of the regiments composing the British Army had a special glamour.</s> <s sid="7" id="dreamdays.c1.s7">In the matter of facings he was simply faultless; among chevrons, badges, medals, and stars, he moved familiarly; he even knew the names of most of the colonels in command; and he would squander sunny hours prone on the lawn, heedless of challenge from bird or beast, poring over a tattered Army List.</s> <s sid="8" id="dreamdays.c1.s8">My own accomplishment was of another character--took, as it seemed to me, a wider and a more untrammelled range.</s> <s sid="9" id="dreamdays.c1.s9">Dragoons might have swaggered in Lincoln green, riflemen might have donned sporrans over tartan trews, without exciting notice or comment from me.</s> <s sid="10" id="dreamdays.c1.s10">But did you seek precise information as to the fauna of the American continent, then you had come to the right shop.</s> <s sid="11" id="dreamdays.c1.s11">Where and why the bison "wallowed"; how beaver were to be trapped and wild turkeys stalked; the grizzly and how to handle him, and the pretty pressing ways of the constrictor,--in fine, the haunts and the habits of all that burrowed, strutted, roared, or wriggled between the Atlantic and the Pacific,--all this knowledge I took for my province.</s> <s sid="12" id="dreamdays.c1.s12">By the others my equipment was fully recognised.</s> <s sid="13" id="dreamdays.c1.s13">Supposing a book with a bear-hunt in it made its way into the house, and the atmosphere was electric with excitement; still, it was necessary that I should first decide whether the slot had been properly described and properly followed up, ere the work could be stamped with full approval.</s> <s sid="14" id="dreamdays.c1.s14">A writer might have won fame throughout the civilised globe for his trappers and his realistic backwoods, and all went for nothing.</s> <s sid="15" id="dreamdays.c1.s15">If his pemmican were not properly compounded I damned his achievement, and it was heard no more of.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dreamdays.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="dreamdays.c1.s16">Harold was hardly old enough to possess a special subject of his own.</s> <s sid="17" id="dreamdays.c1.s17">He had his instincts, indeed, and at bird's-nesting they almost amounted to prophecy.</s> <s sid="18" id="dreamdays.c1.s18">Where we others only suspected eggs, surmised possible eggs, hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood, Harold went straight for the right bush, bough, or hole as if he carried a divining-rod.</s> <s sid="19" id="dreamdays.c1.s19">But this faculty belonged to the class of mere gifts, and was not to be ranked with Edward's lore regarding facings, and mine as to the habits of prairie-dogs, both gained by painful study and extensive travel in those <qs/>"realms of gold,"<qe/> the Army List and Ballantyne.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dreamdays.c1.p4"><s sid="20" id="dreamdays.c1.s20">Selina's subject, quite unaccountably, happened to be naval history.</s> <s sid="21" id="dreamdays.c1.s21">There is no laying down rules as to subjects; you just possess them--or rather, they possess you--and their genesis or protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down.</s> <s sid="22" id="dreamdays.c1.s22">Selina had never so much as seen the sea; but for that matter neither had I ever set foot on the American continent, the by-ways of which I knew so intimately.</s> <s sid="23" id="dreamdays.c1.s23">And just as I, if set down without warning in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, would have been perfectly at home, so Selina, if a genie had dropped her suddenly on Portsmouth Hard, could have given points to most of its frequenters.</s> <s sid="24" id="dreamdays.c1.s24">From the days of Blake down to the death of Nelson (she never condescended further), Selina had taken spiritual part in every notable engagement of the British Navy; and even in the dark days when she had to pick up skirts and flee, chased by an ungallant De Ruyter or Van Tromp, she was yet cheerful in the consciousness that ere long she would be gleefully hammering the fleets of the world, in the glorious times to follow.</s> <s sid="25" id="dreamdays.c1.s25">When that golden period arrived, Selina was busy indeed; and, while loving best to stand where the splinters were flying the thickest, she was also a careful and critical student of seamanship and of manoeuvre.</s> <s sid="26" id="dreamdays.c1.s26">She knew the order in which the great line-of-battle ships moved into action, the vessels they respectively engaged, the moment when each let go its anchor, and which of them had a spring on its cable (while not understanding the phrase, she carefully noted the fact); and she habitually went into an engagement on the quarter-deck of the gallant ship that reserved its fire the longest.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dreamdays.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="dreamdays.c1.s27">At the time of Selina's weird seizure I was unfortunately away from home, on a loathsome visit to an aunt; and my account is therefore feebly compounded from hearsay.</s> <s sid="28" id="dreamdays.c1.s28">It was an absence I never ceased to regret--scoring it up, with a sense of injury, against the aunt.</s> <s sid="29" id="dreamdays.c1.s29">There was a splendid uselessness about the whole performance that specially appealed to my artistic sense.</s> <s sid="30" id="dreamdays.c1.s30">That it should have been Selina, too, who should break out this way--Selina, who had just become a regular subscriber to the <qs/>"Young Ladies' Journal,"<qe/> and who allowed herself to be taken out to strange teas with an air of resignation palpably assumed--this was a special joy, and served to remind me that much of this dreaded convention that was creeping over us might be, after all, only veneer.</s> <s sid="31" id="dreamdays.c1.s31">Edward also was absent, getting licked into shape at school; but to him the loss was nothing.</s> <s sid="32" id="dreamdays.c1.s32">With his stern practical bent he wouldn't have seen any sense in it--to recall one of his favourite expressions.</s> <s sid="33" id="dreamdays.c1.s33">To Harold, however, for whom the gods had always cherished a special tenderness, it was granted, not only to witness, but also, priestlike, to feed the sacred fire itself.</s> <s sid="34" id="dreamdays.c1.s34">And if at the time he paid the penalty exacted by the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the roast, he must ever after, one feels sure, have carried inside him some of the white gladness of the acolyte who, greatly privileged, has been permitted to swing a censer at the sacring of the very Mass.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dreamdays.c1.p6"><s sid="35" id="dreamdays.c1.s35">October was mellowing fast, and with it the year itself; full of tender hints, in woodland and hedgerow, of a course well-nigh completed.</s> <s sid="36" id="dreamdays.c1.s36">From all sides that still afternoon you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal.</s> <s sid="37" id="dreamdays.c1.s37">Preoccupied and possessed, Selina had strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond, where, on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old coach-road on the other, she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy.</s> <s sid="38" id="dreamdays.c1.s38">There she was presently joined by Harold, breathless and very full of his latest grievance.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dreamdays.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="dreamdays.c1.s39"><qs/>"I asked him not to,"<qe/> he burst out.</s> <s sid="40" id="dreamdays.c1.s40"><qs/>"I said if he'd only please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon, and it couldn't matter to _him_, and the pig wouldn't mind, and Edward'd be pleased and everybody'd be happy.</s> <s sid="41" id="dreamdays.c1.s41">But he just said he was very sorry, but bacon didn't wait for nobody.</s> <s sid="42" id="dreamdays.c1.s42">So I told him he was a regular beast, and then I came away.</s> <s sid="43" id="dreamdays.c1.s43">And--and I b'lieve they're doing it now!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dreamdays.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="dreamdays.c1.s44"><qs/>"Yes, he's a beast,"<qe/> agreed Selina, absently.</s> <s sid="45" id="dreamdays.c1.s45">She had forgotten all about the pig-killing.</s> <s sid="46" id="dreamdays.c1.s46">Harold kicked away a freshly thrown-up mole-hill, and prodded down the hole with a stick.</s> <s sid="47" id="dreamdays.c1.s47">From the direction of Farmer Larkin's demesne came a long drawn note of sorrow, a thin cry and appeal, telling that the stout soul of a black Berkshire pig was already faring down the stony track to Hades.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dreamdays.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="dreamdays.c1.s48"><qs/>"D'you know what day it is?"<qe/> said Selina presently, in a low voice, looking far away before her.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dreamdays.c1.p10"><s sid="49" id="dreamdays.c1.s49">Harold did not appear to know, nor yet to care.</s> <s sid="50" id="dreamdays.c1.s50">He had laid open his mole-run for a yard or so, and was still grubbing at it absorbedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dreamdays.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="dreamdays.c1.s51"><qs/>"It's Trafalgar Day,"<qe/><sss/> went on Selina, trancedly; <sse/><qs/>"Trafalgar Day--and nobody cares!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dreamdays.c1.p12"><s sid="52" id="dreamdays.c1.s52">Something in her tone told Harold that he was not behaving quite becomingly.</s> <s sid="53" id="dreamdays.c1.s53">He didn't exactly know in what manner; still, he abandoned his mole-hunt for a more courteous attitude of attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dreamdays.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="dreamdays.c1.s54"><qs/>"Over there,"<qe/><sls/> resumed Selina--she was gazing out in the direction of the old highroad--<sle/><qs/>"over there the coaches used to go by.</s> <s sid="55" id="dreamdays.c1.s55">Uncle Thomas was telling me about it the other day.</s> <s sid="56" id="dreamdays.c1.s56">And the people used to watch for 'em coming, to tell the time by, and p'r'aps to get their parcels.</s> <s sid="57" id="dreamdays.c1.s57">And one morning--they wouldn't be expecting anything different--one morning, first there would be a cloud of dust, as usual, and then the coach would come racing by, and then they would know!</s> <s sid="58" id="dreamdays.c1.s58">For the coach would be dressed in laurel, all laurel from stem to stern!</s> <s sid="59" id="dreamdays.c1.s59">And the coachman would be wearing laurel, and the guard would be wearing laurel, and then they would know, then they would know!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dreamdays.c1.p14"><s sid="60" id="dreamdays.c1.s60">Harold listened in respectful silence.</s> <s sid="61" id="dreamdays.c1.s61">He would much rather have been hunting the mole, who must have been a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him.</s> <s sid="62" id="dreamdays.c1.s62">But he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman; of whom it is one of the principal marks, if not the complete definition, never to show signs of being bored.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dreamdays.c1.p15"><s sid="63" id="dreamdays.c1.s63">Selina rose to her feet, and paced the turf restlessly with a short quarter-deck walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dreamdays.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="dreamdays.c1.s64"><qs/>"Why can't we _do_ something?"<qe/> she burst out presently.</s> <s sid="65" id="dreamdays.c1.s65"><qs/>"_He_--he did everything--why can't we do anything for him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dreamdays.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="dreamdays.c1.s66"><qs/>"_Who_ did everything?"<qe/> inquired Harold, meekly.</s> <s sid="67" id="dreamdays.c1.s67">It was useless wasting further longings on that mole.</s> <s sid="68" id="dreamdays.c1.s68">Like the dead, he travelled fast.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dreamdays.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="dreamdays.c1.s69"><qs/>"Why, Nelson, of course,"<qe/> said Selina, shortly, still looking restlessly around for help or suggestion.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dreamdays.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="dreamdays.c1.s70"><qs/>"But he's--he's _dead_, isn't he?"<qe/> asked Harold, slightly puzzled.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dreamdays.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="dreamdays.c1.s71"><qs/>"What's that got to do with it?"<qe/> retorted his sister, resuming her caged-lion promenade.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dreamdays.c1.p21"><s sid="72" id="dreamdays.c1.s72">Harold was somewhat taken aback.</s> <s sid="73" id="dreamdays.c1.s73">In the case of the pig, for instance, whose last outcry had now passed into stillness, he had considered the chapter as finally closed.</s> <s sid="74" id="dreamdays.c1.s74">Whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store for Edward, that particular pig, at least, would not be a contributor.</s> <s sid="75" id="dreamdays.c1.s75">And now he was given to understand that the situation had not materially changed!</s> <s sid="76" id="dreamdays.c1.s76">He would have to revise his ideas, it seemed.</s> <s sid="77" id="dreamdays.c1.s77">Sitting up on end, he looked towards the garden for assistance in the task.</s> <s sid="78" id="dreamdays.c1.s78">Thence, even as he gazed, a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still air.</s> <s sid="79" id="dreamdays.c1.s79">The gardener had been sweeping that afternoon, and now, an unconscious priest, was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves to the calm-eyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon.</s> <s sid="80" id="dreamdays.c1.s80">Harold was up and off in a moment, forgetting Nelson, forgetting the pig, the mole, the Larkin betrayal, and Selina's strange fever of conscience.</s> <s sid="81" id="dreamdays.c1.s81">Here was fire, real fire, to play with, and that was even better than messing with water, or remodelling the plastic surface of the earth.</s> <s sid="82" id="dreamdays.c1.s82">Of all the toys the world provides for right-minded persons, the original elements rank easily the first.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dreamdays.c1.p24"><s sid="86" id="dreamdays.c1.s86">But Selina sat on where she was, her chin on her fists; and her fancies whirled and drifted, here and there, in curls and eddies, along with the smoke she was watching.</s> <s sid="87" id="dreamdays.c1.s87">As the quick-footed dusk of the short October day stepped lightly over the garden, little red tongues of fire might be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke.</s> <s sid="88" id="dreamdays.c1.s88">Harold, anon staggering under armfuls of leaves, anon stoking vigorously, was discernible only at fitful intervals.</s> <s sid="89" id="dreamdays.c1.s89">It was another sort of smoke that the inner eye of Selina was looking upon,--a smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships; a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the splinter-rip, the shout of the boarding-party, the choking sob of the gunner stretched by his gun; a smoke from out of which at last she saw, as through a riven pall, the radiant spirit of the Victor, crowned with the coronal of a perfect death, leap in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals breathe.</s> <s sid="90" id="dreamdays.c1.s90">The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire; something of the priestess in her stride, something of the devotee in the set purpose of her eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dreamdays.c1.p25"><s sid="91" id="dreamdays.c1.s91">The leaves were well alight by this time, and Harold had just added an old furze bush, which flamed and crackled stirringly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dreamdays.c5.p4"><s sid="12" id="dreamdays.c5.s12">Of course the girls fared badly in this book, and it was not surprising that they preferred the "Pilgrim's Progress" (for instance), where women had a fair show, and there was generally enough of 'em to go round; or a good fairy story, wherein princesses met with a healthy appreciation.</s> <s sid="13" id="dreamdays.c5.s13">But indeed we were all best pleased with a picture wherein the characters just fitted us, in number, sex, and qualifications; and this, to us, stood for artistic merit.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dreamdays.c5.p6"><s sid="18" id="dreamdays.c5.s18">In itself the picture, which--in its ebony and tortoise-shell frame--hung in a corner of the dining-room, had hitherto possessed no special interest for us, and would probably never have been dealt with at all but for a revolt of the girls against a succession of books on sport, in which the illustrator seemed to have forgotten that there were such things as women in the world.</s> <s sid="19" id="dreamdays.c5.s19">Selina accordingly made for it one rainy morning, and announced that she was the lady seated in the centre, whose gown of rich, flowered brocade fell in such straight, severe lines to her feet, whose cloak of dark blue was held by a jewelled clasp, and whose long, fair hair was crowned with a diadem of gold and pearl.</s> <s sid="20" id="dreamdays.c5.s20">Well, we had no objection to that; it seemed fair enough, especially to Edward, who promptly proceeded to "grab" the armour-man who stood leaning on his shield at the lady's right hand.</s> <s sid="21" id="dreamdays.c5.s21">A dainty and delicate armour-man this!</s> <s sid="22" id="dreamdays.c5.s22">And I confess, though I knew it was all right and fair and orderly, I felt a slight pang when he passed out of my reach into Edward's possession.</s> <s sid="23" id="dreamdays.c5.s23">His armour was just the sort I wanted myself--scalloped and fluted and shimmering and spotless; and, though he was but a boy by his beardless face and golden hair, the shattered spear-shaft in his grasp proclaimed him a genuine fighter and fresh from some such agreeable work.</s> <s sid="24" id="dreamdays.c5.s24">Yes, I grudged Edward the armour-man, and when he said I could have the fellow on the other side, I hung back and said I'd think about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dreamdays.c5.p13"><s sid="69" id="dreamdays.c5.s69">It was necessary, no doubt, that grown-up people should dress themselves up and go forth to pay calls.</s> <s sid="70" id="dreamdays.c5.s70">I don't mean that we saw any sense in the practice.</s> <s sid="71" id="dreamdays.c5.s71">It would have been so much more reasonable to stay at home in your old clothes and play.</s> <s sid="72" id="dreamdays.c5.s72">But we recognised that these folk had to do many unaccountable things, and after all it was _their_ life, and not ours, and we were not in a position to criticise.</s> <s sid="73" id="dreamdays.c5.s73">Besides, they had many habits more objectionable than this one, which to us generally meant a free and untrammelled afternoon, wherein to play the devil in our own way.</s> <s sid="74" id="dreamdays.c5.s74">The case was different, however, when the press-gang was abroad, when prayers and excuses were alike disregarded, and we were forced into the service, like native levies impelled toward the foe less by the inherent righteousness of the cause than by the indisputable rifles of their white allies.</s> <s sid="75" id="dreamdays.c5.s75">This was unpardonable and altogether detestable.</s> <s sid="76" id="dreamdays.c5.s76">Still, the thing happened, now and again; and when it did, there was no arguing about it.</s> <s sid="77" id="dreamdays.c5.s77">The order was for the front, and we just had to shut up and march.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dreamdays.c5.p14"><s sid="78" id="dreamdays.c5.s78">Selina, to be sure, had a sneaking fondness for dressing up and paying calls, though she pretended to dislike it, just to keep on the soft side of public opinion.</s> <s sid="79" id="dreamdays.c5.s79">So I thought it extremely mean in her to have the earache on that particular afternoon when Aunt Eliza ordered the pony-carriage and went on the war-path.</s> <s sid="80" id="dreamdays.c5.s80">I was ordered also, in the same breath as the pony-carriage; and, as we eventually trundled off, it seemed to me that the utter waste of that afternoon, for which I had planned so much, could never be made up nor atoned for in all the tremendous stretch of years that still lay before me.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dreamdays.c6.p31"><s sid="135" id="dreamdays.c6.s135">Two of my boats were sunk by the fire from the forts on the shore, and several brave fellows were severely wounded in the hand-to-hand struggle with the French crew for the possession of the frigate.</s> <s sid="136" id="dreamdays.c6.s136">But the bo'sun's admirable strategy, and my own reckless gallantry in securing the French captain at the outset, had the fortunate result of keeping down the death-rate.</s> <s sid="137" id="dreamdays.c6.s137">It was all for the sake of the Princess that I had arranged so comparatively tame a victory.</s> <s sid="138" id="dreamdays.c6.s138">For myself, I rather liked a fair amount of blood-letting, red-hot shot, and flying splinters.</s> <s sid="139" id="dreamdays.c6.s139">But when you have girls about the place, they have got to be considered to a certain extent.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dreamdays.c6.p32"><s sid="140" id="dreamdays.c6.s140">There was another supper-party that night, in my cabin, as soon as we had got well out to sea; and the French captain, who was the guest of the evening, was in the greatest possible form.</s> <s sid="141" id="dreamdays.c6.s141">We became sworn friends, and exchanged invitations to come and stay at each other's homes, and really it was quite difficult to induce him to take his leave.</s> <s sid="142" id="dreamdays.c6.s142">But at last he and his crew were bundled into their boats; and after I had pressed some pirate bullion upon them--delicately, of course, but in a pleasant manner that admitted of no denial--the gallant fellows quite broke down, and we parted, our bosoms heaving with a full sense of each other's magnanimity and good-fellowship.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dreamdays.c6.p33"><s sid="143" id="dreamdays.c6.s143">The next day, which was nearly all taken up with shifting our quarters into the new frigate, so honourably and easily acquired, was a very pleasant one, as everyone who has gone up in the world and moved into a larger house will readily understand.</s> <s sid="144" id="dreamdays.c6.s144">At last I had grim, black guns all along each side, instead of a rotten brass carronade; at last I had a square-rigged ship, with real yards, and a proper quarter-deck.</s> <s sid="145" id="dreamdays.c6.s145">In fact, now that I had soared as high as could be hoped in a single voyage, it seemed about time to go home and cut a dash and show off a bit.</s> <s sid="146" id="dreamdays.c6.s146">The worst of this ocean-theatre was, it held no proper audience.</s> <s sid="147" id="dreamdays.c6.s147">It was hard, of course, to relinquish all the adventures that still lay untouched in these Southern seas.</s> <s sid="148" id="dreamdays.c6.s148">Whaling, for instance, had not yet been entered upon; the joys of exploration, and strange inland cities innocent of the white man, still awaited me; and the book of wrecks and rescues was not yet even opened.</s> <s sid="149" id="dreamdays.c6.s149">But I had achieved a frigate and a Princess, and that was not so bad for a beginning, and more than enough to show off with before those dull unadventurous folk who continued on their mill-horse round at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dreamdays.c6.p34"><s sid="150" id="dreamdays.c6.s150">The voyage home was a record one, so far as mere speed was concerned, and all adventures were scornfully left behind, as we rattled along, for other adventurers who had still their laurels to win.</s> <s sid="151" id="dreamdays.c6.s151">Hardly later than the noon of next day we dropped anchor in Plymouth Sound, and heard the intoxicating clamour of bells, the roar of artillery, and the hoarse cheers of an excited populace surging down to the quays, that told us we were being appreciated at something like our true merits.</s> <s sid="152" id="dreamdays.c6.s152">The Lord Mayor was waiting there to receive us, and with him several Admirals of the Fleet, as we walked down the lane of pushing, enthusiastic Devonians, the Princess and I, and our war-worn, weather-beaten, spoil-laden crew.</s> <s sid="153" id="dreamdays.c6.s153">Everybody was very nice about the French frigate, and the pirate booty, and the scars still fresh on our young limbs; yet I think what I liked best of all was, that they all pronounced the Princess to be a duck, and a peerless, brown-haired darling, and a true mate for a hero, and of the right Princess-breed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="dreamdays.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="dreamdays.c8.s1">IT is a very fine thing to be a real Prince.</s> <s sid="2" id="dreamdays.c8.s2">There are points about a Pirate Chief, and to succeed to the Captaincy of a Robber Band is a truly magnificent thing.</s> <s sid="3" id="dreamdays.c8.s3">But to be an Heir has also about it something extremely captivating.</s> <s sid="4" id="dreamdays.c8.s4">Not only a long-lost heir--an heir of the melodrama, strutting into your hitherto unsuspected kingdom at just the right moment, loaded up with the consciousness of unguessed merit and of rights so long feloniously withheld--but even to be a common humdrum domestic heir is a profession to which few would refuse to be apprenticed.</s> <s sid="5" id="dreamdays.c8.s5">To step from leading-strings and restrictions and one glass of port after dinner, into property and liberty and due appreciation, saved up, polished and varnished, dusted and laid in lavender, all expressly for you--why, even the Princedom and the Robber Captaincy, when their anxieties and responsibilities are considered, have hardly more to offer.</s> <s sid="6" id="dreamdays.c8.s6">And so it will continue to be a problem, to the youth in whom ambition struggles with a certain sensuous appreciation of life's side-dishes, whether the career he is called upon to select out of the glittering knick-knacks that strew the counter had better be that of an heir or an engine-driver.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dreamdays.c8.p2" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="dreamdays.c8.s7">In the case of eldest sons, this problem has a way of solving itself.</s> <s sid="8" id="dreamdays.c8.s8">In childhood, however, the actual heirship is apt to work on the principle of the "Borough-English" of our happier ancestors, and in most cases of inheritance it is the youngest that succeeds.</s> <s sid="9" id="dreamdays.c8.s9">Where the "res" is <qs/>"angusta,"<qe/> and the weekly books are simply a series of stiff hurdles at each of which in succession the paternal legs falter with growing suspicion of their powers to clear the flight, it is in the affair of clothes that the right of succession tells, and "the hard heir strides about the land" in trousers long ago framed for fraternal limbs--_frondes novas et non sua poma_.</s> <s sid="10" id="dreamdays.c8.s10">A bitter thing indeed!</s> <s sid="11" id="dreamdays.c8.s11">Of those pretty silken threads that knit humanity together, high and low, past and present, none is tougher, more pervading, or more iridescent, than the honest, simple pleasure of new clothes.</s> <s sid="12" id="dreamdays.c8.s12">It tugs at the man as it tugs at the woman; the smirk of the well-fitted prince is no different from the smirk of the Sunday-clad peasant; and the veins of the elders tingle with the same thrill that sets their fresh-frocked grandchildren skipping.</s> <s sid="13" id="dreamdays.c8.s13">Never trust people who pretend that they have no joy in their new clothes.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dreamdays.c8.p3"><s sid="14" id="dreamdays.c8.s14">Let not our souls be wrung, however, at contemplation of the luckless urchin cut off by parental penury from the rapture of new clothes.</s> <s sid="15" id="dreamdays.c8.s15">Just as the heroes of his dreams are his immediate seniors, so his heroes' clothes share the glamour, and the reversion of them carries a high privilege--a special thing not sold by Swears and Wells.</s> <s sid="16" id="dreamdays.c8.s16">The sword of Galahad--and of many another hero--arrived on the scene already hoary with history, and the boy rather prefers his trousers to be legendary, famous, haloed by his hero's renown--even though the nap may have altogether vanished in the process.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dreamdays.c8.p4"><s sid="17" id="dreamdays.c8.s17">But, putting clothes aside, there are other matters in which this reversed heirship comes into play.</s> <s sid="18" id="dreamdays.c8.s18">Take the case of Toys.</s> <s sid="19" id="dreamdays.c8.s19">It is hardly right or fitting--and in this the child quite acquiesces--that as he approaches the reverend period of nine or say ten years, he should still be the unabashed and proclaimed possessor of a hoop and a Noah's Ark.</s> <s sid="20" id="dreamdays.c8.s20">The child will quite see the reasonableness of this, and, the goal of his ambition being now a catapult, a pistol, or even a sword-stick, will be satisfied that the titular ownership should lapse to his juniors, so far below him in their kilted or petticoated incompetence.</s> <s sid="21" id="dreamdays.c8.s21">After all, the things are still there, and if relapses of spirit occur, on wet afternoons, one can still (nominally) borrow them and be happy on the floor as of old, without the reproach of being a habitual baby toy-caresser.</s> <s sid="22" id="dreamdays.c8.s22">Also one can pretend it's being done to amuse the younger ones.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dreamdays.c8.p5"><s sid="23" id="dreamdays.c8.s23">None of us, therefore, grumbled when in the natural course of things the nominal ownership of the toys slipped down to Harold, and from him in turn devolved upon Charlotte.</s> <s sid="24" id="dreamdays.c8.s24">The toys were still there; they always had been there and always would be there, and when the nursery door was fast shut there were no Kings or Queens or First Estates in that small Republic on the floor.</s> <s sid="25" id="dreamdays.c8.s25">Charlotte, to be sure, chin-tilted, at last an owner of real estate, might patronise a little at times; but it was tacitly understood that her "title" was only a drawing-room one.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dreamdays.c8.p6"><s sid="26" id="dreamdays.c8.s26">Why does a coming bereavement project no thin faint voice, no shadow of its woe, to warn its happy, heedless victims?</s> <s sid="27" id="dreamdays.c8.s27">Why cannot Olympians ever think it worth while to give some hint of the thunderbolts they are silently forging?</s> <s sid="28" id="dreamdays.c8.s28">And why, oh, why did it never enter any of our thick heads that the day would come when even Charlotte would be considered too matronly for toys?</s> <s sid="29" id="dreamdays.c8.s29">One's so-called education is hammered into one with rulers and with canes.</s> <s sid="30" id="dreamdays.c8.s30">Each fresh grammar or musical instrument, each new historical period or quaint arithmetical rule, is impressed on one by some painful physical prelude.</s> <s sid="31" id="dreamdays.c8.s31">Why does Time, the biggest Schoolmaster, alone neglect premonitory raps, at each stage of his curriculum, on our knuckles or our heads?</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dreamdays.c8.p7"><s sid="32" id="dreamdays.c8.s32">Uncle Thomas was at the bottom of it.</s> <s sid="33" id="dreamdays.c8.s33">This was not the first mine he had exploded under our bows.</s> <s sid="34" id="dreamdays.c8.s34">In his favourite pursuit of fads he had passed in turn from Psychical Research to the White Rose and thence to a Children's Hospital, and we were being daily inundated with leaflets headed by a woodcut depicting Little Annie (of Poplar) sitting up in her little white cot, surrounded by the toys of the nice, kind, rich children.</s> <s sid="35" id="dreamdays.c8.s35">The idea caught on with the Olympians, always open to sentiment of a treacly, woodcut order; and accordingly Charlotte, on entering one day dishevelled and panting, having been pursued by yelling Redskins up to the very threshold of our peaceful home, was curtly informed that her French lessons would begin on Monday, that she was henceforth to cease all pretence of being a trapper or a Redskin on utterly inadequate grounds, and moreover that the whole of her toys were at that moment being finally packed up in a box, for despatch to London, to gladden the lives and bring light into the eyes of London waifs and Poplar Annies.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dreamdays.c8.p8"><s sid="36" id="dreamdays.c8.s36">Naturally enough, perhaps, we others received no official intimation of this grave cession of territory.</s> <s sid="37" id="dreamdays.c8.s37">We were not supposed to be interested.</s> <s sid="38" id="dreamdays.c8.s38">Harold had long ago been promoted to a knife--a recognised, birthday knife.</s> <s sid="39" id="dreamdays.c8.s39">As for me, it was known that I was already given over, heart and soul, to lawless abandoned catapults--catapults which were confiscated weekly for reasons of international complications, but with which Edward kept me steadily supplied, his school having a fine old tradition for excellence in their manufacture.</s> <s sid="40" id="dreamdays.c8.s40">Therefore no one was supposed to be really affected but Charlotte, and even she had already reached Miss Yonge, and should therefore have been more interested in prolific curates and harrowing deathbeds.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dreamdays.c8.p9"><s sid="41" id="dreamdays.c8.s41">Notwithstanding, we all felt indignant, betrayed, and sullen to the verge of mutiny.</s> <s sid="42" id="dreamdays.c8.s42">Though for long we had affected to despise them, these toys, yet they had grown up with us, shared our joys and our sorrows, seen us at our worst, and become part of the accepted scheme of existence.</s> <s sid="43" id="dreamdays.c8.s43">As we gazed at untenanted shelves and empty, hatefully tidy corners, perhaps for the first time for long we began to do them a tardy justice.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dreamdays.c8.p10"><s sid="44" id="dreamdays.c8.s44">There was old Leotard, for instance.</s> <s sid="45" id="dreamdays.c8.s45">Somehow he had come to be sadly neglected of late years--and yet how exactly he always responded to certain moods!</s> <s sid="46" id="dreamdays.c8.s46">He was an acrobat, this Leotard, who lived in a glass-fronted box.</s> <s sid="47" id="dreamdays.c8.s47">His loose-jointed limbs were cardboard, cardboard his slender trunk; and his hands eternally grasped the bar of a trapeze.</s> <s sid="48" id="dreamdays.c8.s48">You turned the box round swiftly five or six times; the wonderful unsolved machinery worked, and Leotard swung and leapt, backwards, forwards, now astride the bar, now flying free; iron-jointed, supple-sinewed, unceasingly novel in his invention of new, unguessable attitudes; while above, below, and around him, a richly-dressed audience, painted in skilful perspective of stalls, boxes, dress-circle, and gallery, watched the thrilling performance with a stolidity which seemed to mark them out as made in Germany.</s> <s sid="49" id="dreamdays.c8.s49">Hardly versatile enough, perhaps, this Leotard; unsympathetic, not a companion for all hours; nor would you have chosen him to take to bed with you.</s> <s sid="50" id="dreamdays.c8.s50">And yet, within his own limits, how fresh, how engrossing, how resourceful and inventive!</s> <s sid="51" id="dreamdays.c8.s51">Well, he was gone, it seemed--merely gone.</s> <s sid="52" id="dreamdays.c8.s52">Never specially cherished while he tarried with us, he had yet contrived to build himself a particular niche of his own.</s> <s sid="53" id="dreamdays.c8.s53">Sunrise and sunset, and the dinner-bell, and the sudden rainbow, and lessons, and Leotard, and the moon through the nursery windows--they were all part of the great order of things, and the displacement of any one item seemed to disorganise the whole machinery.</s> <s sid="54" id="dreamdays.c8.s54">The immediate point was, not that the world would continue to go round as of old, but that Leotard wouldn't.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dreamdays.c8.p11"><s sid="55" id="dreamdays.c8.s55">Yonder corner, now swept and garnished, had been the stall wherein the spotty horse, at the close of each laborious day, was accustomed to doze peacefully the long night through.</s> <s sid="56" id="dreamdays.c8.s56">In days of old each of us in turn had been jerked thrillingly round the room on his precarious back, had dug our heels into his unyielding sides, and had scratched our hands on the tin tacks that secured his mane to his stiffly-curving neck.</s> <s sid="57" id="dreamdays.c8.s57">Later, with increasing stature, we came to overlook his merits as a beast of burden; but how frankly, how good-naturedly, he had recognised the new conditions, and adapted himself to them without a murmur!</s> <s sid="58" id="dreamdays.c8.s58">When the military spirit was abroad, who so ready to be a squadron of cavalry, a horde of Cossacks, or artillery pounding into position?</s> <s sid="59" id="dreamdays.c8.s59">He had even served with honour as a gun-boat, during a period when naval strategy was the only theme; and no false equine pride ever hindered him from taking the part of a roaring locomotive, earth-shaking, clangorous, annihilating time and space.</s> <s sid="60" id="dreamdays.c8.s60">Really it was no longer clear how life, with its manifold emergencies, was to be carried on at all without a fellow like the spotty horse, ready to step in at critical moments and take up just the part required of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dreamdays.c8.p12"><s sid="61" id="dreamdays.c8.s61">In moments of mental depression, nothing is quite so consoling as the honest smell of a painted animal; and mechanically I turned towards the shelf that had been so long the Ararat of our weather beaten Ark.</s> <s sid="62" id="dreamdays.c8.s62">The shelf was empty, the Ark had cast off moorings and sailed away to Poplar, and had taken with it its haunting smell, as well as that pleasant sense of disorder that the best conducted Ark is always able to impart.</s> <s sid="63" id="dreamdays.c8.s63">The sliding roof had rarely been known to close entirely.</s> <s sid="64" id="dreamdays.c8.s64">There was always a pair of giraffe-legs sticking out, or an elephant-trunk, taking from the stiffness of its outline, and reminding us that our motley crowd of friends inside were uncomfortably cramped for room and only too ready to leap in a cascade on the floor and browse and gallop, flutter and bellow and neigh, and be their natural selves again.</s> <s sid="65" id="dreamdays.c8.s65">I think that none of us ever really thought very much of Ham and Shem and Japhet.</s> <s sid="66" id="dreamdays.c8.s66">They were only there because they were in the story, but nobody really wanted them.</s> <s sid="67" id="dreamdays.c8.s67">The Ark was built for the animals, of course--animals with tails, and trunks, and horns, and at least three legs apiece, though some unfortunates had been unable to retain even that number.</s> <s sid="68" id="dreamdays.c8.s68">And in the animals were of course included the birds--the dove, for instance, grey with black wings, and the red-crested woodpecker--or was it a hoopoe?--and the insects, for there was a dear beetle, about the same size as the dove, that held its own with any of the mammalia.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dreamdays.c8.p13"><s sid="69" id="dreamdays.c8.s69">Of the doll-department Charlotte had naturally been sole chief for a long time; if the staff were not in their places to-day, it was not I who had any official right to take notice.</s> <s sid="70" id="dreamdays.c8.s70">And yet one may have been member of a Club for many a year without ever exactly understanding the use and object of the other members, until one enters, some Christmas day or other holiday, and, surveying the deserted armchairs, the untenanted sofas, the barren hat-pegs, realises, with depression, that those other fellows had their allotted functions, after all.</s> <s sid="71" id="dreamdays.c8.s71">Where was old Jerry?</s> <s sid="72" id="dreamdays.c8.s72">Where were Eugenie, Rosa, Sophy, Esmeralda?</s> <s sid="73" id="dreamdays.c8.s73">We had long drifted apart, it was true, we spoke but rarely; perhaps, absorbed in new ambitions, new achievements, I had even come to look down on these conservative, unprogressive members who were so clearly content to remain simply what they were.</s> <s sid="74" id="dreamdays.c8.s74">And now that their corners were unfilled, their chairs unoccupied--well, my eyes were opened and I wanted 'em back!</s> </p>
