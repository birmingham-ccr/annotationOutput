<qe/><title>BOOK 1. THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS CHAPTER 1. THE EVE OF THE WAR</title>
<p pid="1" id="war.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="war.c1.s1">No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.</s> <s sid="2" id="war.c1.s2">With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter.</s> <s sid="3" id="war.c1.s3">It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.</s> <s sid="4" id="war.c1.s4">No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.</s> <s sid="5" id="war.c1.s5">It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.</s> <s sid="6" id="war.c1.s6">At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.</s> <s sid="7" id="war.c1.s7">Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.</s> <s sid="8" id="war.c1.s8">And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="war.c1.p2"><s sid="9" id="war.c1.s9">The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world.</s> <s sid="10" id="war.c1.s10">It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course.</s> <s sid="11" id="war.c1.s11">The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.</s> <s sid="12" id="war.c1.s12">It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="war.c1.p3"><s sid="13" id="war.c1.s13">Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level.</s> <s sid="14" id="war.c1.s14">Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="war.c1.p4"><s sid="15" id="war.c1.s15">The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour.</s> <s sid="16" id="war.c1.s16">Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.</s> <s sid="17" id="war.c1.s17">Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones.</s> <s sid="18" id="war.c1.s18">That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.</s> <s sid="19" id="war.c1.s19">The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts.</s> <s sid="20" id="war.c1.s20">And looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="war.c1.p5"><s sid="21" id="war.c1.s21">And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us.</s> <s sid="22" id="war.c1.s22">The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars.</s> <s sid="23" id="war.c1.s23">Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals.</s> <s sid="24" id="war.c1.s24">To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="war.c1.p6"><s sid="25" id="war.c1.s25">And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races.</s> <s sid="26" id="war.c1.s26">The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.</s> <s sid="27" id="war.c1.s27">Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="war.c1.p7"><s sid="28" id="war.c1.s28">The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity.</s> <s sid="29" id="war.c1.s29">Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century.</s> <s sid="30" id="war.c1.s30">Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well.</s> <s sid="31" id="war.c1.s31">All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="war.c1.p8"><s sid="32" id="war.c1.s32">During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.</s> <s sid="33" id="war.c1.s33">English readers heard of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2.</s> <s sid="34" id="war.c1.s34">I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us.</s> <s sid="35" id="war.c1.s35">Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="war.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="war.c1.s36">The storm burst upon us six years ago now.</s> <s sid="37" id="war.c1.s37">As Mars approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet.</s> <s sid="38" id="war.c1.s38">It had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth.</s> <s sid="39" id="war.c1.s39">This jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve.</s> <s sid="40" id="war.c1.s40">He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, <qs/>"as flaming gases rushed out of a gun."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="war.c1.p10"><s sid="41" id="war.c1.s41">A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.</s> <s sid="42" id="war.c1.s42">Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race.</s> <s sid="43" id="war.c1.s43">I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw.</s> <s sid="44" id="war.c1.s44">He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="war.c1.p11"><s sid="45" id="war.c1.s45">In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it.</s> <s sid="46" id="war.c1.s46">Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.</s> <s sid="47" id="war.c1.s47">Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.</s> <s sid="48" id="war.c1.s48">It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect round.</s> <s sid="49" id="war.c1.s49">But so little it was, so silvery warm--a pin's-head of light!</s> <s sid="50" id="war.c1.s50">It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="war.c1.p12"><s sid="51" id="war.c1.s51">As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.</s> <s sid="52" id="war.c1.s52">Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of void.</s> <s sid="53" id="war.c1.s53">Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="war.c1.p13"><s sid="54" id="war.c1.s54">Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.</s> <s sid="55" id="war.c1.s55">You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night.</s> <s sid="56" id="war.c1.s56">In a telescope it seems far profounder.</s> <s sid="57" id="war.c1.s57">And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.</s> <s sid="58" id="war.c1.s58">I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="war.c1.p14"><s sid="59" id="war.c1.s59">That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet.</s> <s sid="60" id="war.c1.s60">I saw it.</s> <s sid="61" id="war.c1.s61">A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.</s> <s sid="62" id="war.c1.s62">The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="war.c1.p15"><s sid="63" id="war.c1.s63">That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one.</s> <s sid="64" id="war.c1.s64">I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.</s> <s sid="65" id="war.c1.s65">I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.</s> <s sid="66" id="war.c1.s66">Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.</s> <s sid="67" id="war.c1.s67">Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="war.c1.p16"><s sid="68" id="war.c1.s68">He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us.</s> <s sid="69" id="war.c1.s69">His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress.</s> <s sid="70" id="war.c1.s70">He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="war.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="war.c1.s71"><qs/>"The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="war.c1.p18"><s sid="72" id="war.c1.s72">Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each night.</s> <s sid="73" id="war.c1.s73">Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain.</s> <s sid="74" id="war.c1.s74">It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience.</s> <s sid="75" id="war.c1.s75">Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="war.c1.p19"><s sid="76" id="war.c1.s76">Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars.</s> <s sid="77" id="war.c1.s77">The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.</s> <s sid="78" id="war.c1.s78">And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.</s> <s sid="79" id="war.c1.s79">It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did.</s> <s sid="80" id="war.c1.s80">I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days.</s> <s sid="81" id="war.c1.s81">People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.</s> <s sid="82" id="war.c1.s82">For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="war.c1.p20"><s sid="83" id="war.c1.s83">One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.</s> <s sid="84" id="war.c1.s84">It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.</s> <s sid="85" id="war.c1.s85">It was a warm night.</s> <s sid="86" id="war.c1.s86">Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music.</s> <s sid="87" id="war.c1.s87">There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed.</s> <s sid="88" id="war.c1.s88">From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.</s> <s sid="89" id="war.c1.s89">My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky.</s> <s sid="90" id="war.c1.s90">It seemed so safe and tranquil.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>BOOK 1. THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS CHAPTER 2. THE FALLING STAR</title>
<p pid="1" id="war.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="war.c2.s1">Then came the night of the first falling star.</s> <s sid="2" id="war.c2.s2">It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.</s> <s sid="3" id="war.c2.s3">Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.</s> <s sid="4" id="war.c2.s4">Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.</s> <s sid="5" id="war.c2.s5">Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.</s> <s sid="6" id="war.c2.s6">It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="war.c2.p2"><s sid="7" id="war.c2.s7">I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.</s> <s sid="8" id="war.c2.s8">Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed.</s> <s sid="9" id="war.c2.s9">Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound.</s> <s sid="10" id="war.c2.s10">I myself heard nothing of that.</s> <s sid="11" id="war.c2.s11">Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended.</s> <s sid="12" id="war.c2.s12">No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="war.c2.p3"><s sid="13" id="war.c2.s13">But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it.</s> <s sid="14" id="war.c2.s14">Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.</s> <s sid="15" id="war.c2.s15">An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.</s> <s sid="16" id="war.c2.s16">The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="war.c2.p4"><s sid="17" id="war.c2.s17">The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent.</s> <s sid="18" id="war.c2.s18">The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation.</s> <s sid="19" id="war.c2.s19">It had a diameter of about thirty yards.</s> <s sid="20" id="war.c2.s20">He approached the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely.</s> <s sid="21" id="war.c2.s21">It was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.</s> <s sid="22" id="war.c2.s22">A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="war.c2.p5"><s sid="23" id="war.c2.s23">He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival.</s> <s sid="24" id="war.c2.s24">The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm.</s> <s sid="25" id="war.c2.s25">He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.</s> <s sid="26" id="war.c2.s26">He was all alone on the common.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="war.c2.p6"><s sid="27" id="war.c2.s27">Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge of the end.</s> <s sid="28" id="war.c2.s28">It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand.</s> <s sid="29" id="war.c2.s29">A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="war.c2.p7"><s sid="30" id="war.c2.s30">For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly.</s> <s sid="31" id="war.c2.s31">He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="war.c2.p8"><s sid="32" id="war.c2.s32">And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body.</s> <s sid="33" id="war.c2.s33">It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference.</s> <s sid="34" id="war.c2.s34">Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so.</s> <s sid="35" id="war.c2.s35">Then the thing came upon him in a flash.</s> <s sid="36" id="war.c2.s36">The cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out!</s> <s sid="37" id="war.c2.s37">Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="war.c10.p9"><s sid="36" id="war.c10.s36">Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead.</s> <s sid="37" id="war.c10.s37">The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="war.c10.p15"><s sid="59" id="war.c10.s59">Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way.</s> <s sid="60" id="war.c10.s60">Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body.</s> <s sid="61" id="war.c10.s61">It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about.</s> <s sid="62" id="war.c10.s62">Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me.</s> <s sid="63" id="war.c10.s63">And in an instant it was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="war.c10.p16"><s sid="64" id="war.c10.s64">So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="war.c10.p18"><s sid="68" id="war.c10.s68">For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops.</s> <s sid="69" id="war.c10.s69">A thin hail was now beginning, and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again.</s> <s sid="70" id="war.c10.s70">Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed them up.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="war.c10.p19"><s sid="71" id="war.c10.s71">I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below.</s> <s sid="72" id="war.c10.s72">It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="war.c10.p21"><s sid="76" id="war.c10.s76">Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own house.</s> <s sid="77" id="war.c10.s77">I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath.</s> <s sid="78" id="war.c10.s78">It was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="war.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="war.c13.s1">After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself.</s> <s sid="2" id="war.c13.s2">Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that destroyed Lisbon a century ago.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="war.c13.p2"><s sid="3" id="war.c13.s3">But they were in no hurry.</s> <s sid="4" id="war.c13.s4">Cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement.</s> <s sid="5" id="war.c13.s5">And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with furious energy.</s> <s sid="6" id="war.c13.s6">Every minute a fresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.</s> <s sid="7" id="war.c13.s7">And through the charred and desolated area--perhaps twenty square miles altogether--that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach.</s> <s sid="8" id="war.c13.s8">But the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="war.c13.p3"><s sid="9" id="war.c13.s9">It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third cylinders--the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at Pyrford--to their original pit on Horsell Common.</s> <s sid="10" id="war.c13.s10">Over that, above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast fighting-machines and descended into the pit.</s> <s sid="11" id="war.c13.s11">They were hard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="war.c13.p4"><s sid="12" id="war.c13.s12">And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning Weybridge towards London.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="war.c13.p5"><s sid="13" id="war.c13.s13">I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction.</s> <s sid="14" id="war.c13.s14">There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well understand.</s> <s sid="15" id="war.c13.s15">I followed the river, because I considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="war.c13.p6"><s sid="16" id="war.c13.s16">The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.</s> <s sid="17" id="war.c13.s17">Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge.</s> <s sid="18" id="war.c13.s18">Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire.</s> <s sid="19" id="war.c13.s19">It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon.</s> <s sid="20" id="war.c13.s20">Never before had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd.</s> <s sid="21" id="war.c13.s21">A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="war.c15.p7"><s sid="22" id="war.c15.s22">It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube.</s> <s sid="23" id="war.c15.s23">A similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between St.</s> <s sid="24" id="war.c15.s24">George's Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of Ripley.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="war.c15.p8"><s sid="25" id="war.c15.s25">A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher.</s> <s sid="26" id="war.c15.s26">At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford.</s> <s sid="27" id="war.c15.s27">They moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="war.c15.p10"><s sid="30" id="war.c15.s30">The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away towards Staines.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="war.c15.p11"><s sid="31" id="war.c15.s31">The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence.</s> <s sid="32" id="war.c15.s32">It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns.</s> <s sid="33" id="war.c15.s33">Never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still.</s> <s sid="34" id="war.c15.s34">To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the same effect--the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St.</s> <s sid="35" id="war.c15.s35">George's Hill and the woods of Painshill.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="war.c15.p12"><s sid="36" id="war.c15.s36">But facing that crescent everywhere--at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton, Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover--the guns were waiting.</s> <s sid="37" id="war.c15.s37">The signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expectation.</s> <s sid="38" id="war.c15.s38">The Martians had but to advance into the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderous fury of battle.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="war.c15.p13"><s sid="39" id="war.c15.s39">No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how much they understood of us.</s> <s sid="40" id="war.c15.s40">Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined, working together?</s> <s sid="41" id="war.c15.s41">Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees?</s> <s sid="42" id="war.c15.s42">Did they dream they might exterminate us?</s> <s sid="43" id="war.c15.s43">(At that time no one knew what food they needed.)</s> <s sid="44" id="war.c15.s44">A hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape.</s> <s sid="45" id="war.c15.s45">And in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.</s> <s sid="46" id="war.c15.s46">Had they prepared pitfalls?</s> <s sid="47" id="war.c15.s47">Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?</s> <s sid="48" id="war.c15.s48">Would the Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their mighty province of houses?</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="war.c15.p14"><s sid="49" id="war.c15.s49">Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun.</s> <s sid="50" id="war.c15.s50">Another nearer, and then another.</s> <s sid="51" id="war.c15.s51">And then the Martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report that made the ground heave.</s> <s sid="52" id="war.c15.s52">The one towards Staines answered him.</s> <s sid="53" id="war.c15.s53">There was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="war.c15.p15"><s sid="54" id="war.c15.s54">I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury.</s> <s sid="55" id="war.c15.s55">As I did so a second report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards Hounslow.</s> <s sid="56" id="war.c15.s56">I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such evidence of its work.</s> <s sid="57" id="war.c15.s57">But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.</s> <s sid="58" id="war.c15.s58">And there had been no crash, no answering explosion.</s> <s sid="59" id="war.c15.s59">The silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="war.c15.p20"><s sid="70" id="war.c15.s70">Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="war.c15.p21"><s sid="71" id="war.c15.s71">Everything had suddenly become very still.</s> <s sid="72" id="war.c15.s72">Far away to the southeast, marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns.</s> <s sid="73" id="war.c15.s73">But the earthly artillery made no reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="war.c15.p22"><s sid="74" id="war.c15.s74">Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight.</s> <s sid="75" id="war.c15.s75">Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him.</s> <s sid="76" id="war.c15.s76">Some fired only one of these, some two--as in the case of the one we had seen; the one at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.</s> <s sid="77" id="war.c15.s77">These canisters smashed on striking the ground--they did not explode--and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.</s> <s sid="78" id="war.c15.s78">And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathes.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="war.c15.p23"><s sid="79" id="war.c15.s79">It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that, after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do.</s> <s sid="80" id="war.c15.s80">And where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more.</s> <s sid="81" id="war.c15.s81">The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained.</s> <s sid="82" id="war.c15.s82">The vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do.</s> <s sid="83" id="war.c15.s83">It hung together in banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.</s> <s sid="84" id="war.c15.s84">Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="war.c15.p24"><s sid="85" id="war.c15.s85">Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation, that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="war.c15.p25"><s sid="86" id="war.c15.s86">The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness.</s> <s sid="87" id="war.c15.s87">For a day and a half he remained there, weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="war.c15.p26"><s sid="88" id="war.c15.s88">But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground.</s> <s sid="89" id="war.c15.s89">As a rule the Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="war.c15.p27"><s sid="90" id="war.c15.s90">This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had returned.</s> <s sid="91" id="war.c15.s91">From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled, and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there.</s> <s sid="92" id="war.c15.s92">These continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="war.c15.p29"><s sid="95" id="war.c15.s95">So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps' nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the Londonward country.</s> <s sid="96" id="war.c15.s96">The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden.</s> <s sid="97" id="war.c15.s97">All night through their destructive tubes advanced.</s> <s sid="98" id="war.c15.s98">Never once, after the Martian at St.</s> <s sid="99" id="war.c15.s99">George's Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them.</s> <s sid="100" id="war.c15.s100">Wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="war.c16.p1"><s sid="1" id="war.c16.s1">So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning--the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward.</s> <s sid="2" id="war.c16.s2">By ten o'clock the police organisation, and by midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="war.c16.p2"><s sid="3" id="war.c16.s3">All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were being filled.</s> <s sid="4" id="war.c16.s4">People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at two o'clock.</s> <s sid="5" id="war.c16.s5">By three, people were being trampled and crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed, and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="war.c16.p3"><s sid="6" id="war.c16.s6">And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads.</s> <s sid="7" id="war.c16.s7">By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance.</s> <s sid="8" id="war.c16.s8">Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="war.c16.p4"><s sid="9" id="war.c16.s9">After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk Farm--the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace--my brother emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop.</s> <s sid="10" id="war.c16.s10">The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding, with no further injury than a cut wrist.</s> <s sid="11" id="war.c16.s11">The steep foot of Haverstock Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother struck into Belsize Road.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="war.c16.p5"><s sid="12" id="war.c16.s12">So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road, reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the crowd.</s> <s sid="13" id="war.c16.s13">Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious, wondering.</s> <s sid="14" id="war.c16.s14">He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and two motor cars.</s> <s sid="15" id="war.c16.s15">A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the machine became unridable.</s> <s sid="16" id="war.c16.s16">He left it by the roadside and trudged through the village.</s> <s sid="17" id="war.c16.s17">There were shops half opened in the main street of the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning.</s> <s sid="18" id="war.c16.s18">He succeeded in getting some food at an inn.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="war.c16.p8"><s sid="26" id="war.c16.s26">It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward.</s> <s sid="27" id="war.c16.s27">Presently he came upon a stile, and, crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward.</s> <s sid="28" id="war.c16.s28">He passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn.</s> <s sid="29" id="war.c16.s29">He saw few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers.</s> <s sid="30" id="war.c16.s30">He came upon them just in time to save them.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="war.c16.p9"><s sid="31" id="war.c16.s31">He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony's head.</s> <s sid="32" id="war.c16.s32">One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="war.c16.p10"><s sid="33" id="war.c16.s33">My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried towards the struggle.</s> <s sid="34" id="war.c16.s34">One of the men desisted and turned towards him, and my brother, realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="war.c16.p11"><s sid="35" id="war.c16.s35">It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm.</s> <s sid="36" id="war.c16.s36">He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="war.c16.p12"><s sid="37" id="war.c16.s37">Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.</s> <s sid="38" id="war.c16.s38">The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face.</s> <s sid="39" id="war.c16.s39">Then, realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="war.c16.p13"><s sid="40" id="war.c16.s40">Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.</s> <s sid="41" id="war.c16.s41">He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.</s> <s sid="42" id="war.c16.s42">It seems she had had a revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked.</s> <s sid="43" id="war.c16.s43">She fired at six yards' distance, narrowly missing my brother.</s> <s sid="44" id="war.c16.s44">The less courageous of the robbers made off, and his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice.</s> <s sid="45" id="war.c16.s45">They both stopped in sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="war.c16.p16"><s sid="48" id="war.c16.s48">She turned without a word--they were both panting--and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="war.c16.p20"><s sid="55" id="war.c16.s55">So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an unknown lane with these two women.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="war.c16.p23"><s sid="63" id="war.c16.s63">They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became happy in the hedge.</s> <s sid="64" id="war.c16.s64">He told them of his own escape out of London, and all that he knew of these Martians and their ways.</s> <s sid="65" id="war.c16.s65">The sun crept higher in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation.</s> <s sid="66" id="war.c16.s66">Several wayfarers came along the lane, and of these my brother gathered such news as he could.</s> <s sid="67" id="war.c16.s67">Every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight.</s> <s sid="68" id="war.c16.s68">He urged the matter upon them.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="war.c16.p27"><s sid="72" id="war.c16.s72">She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at St.</s> <s sid="73" id="war.c16.s73">Albans or New Barnet.</s> <s sid="74" id="war.c16.s74">My brother thought that was hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains, and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="war.c23.p4"><s sid="16" id="war.c23.s16">Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water, where meadows used to be.</s> <s sid="17" id="war.c23.s17">These fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger.</s> <s sid="18" id="war.c23.s18">At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed.</s> <s sid="19" id="war.c23.s19">Directly this extraordinary growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity.</s> <s sid="20" id="war.c23.s20">Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="war.c23.p5"><s sid="21" id="war.c23.s21">At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham.</s> <s sid="22" id="war.c23.s22">As the water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was concealed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="war.c23.p8"><s sid="32" id="war.c23.s32">Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if their inhabitants slept within.</s> <s sid="33" id="war.c23.s33">The red weed was less abundant; the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper.</s> <s sid="34" id="war.c23.s34">I hunted for food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked.</s> <s sid="35" id="war.c23.s35">I rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="war.c23.p10"><s sid="40" id="war.c23.s40">After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason.</s> <s sid="41" id="war.c23.s41">And in the garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes, sufficient to stay my hunger.</s> <s sid="42" id="war.c23.s42">From this garden one looked down upon Putney and the river.</s> <s sid="43" id="war.c23.s43">The aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed.</s> <s sid="44" id="war.c23.s44">And over all--silence.</s> <s sid="45" id="war.c23.s45">It filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come.</s> </p>
