<p pid="1" id="settlers.c0.p1"><s>CHAPTER ONE.</s> <s>THE SETTLERS AT HOME.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="settlers.c0.p2"><s>Two hundred years ago, the Isle of Axholme was one of the most remarkable places in England.</s> <s>It is not an island in the sea.</s> <s>It is a part of Lincolnshire--a piece of land hilly in the middle, and surrounded by rivers.</s> <s>The Trent runs on the east side of it; and some smaller rivers formerly flowed round the rest of it, joining the Humber to the north.</s> <s>These rivers carried down a great deal of mud with them to the Humber, and the tides of the Humber washed up a great deal of sea-sand into the mouths of the rivers; so that the waters could not for some time flow freely, and were at last prevented from flowing away at all: they sank into the ground, and made a swamp of it--a swamp of many miles round the hilly part of the Isle of Axholme.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="settlers.c0.p3"><s>This swamp was long a very dismal place.</s> <s>Fish, and water-birds, and rats inhabited it: and here and there stood the hut of a fowler; or a peat-stack raised by the people who lived on the hills round, and who obtained their fuel from the peat-lands in the swamp.</s> <s>There were also, sprinkled over the district, a few very small houses--cells belonging to the Abbey of Saint Mary, at York.</s> <s>To these cells some of the monks from Saint Mary's had been fond of retiring, in old times, for meditation and prayer, and doing good in the district round; but when the soil became so swampy as to give them the ague as often as they paid a visit to these cells, the monks left off their practice of retiring hither; and their little dwellings stood empty, to be gradually overgrown with green moss and lank weeds, which no hand cleared away.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="settlers.c0.p4"><s>At last a Dutchman, having seen what wonders were done in his own country by good draining, thought he could render this district fit to be inhabited and cultivated; and he made a bargain with the king about it.</s> <s>After spending much money, and taking great pains, he succeeded.</s> <s>He drew the waters off into new channels, and kept them there by sluices, and by carefully watching the embankments he had raised.</s> <s>The land which was left dry was manured and cultivated, till, instead of a reedy and mossy swamp, there were fields of clover and of corn, and meadows of the finest grass, with cattle and sheep grazing in large numbers.</s> <s>The dwellings that were still standing were made into farm-houses, and new farmhouses were built.</s> <s>A church here, and a chapel there was cleaned, and warmed, and painted, and opened for worship; and good roads crossed the district into all the counties near.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="settlers.c0.p5"><s>Instead of being pleased with this change, the people of the country were angry and discontented.</s> <s>Those who lived near had been long accustomed to fishing and fowling in the swamp, without paying any rent, or having to ask anybody's leave.</s> <s>They had no mind now to settle to the regular toilsome business of farming,--and to be under a landlord, to whom they must pay rent.</s> <s>Probably, too, they knew nothing about farming, and would have failed in it if they had tried.</s> <s>Thus far they were not to be blamed.</s> <s>But nothing can exceed the malignity with which they treated the tenants who did settle in the isle, and the spiteful spirit which they showed towards them, on every occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="settlers.c0.p6"><s>These tenants were chiefly foreigners.</s> <s>There was a civil war in England at that time: and the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire people were so much engaged in fighting for King Charles or for the Parliament, that fewer persons were at liberty to undertake new farms than there would have been in a time of peace.</s> <s>When the Dutchman and his companions found that the English were not disposed to occupy the Levels (as the drained lands were called), they encouraged some of their own countrymen to come over.</s> <s>With them arrived some few Frenchmen, who had been driven from France into Holland, on account of their being Protestants.</s> <s>From first to last, there were about two hundred families, Dutch and French, settled in the Levels.</s> <s>Some were collected into a village, and had a chapel opened, where a pastor of their own performed service for them.</s> <s>Others were scattered over the district, living just where their occupations required them to settle.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="settlers.c0.p7"><s>All these foreigners were subject to bad treatment from their neighbours; but the stragglers were the worst off; because it was easiest to tease and injure those who lived alone.</s> <s>The disappointed fishers and fowlers gave other reasons for their own conduct, besides that of being nearly deprived of their fishing and fowling.</s> <s>These reasons were all bad, as reasons for hating always are.</s> <s>One excuse was that the new settlers were foreigners--as if those who were far from their own land did not need particular hospitality and kindness.</s> <s>Another plea was that they were connected with the king, by being settled on the lands which he had bargained to have drained: so that all who sided with the parliament ought to injure the new tenants, in order to annoy the king.</s> <s>If the settlers had tried to serve the king by injuring his enemies, this last reason might have passed in a time of war.</s> <s>But it was not so.</s> <s>It is probable that the foreigners did not understand the quarrel.</s> <s>At any rate, they took no part in it.</s> <s>All they desired was to be left in peace, to cultivate the lands they paid rent for.</s> <s>But instead of peace, they had little but persecution.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="settlers.c0.p8"><s>One of these settlers, Mr Linacre, was not himself a farmer.</s> <s>He supplied the farmers of the district with a manure of a particular kind, which suited some of the richest soils they cultivated.</s> <s>He found, in the red soil of the isle, a large mass of that white earth, called gypsum, which, when wetted and burnt, makes plaster of Paris; and which, when ground, makes a fine manure for some soils, as the careful Dutchmen well knew.</s> <s>Mr Linacre set up a windmill on a little eminence which rose out of the Level, just high enough to catch the wind; and there he ground the gypsum which he dug from the neighbouring patch or quarry.</s> <s>He had to build some out-houses, but not a dwelling-house; for, near his mill, with just space enough for a good garden between, was one of the largest of the old cells of the monks of Saint Mary's, so well built of stone, and so comfortably arranged, that Mr Linacre had little to do but to have it cleaned and furnished, and the windows and doors made new, to fit it for the residence of his wife and children, and a servant.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="settlers.c0.p9"><s>This building was round, and had three rooms below, and three over them.</s> <s>A staircase of stone was in the very middle, winding round, like a corkscrew,--leading to the upper rooms, and out upon the roof, from which there was a beautiful view,--quite as far as the Humber to the north-east, and to the circle of hills on every other side.</s> <s>Each of the rooms below had a door to the open air, and another to the staircase;-- very unlike modern houses, and not so fit as they to keep out wind and cold.</s> <s>But for this, the dwelling would have been very warm, for the walls were of thick stone; and the fire-places were so large, that it seemed as if the monks had been fond of good fires.</s> <s>Two of these lower rooms opened into the garden; and the third, the kitchen, into the yard;--so that the maid, Ailwin, had not far to go to milk the cow and feed the poultry.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="settlers.c0.p10"><s>Mrs Linacre was as neat in the management of her house as people from Holland usually are; and she did not like that the sitting-room, where her husband had his meals, and spent his evenings, should be littered by the children, or used at all by them during her absence at her daily occupation, in the summer.</s> <s>So she let them use the third room for their employments and their play.</s> <s>Her occupation, every summer's day, was serving out the waters from a mineral spring, a good deal frequented by sick people, three miles from her house, on the way to Gainsborough.</s> <s>She set off, after an early breakfast, in the cool of the morning, and generally arrived at the hill-side where the spring was, and had unlocked her little shed, and taken out her glasses, and rinsed them, before any travellers passed.</s> <s>It was rarely indeed that a sick person had to wait a minute for her appearance.</s> <s>There she sat, in her shed when it rained, and under a tree when it was fine, sewing or knitting very diligently when no customers appeared, and now and then casting a glance over the Levels to the spot where her husband's mill rose in the midst of the green fields, and where she almost fancied sometimes that she could see the children sitting on the mill-steps, or working in the garden.</s> <s>When customers appeared, she was always ready in a moment to serve them; and her smile cheered those who were sick, and pleased those who came merely from curiosity.</s> <s>She slipped the halfpence she received into a pocket beneath her apron; and sometimes the pocket was such a heavy one to carry three miles home, that she just stepped aside to the village shop at Haxey, or into a farm-house where the people would be going to market next day, to get her copper exchanged for silver.</s> <s>Since the times had become so troubled as they were now, however, she had avoided showing her money anywhere on the road.</s> <s>Her husband's advice was that she should give up attending the spring altogether; but she gained so much money by it, and it was so likely that somebody would step into her place there as soon as she gave it up, so that she would not be able to regain her office when quieter times should come, that she entreated him to allow her to go on while she had no fears.</s> <s>She took the heavy gold ear-rings out of her ears, wore a plainer cap, and left her large silver watch at home; so that she looked like a poor woman whom no needy soldier or bold thief would think of robbing.</s> <s>She guessed by the sun what was the right time for locking up her glasses and going home; and she commonly met her husband, coming to fetch her, before she had got half-way.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="settlers.c0.p11"><s>The three children were sure to be perched on the top of the quarry bank, or on the mill-steps, or out on the roof of the house, at the top of the winding staircase.</s> <s>Little George himself, though only two years old, knew the very moment when he should shout and clap his hands, to make his mother wave her handkerchief from the turn of the road.</s> <s>Oliver and Mildred did not exactly feel that the days were too long while their mother was away, for they had plenty to do; but they felt that the best part of the day was the hour between her return and their going to bed: and, unlike people generally, they liked winter better than summer, because at that season their mother never left them, except to go to the shop, or the market at Haxey.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="settlers.c0.p12"><s>Though Oliver was only eleven, and Mildred nine, they were not too young to have a great deal to do.</s> <s>Oliver was really useful as a gardener; and many a good dish of vegetables of his growing came to table in the course of the year.</s> <s>Mildred had to take care of the child almost all day; she often prepared the cabbage, and cut the bacon for Ailwin to broil.</s> <s>She could also do what Ailwin could not,--she could sew a little; and now and then there was an apron or a handkerchief ready to be shown when Mrs Linacre came home in the evening.</s> <s>If she met with any difficulty in her job, the maid could not help her, but her father sometimes could; and it was curious to see Mildred mounting the mill when she was at any loss, and her father wiping the white plaster off his hands, and taking the needle or the scissors in his great fingers, rather than that his little girl should not be able to surprise her mother with a finished piece of work.</s> <s>Then, both Oliver and Mildred had to learn their catechism, to say to Pastor Dendel on Sunday; and always a copy or an exercise on hand, to be ready to show him when he should call; and some book to finish that he had lent them to read, and that others of his flock would be ready for when they had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="settlers.c0.p13"><s>Besides all this, there was an occupation which both boy and girl thought more of than of all others together.</s> <s>Among the loads of gypsum that came to the mill, there were often pieces of the best kind,--lumps of real, fine alabaster.</s> <s>Alabaster is so soft as to be easily worked.</s> <s>Even a finger-nail will make a mark upon it.</s> <s>Everybody knows how beautiful vases and little statues, well wrought in alabaster, look on a mantelpiece, or a drawing-room table.</s> <s>Oliver had seen such in France, where they are very common: and his father had carried one or two ornaments of this kind into Holland, when he had to leave France.</s> <s>It was a great delight for Oliver to find, on settling in Axholme, that he could have as much alabaster as he pleased, if he could only work it.</s> <s>With a little help from Pastor Dendel and his father, he soon learned to do so; and of all his employments, he liked this the best.</s> <s>Pastor Dendel brought him a few bowls and cups of pretty shapes and different sizes, made of common wood by a turner, who was one of his flock; and Oliver first copied these in clay, and then in alabaster.</s> <s>By degrees he learned to vary his patterns, and at last to make his clay models from fancies of his own,--some turning out failures, and others prettier than any of his wooden cups.</s> <s>These last he proceeded to carve out of alabaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="settlers.c0.p14"><s>Mildred could not help watching him while he was about his favourite work, though it was difficult to keep little George from tossing the alabaster about, and stamping on the best pieces, or sucking them.</s> <s>He would sometimes give his sister a few minutes' peace and quiet by rolling the wooden bowls the whole length of the room, and running after them: and there was also an hour, in the middle of the day, when he went to sleep in his large Dutch cradle.</s> <s>At those times Mildred would consult with her brother about his work; or sew or watch him by turns; or read one of the pastor's little books, stopping occasionally to wonder whether Oliver could attend at once to his carving, and to what she was reading.</s> <s>When she saw that he was spoiling any part, or that his hand was shaking, she would ask whether he had not been at work long enough; and then they would run out to the garden or the quarry, or to jump George (if he was awake again) from the second mill-step.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="settlers.c0.p15"><s>One fine month of August, not a breath of wind had been blowing for a week or two, so that the mill-sails had not made a single turn; not a load of gypsum had been brought during the time, and Oliver was quite out of alabaster; though, as it happened, he much wanted a good supply, for a particular reason.</s> <s>Every morning he brought out his tools; and every morning the sky was so clear, the corn-fields so still--the very trees so silent, that he wondered whether there had ever been so calm a month of August before.</s> <s>His father and he employed their time upon the garden, while they had so good an opportunity.</s> <s>Before it was all put in order, and the entire stock of autumn cabbages set, there came a breezy day; and the children were left to finish the cabbage patch by themselves.</s> <s>While they were at work, it made them merry to hear the mill-sails whirring through the air, and to see, at intervals, the trees above the quarry bowing their heads, and the reeds waving in the swamp, and the water of the meadow-ponds dimpling and rippling, as the wind swept over the Levels.</s> <s>Oliver soon heard something that he liked better still--the creak of the truck that brought the gypsum from the quarry, and the crack of the driver's whip.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="settlers.c0.p16"><s>He threw down the dibble with which he was planting out his cabbages-- tripped over the line he had set to direct his drilling, tumbled on his face, scrambled up again, and ran, rubbing the dirt from his knees as he went, to look out some alabaster from the load.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="settlers.c0.p17"><s>Mildred was not long after him, though he called to her that she had better stay and finish the cabbages, and though little George, immediately on feeling himself at liberty, threw himself upon the fresh mould of the cabbage bed, and amused himself with pulling up, and flinging right and left, the plants that had just been set.</s> <s>How could Mildred attend to this, when she was sure she was wanted to turn over the gypsum, and see what she could find?</s> <s>So Master George went on with his pranks, till Ailwin, by accident, saw him from the yard, ran and snatched him up, flung him over her shoulder, and carried him away screaming, till, to pacify him, she set him down among the poultry, which he presently found more amusing than young cabbage plants.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="settlers.c0.p18"><s>"Now we shall have a set of new cups for the spring, presently," said Oliver, as he measured lump after lump with his little foot-rule.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="settlers.c0.p19"><s>"Cups for the waters!" exclaimed his father.</s> <s>"So that is the reason of this prodigious hurry, is it, my boy?</s> <s>You think tin cups not good enough for your mother, or for her customers, or for the waters.</s> <s>Which of them do you think ought to be ashamed of tin cups?"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="settlers.c0.p20"><s>"The water, most of all.</s> <s>Instead of sparkling in a clear bright glass, it looks as nasty as it tastes in a thing that is more brown and rusty every time it is dipped.</s> <s>I will give the folk a pair of cups that shall tempt them to drink--a pair of cups as white as milk."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="settlers.c0.p21"><s>"They will not long remain white: and those who broke the glasses will be the more bent upon spoiling your cups, the more pains you spend upon them."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="settlers.c0.p22"><s>"I hope the Redfurns will not happen to hear of them.</s> <s>We need not blab; and the folk who drink the waters go their way, as soon as they have done."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="settlers.c0.p23"><s>"Whether the Redfurns be here or there, my boy, there is no want of prying eyes to see all that the poor foreigners do.</s> <s>Your mother is watched, it is my belief, every time she dips her cup; and I in the mill, and you in the garden.</s> <s>There is no hope of keeping anything from our enemies."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="settlers.c0.p24"><s>Seeing Oliver look about him uneasily, Mr Linacre reproached himself for having said anything to alarm his timid boy: so he added what he himself always found the most comforting thought, when he felt disturbed at living among unkind neighbours.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="settlers.c0.p25"><s>"Let them watch us, Oliver.</s> <s>We do nothing that we need be ashamed of.</s> <s>The whole world is welcome to know how we live,--all we do, from year's end to year's end."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="settlers.c0.p26"><s>"Yes, if they would let us alone, father.</s> <s>But it is so hard to have our things broken and spoiled!"</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="settlers.c0.p27"><s>"So it is; and to know what ill-natured talk is going on about us.</s> <s>But we must let them take their own way, and bear it as well as we can; for there is no help for it."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="settlers.c0.p28"><s>"I wish I were a justice!" cried Mildred.</s> <s>"How I would punish them, every one!"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="settlers.c0.p29"><s>"Then I wish you were a justice, my dear; for we cannot get anybody punished as it is."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="settlers.c0.p30" type="speech"><s>"Mildred," said Oliver, <qs/>"I wish you would finish the cabbages.</s> <s>You know they must be done; and I am very busy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="settlers.c0.p31"><s>"Oh, Oliver!</s> <s>I am such a little thing to plant a whole cabbage bed.</s> <s>You will be able to come by and by; I want to help you."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="settlers.c0.p32"><s>"You cannot help me, dear: and you know how to do the cabbages as well as anybody.</s> <s>You really cannot help me."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="settlers.c0.p33"><s>"Well, I want to see you then."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="settlers.c0.p34"><s>"There is nothing to see yet.</s> <s>You will have done, if you make haste, before I begin to cut.</s> <s>Do, dear!"</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="settlers.c0.p35"><s>"Well, I will," replied Mildred, cheerfully.</s> <s>Her father caught her up, and gave her one good jump down the whole flight of steps, then bidding her work away before the plants were all withered and dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="settlers.c0.p36"><s>She did work away, till she was so hot and tired that she had to stop and rest.</s> <s>There were still two rows to plant; and she thought she should never get through them,--or at any rate, not before Oliver had proceeded a great way with his carving.</s> <s>She was going to cry; but she remembered how that would vex Oliver: so she restrained herself, and ran to ask Ailwin whether she could come and help.</s> <s>Ailwin always did what everybody asked her; so she gave over sorting feathers, and left them all about, while she went down the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="settlers.c0.p37"><s>Mildred knew she must take little George away, or he would be making confusion among the feathers that had been sorted.</s> <s>She invited him to go with her, and peep over the hedge at the geese in the marsh; and the little fellow took her fore-finger, and trotted away with his sister to the hedge.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="settlers.c0.p38"><s>There were plenty of water-fowl in the marsh; and there was something else which Mildred did not seem to like.</s> <s>While George was quack-quacking, and making himself as like a little goose as he could, Mildred softly called to Ailwin, and beckoned her to the hedge.</s> <s>Ailwin came, swinging the great spade in her right hand, as easily as Mildred could flourish George's whip.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="settlers.c0.p39"><s>"Look,--look there!--under that bank, by the dyke!" said Mildred, as softly as if she had been afraid of being heard at a yard's distance.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="settlers.c0.p40"><s>"Eh!</s> <s>Look--if it be not the gipsies!" cried Ailwin, almost as loud as if she had been talking across the marsh.</s> <s>"Eh dear!</s> <s>We have got the gipsies upon us now; and what will become of my poultry?</s> <s>Yon is a gipsy tent, sure; and we must tell the master and mistress, and keep an eye on the poultry.</s> <s>Sure, yon is a gipsy tent."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="settlers.c0.p41"><s>Little George, thinking that everybody was very much frightened, began to roar; and that made Ailwin talk louder still, to comfort him; so that nothing that Mildred said was heard.</s> <s>At last, she pulled Ailwin's apron, so that the tall woman stooped down, to ask what she wanted.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="settlers.c0.p42"><s>"I do not think it is the gipsies," said she.</s> <s>"I am afraid it is worse than that.</s> <s>I am afraid it is the Redfurns.</s> <s>This is just the way they settle themselves--in just that sort of tent--when they come to fowl, all autumn."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="settlers.c0.p43" type="speech"><s>"If I catch that Roger," said Ailwin, <qs/>"I'll--."<qe/></s> <s>And she clenched her hand, as if she meant to do terrible things, if she caught Roger.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="settlers.c0.p44"><s>"I will go and call father, shall I?" said Mildred, her teeth chattering, as she stood in the hot sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="settlers.c0.p45"><s>She was turning to go up the garden, when a laugh from George made her look back again.</s> <s>She saw a head covered with an otter-skin cap,--the face looking very cross and threatening, peeping over the hedge,--which was so high above the marsh, that the person must have climbed the bank on purpose to look into the garden.</s> <s>There was no mistaking the face.</s> <s>It was certainly Roger Redfurn--the plague of the settlers, who, with his uncle, Stephen Redfurn, was always doing all the mischief he could to everybody who had, as he said, trespassed on the marshes.</s> <s>Nobody liked to see the Redfurns sitting down in the neighbourhood; and still less, skulking about the premises.</s> <s>Mildred flew towards the mill; while Ailwin, who never stopped to consider what was wise, and might not, perhaps, have hit upon wisdom if she had, took up a stone, and told Roger he had better be gone, for that he had no friends here.</s> <s>Roger seemed to have just come from some orchard; for he pulled a hard apple out of his pocket, aimed it at Ailwin's head, and struck her such a blow on the nose as made her eyes water.</s> <s>While she was wiping her eyes with her apron, and trying to see again, Roger coaxed the child to bring him his apple again, and disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="settlers.c0.p46"><s>When Mildred reached the mill, she found Pastor Dendel there, talking with her father about sending some manure to his land.</s> <s>The pastor was so busy, that he only gave her a nod; and she had therefore time to recover herself, instead of frightening everybody with her looks and her news at once.</s> <s>Oliver could not stay in the house while the pastor was at the mill: so he stood behind him, chipping away at the rough part of his work.</s> <s>Mildred whispered to him that the Redfurns were close at hand.</s> <s>She saw Oliver turn very red, though he told her not to be frightened.</s> <s>Perhaps the pastor perceived this too, when he turned round, for he said--</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="settlers.c0.p47"><s>"What is the matter, children?</s> <s>Mildred, what have you been doing, that you are so out of breath?</s> <s>Have you been running all the way from Lincoln spire?"</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="settlers.c0.p48"><s>"No, sir; not running--but--"</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="settlers.c0.p49"><s>"The Redfurns are come, sir," cried Oliver.</s> <s>"Father, the Redfurns are come."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="settlers.c0.p50"><s>"Roger has been peeping over the hedge into the garden," cried Mildred, sinking into tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="settlers.c0.p51"><s>The miller looked grave, and said here was an end of all peace, for some time to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="settlers.c0.p52" type="speech"><s>"Are you all at the mercy of a boy like Roger Redfurn," asked the pastor, <qs/>"so that you look as if a plague had come with this fresh breeze?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="settlers.c0.p53"><s>"And his uncle, sir."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="settlers.c0.p54"><s>"And his aunt," added Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="settlers.c0.p55"><s>"You know what Stephen Redfurn is, sir," observed Mr Linacre.</s> <s>"Roger beats even him for mischief.</s> <s>And we are at their mercy, sir.</s> <s>There is not a magistrate, as you know, that will hear a complaint from one of us against the country-people.</s> <s>We get nothing but trouble, and expense, and ridicule, by making complaints.</s> <s>We know this beforehand; for the triumph is always on the other side."</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="settlers.c0.p56"><s>"It is hard," said the pastor:</s> <s>"but still,--here is only a man, a woman, and a boy.</s> <s>Cannot you defend yourselves against them?"</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="settlers.c0.p57"><s>"No, sir; because they are not an honourable enemy," replied Mr Linacre.</s> <s>"If Stephen would fight it out with me on even ground, we would see who would beat: and I dare say my boy there, though none of the roughest, would stand up against Roger.</s> <s>But such fair trials do not suit them, sir.</s> <s>People who creep through drains, to do us mischief, and hide in the reeds when we are up and awake, and come in among us only when we are asleep, are a foe that may easily ruin any honest man, who cannot get protection from the law.</s> <s>They houghed my cow, two years ago, sir."</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="settlers.c0.p58"><s>"And they mixed all mother's feathers, for the whole year," exclaimed Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="settlers.c0.p59" type="speech"><s>"And they blinded my dog,<qs/>" cried Oliver;--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>put out its eyes."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="settlers.c0.p60"><s>"Oh!</s> <s>What will they do next?" said Mildred, looking up through her tears at the pastor.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="settlers.c0.p61"><s>"Worse things than even these have been done to some of the people in my village," replied the pastor:</s> <s>"and they have been borne, Mildred, without tears."</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="settlers.c0.p62"><s>Mildred made haste to wipe her eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="settlers.c0.p63"><s>"And what do you think, my dears, of the life our Protestant brethren are leading now, in some parts of the world?"</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="settlers.c0.p83" type="speech"><s>"They have been sound asleep, however," observed Oliver to his sister; <qs/>"and it is still so early, that I do not believe they have been abroad about mischief in the night.</s> <s>They would not have been awake yet if they had."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="settlers.c0.p85"><s>"Yes; that is Nan Redfurn,--Stephen's wife.</s> <s>That is their great net that she has over her arm.</s> <s>They are going to draw the oval pond, I think.</s> <s>We can watch their sport nicely here.</s> <s>They cannot see an inch of us."</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="settlers.c0.p88"><s>"Will they come this way when they have done drawing the pond?" asked Mildred, in some fear, as she saw them moving about.</s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="settlers.c0.p90"><s>Oliver was right.</s> <s>All the three repaired to the shallow water, and stood among the reeds, so as to be half hidden.</s> <s>The children could see, however, that when little George came down the garden, shouting to them to come to breakfast, the strangers took heed to the child.</s> <s>They turned their heads for a moment towards the garden, and then spoke together and laughed.</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="settlers.c0.p91"><s>"There, now!" cried Oliver, vexed:</s> <s>"that is all because we forgot to go to breakfast.</s> <s>So much for my not having a watch!</s> <s>Mother need not have sent George to make such a noise; but, if I had had a watch, he would not have come at all; and these people would not have been put in mind of us."</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="settlers.c0.p92"><s>"You will soon be able to have a watch now, like the boys in Holland," said Mildred.</s> <s>"Your alabaster things will change away for a watch; will not they?</s> <s>But we might not have remembered breakfast, if you had had a watch."</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="settlers.c0.p93"><s>"We are forgetting it now," said Oliver, catching up George and running to the house, followed by Mildred, who could not help feeling as if Roger was at her heels.</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="settlers.c0.p94"><s>They were surprised to find how late it was.</s> <s>Their father was already gone with Pastor Dendel's load of manure.</s> <s>Their mother only waited to kiss them before she went, and to tell them the their father meant to be back as soon as he could; and that meantime, neighbour Gool had promised to keep an eye on the mill.</s> <s>If anything happened to frighten them, Oliver or Ailwin had only to set the mill-sails agoing, and neighbour Gool and his men would be with them presently.</s> <s>She did not think, however, that anything would happen in the little time that their father would be away.</s> </p>

<p pid="95" id="settlers.c0.p95"><s>"I will tell you what we will do!" cried Oliver, starting from his chair, after he had been eating his bread and milk, in silence, for some time after his mother's departure.</s> <s>"Let us dress up a figure to look like father, and set him at the mill-window; so that those Redfurns shall not find out that he is away.</s> <s>Won't that be good?"</s> </p>

<p pid="96" id="settlers.c0.p96"><s>"Put him on the mill-steps.</s> <s>They may not look up at the window."</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="settlers.c0.p97"><s>"The mill-steps, then.</s> <s>Where is father's old hat?</s> <s>Put it on the broom there, and see how it looks.</s> <s>Run up to the mill, dear, and bring his jacket--and his apron," he shouted as his sister ran.</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="settlers.c0.p98"><s>Mildred brought both, and they dressed up the broom.</s> </p>

<p pid="99" id="settlers.c0.p99"><s>"That will never do," said Mildred.</s> <s>"Look how the sleeves hang; and how he holds his head!</s> <s>It is not a bit like a man."</s> </p>

<p pid="100" id="settlers.c0.p100"><s>"'Tis a good scarecrow," declared Ailwin.</s> <s>"I have seen many a worse scarecrow than that."</s> </p>

<p pid="101" id="settlers.c0.p101"><s>"But this is to scare the Redfurns, and they are far wiser than crows," said Mildred.</s> <s>"Look how George pulls at the apron, and tugs at the broomstick behind!</s> <s>It does not scare even him."</s> </p>

<p pid="102" id="settlers.c0.p102"><s>"It will look very different on the steps--in the open air," Oliver declared.</s> <s>"A bunch or two of straw in the sleeves, and under the jacket, will make it seem all alive."</s> </p>

<p pid="103" id="settlers.c0.p103"><s>And he carried it out, and tied it upon the mill-steps.</s> <s>It was no easy matter to fasten it so as to make it look at all like a man naturally mounting stairs.</s> <s>The more difficult it was, however, the more they all became interested in the business.</s> <s>Mildred brought straw, and Ailwin tied a knot here, and another knot there, while Oliver cocked the hat in various directions upon the head, till they all forgot what they were dressing up the figure for.</s> <s>The reason popped into Ailwin's head again, when she had succeeded in raising the right arm to the rail, in a very life-like manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="settlers.c0.p104" type="speech"><s>"There!" said she, stepping backwards to view her work, <qs/>"that makes a very good master for me.</s> <s>I will obey him in everything he bids me till master comes home."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="settlers.c0.p105"><s>At the same moment, she walked backwards against something, and little George clung screaming to Mildred's knees.</s> <s>Roger had spread his arms for Ailwin to walk back into; and Stephen was behind, leaning against the cow-shed.</s> <s>They had been watching all that the party had been doing, and, having overheard every word, had found out the reason.</s> </p>

<p pid="106" id="settlers.c0.p106"><s>The children saw at once how very foolish they had been; and the thought confused them so much, that they did not know what to do next.</s> <s>Poor Ailwin, who could never learn wisdom, more or less, now made matters worse by all she said and did.</s> <s>Stout and strong as she was, she could do nothing, for Roger had taken the hint she had given by walking backwards, with her arms crossed behind her: he had pinioned her.</s> <s>She cried out to Oliver to run up, and set the mill-sails agoing, to bring neighbour Gool.</s> <s>Stephen took this second hint.</s> <s>He quietly swung Oliver off the steps, sent down his scarecrow after him, and himself took his seat on the threshold of the mill.</s> <s>There he sat, laughing to see how Ailwin wearied herself with struggles, while Roger, by merely hanging on her arms, prevented her getting free.</s> <s>When, however, Oliver flew at the boy, and struck him some fierce blows, Stephen came down, drove the little girl and the baby into the house, and locked them in, and then went to help Roger with his strong arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="settlers.c0.p107"><s>It was clear to Mildred what she ought to do.</s> <s>Crying as she was, she put George in a corner, with some playthings, to keep him from the fire till she came to him again, and then mounted the stairs, as quickly as her trembling limbs would let her,--first to her mother's room, and then out upon the roof.</s> <s>She tied a large red handkerchief of her mother's upon her father's Sunday walking-stick, and then waved it, as high as she could hold it, above her head, while she considered how she could fasten it; for it would never do to leave George alone below for many minutes.</s> <s>Perhaps neighbour Gool had seen it already, and would soon be here with his men.</s> <s>But, lest he should not, she must fix her flag, and trust to Stephen and Roger not thinking of looking up to the roof from the yard below.</s> <s>At last, after many attempts, she thrust the stick into a crevice of the roof, and fixed it with heavy things round it,--having run down three or four times, to see that George was safe.</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="settlers.c0.p108"><s>There was, indeed, no time to be lost, for the intruders below were doing all the mischief they could think of, short of robbing and burning the premises.</s> <s>The great tall man, Stephen, strolling about the lower rooms, found Mrs Linacre's knitting, and pulled out the needles, and unravelled the work.</s> <s>Roger spied a heap of bulbs on the corner of a high shelf.</s> <s>They were Mr Linacre's rare and valuable tulip-roots, brought from Holland.</s> <s>Roger cut one of them open, to see what it looked like, and then threw the whole lot into the boiler, now steaming over the fire, saying the family should have a dish the more at dinner to-day.</s> <s>They got hold of Oliver's tools, and the cup he was at work upon.</s> <s>Stephen raised his arm, about to dash the cup to the ground, when Oliver sprang forward, and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="settlers.c0.p109"><s>"You shall have it,--you shall have my cup;--you don't know what a beauty it will be, when it is done.</s> <s>Only let me finish it, and you shall have it in exchange for the stickleback you caught this morning.</s> <s>The stickleback will do to manure our garden; and I am sure you will like the cup, if you will only let me finish it."</s> </p>

<p pid="110" id="settlers.c0.p110"><s>"Manure your garden, indeed!" cried Stephen, gruffly.</s> <s>"I'll cut up your garden to shreds first.</s> <s>What business has your garden in our carr?</s> <s>You and your great landlord will find what it is to set your outlandish plants growing where our geese ought to be grazing.</s> <s>We'll show you that we don't want any foreigners here; and if you don't like our usage, you may go home again; and nobody will cry for you back."</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="settlers.c0.p111"><s>"We pay for our garden and our mill," said Oliver.</s> <s>"We wrong nobody, and we work for our living, and you are a very cruel man."</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="settlers.c0.p112"><s>"You pay the king: and the parliament does not choose that the king should have any more money to spend against them.</s> <s>Mind you that, boy!</s> <s>And--"</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="settlers.c0.p113"><s>"I am sure I don't know anything about the king and the parliament, or any such quarrels," said Oliver.</s> <s>"It is very hard to punish us for them, it is very cruel."</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="settlers.c0.p114"><s>"You shall have reason to call me cruel twenty times over, if you don't get away out of our carr," said Stephen.</s> <s>"Manure your garden, indeed!</s> <s>Not I!</s> <s>And you shall not manure another yard in these Levels.</s> <s>Come here, Roger."</s> </p>

<p pid="115" id="settlers.c0.p115"><s>They went out again into the yard, and Oliver, now quite overcome, laid down his head on his arms, and cried bitterly.</s> </p>

<p pid="116" id="settlers.c0.p116"><s>"Here's your cup, however," said Ailwin, now released by Roger's being employed elsewhere.</s> <s>"This bit of plaster is the only thing they have laid hands on that they have not ruined."</s> <s>Oliver started up, and hid his work and tools in a bundle of straw, in the corner of the kitchen.</s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="settlers.c0.p117"><s>"What Mildred will say, I don't know," said Ailwin.</s> <s>"That boy has wrung the neck of her white hen."</s> </p>

<p pid="118" id="settlers.c0.p118"><s>Oliver was desperate on hearing this.</s> <s>He ran out to see whether he could not, by any means, get into the mill, to set the sails agoing: but there were Stephen and Roger, carrying water, which they threw over all the gypsum that was ground,--floating away as much as they could of it, and utterly spoiling the rest, by turning it into a plaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="119" id="settlers.c0.p119"><s>"Did you ever see the like?" cried Ailwin.</s> <s>"And there is nothing master is so particular about as keeping that stuff dry.</s> <s>See the woman, too!</s> <s>How I'd like to tug the hair off her head!</s> <s>She looks badly, poor creature, too."</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="settlers.c0.p120"><s>Stephen's wife had, indeed, come up to enjoy the sport, when she found that no man was on the premises, and that there was no danger.</s> <s>There she stood, leaning against a post of the mill, her black, untidy hair hanging about her pale, hollow cheeks, and her lean arms crossed upon her bosom.</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="settlers.c0.p121" type="speech"><s>"There were such ague-struck folk to be seen at every turn," said Ailwin, <qs/>"before the foreigners came to live in the carr.</s> <s>I suppose they brought some healing with them; for one does not often see now such a poor creature as that.</s> <s>She might be ashamed of herself,--that woman; she laughs all her poor sides can, at every pailful Roger pours out.-- Eh!</s> <s>But she's not laughing now!</s> <s>Eh!</s> <s>What's the matter now?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="122" id="settlers.c0.p122"><s>The matter was that neighbour Gool was in sight, with three or four men.</s> <s>A cheer was heard from them while they were still some way off.</s> <s>Oliver ran out and cheered, waving his hat over his head.</s> <s>Ailwin cheered, waving a towel out of the window.</s> <s>Mildred cheered from the roof, waving her red flag; and George stood in the doorway, shouting and clapping his little hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="123" id="settlers.c0.p123"><s>If the object was to catch the trespassers, all this cheering took place a little too soon.</s> <s>Stephen and Roger were off, like their own wild-ducks,--over the garden hedge, and out of sight.</s> <s>Neighbour Gool declared that if they were once fairly among the reeds in the marsh, it would be sheer waste of time to search for them; for they could dodge and live in the water, in a way that honest people that lived on proper hard ground could not follow.</s> <s>Here was the woman; and yonder was the tent.</s> <s>Revenge might be taken that way, better than by ducking in the ponds after the man and boy.</s> <s>Suppose they took the woman to prison, and made a great fire in the carr, of the tent and everything in it!</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="settlers.c0.p124"><s>Oliver did not see that it could make up to them for what they had lost, to burn the tent; and he was pretty sure his father would not wish such a thing to be done.</s> <s>His father would soon be home.</s> <s>As for the woman, he thought she ought to go to prison, if Mr Gool would take her there.</s> </p>

<p pid="131" id="settlers.c0.p131"><s>Neighbour Gool put on an air of being rather offended that nothing great was to be done, after his trouble in coming to help.</s> <s>In his heart, however, he was perhaps not very sorry; for he knew that the magistrates were not willing to countenance the king's settlers in the Levels, while the Parliament Committee was sitting at Lincoln.</s> <s>Gool patted Oliver's head when the boy thanked him for coming; and he joked Mildred about her flag: so he could not be very cross.</s> <s>He left two men to guard the prisoner and the premises, till Mr Linacre should return.</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="settlers.c0.p132"><s>These two men soon left off marching about the garden and yard, and sat down on the mill-steps; for the day grew very hot.</s> <s>There they sat talking in the shade, till their dinners should be ready.</s> <s>Nan Redfurn was so far from feeling the day to be hot, that when her cold ague-fit came on, she begged to be allowed to go down to the kitchen fire.</s> <s>Little George stood staring at her for some time, and then ran away; and Mildred, not liking to be in the same room with a woman who looked as she did, and who was a prisoner, stole out too, though she had been desired to watch the woman till dinner should be ready.</s> <s>Ailwin was so struck with compassion, that she fetched her warmest woollen stockings and her winter cloak of linsey-woolsey,--it was such a piteous thing to hear a woman's teeth chattering in her head, in that way, at noon in the middle of August.</s> <s>Having wrapped her up, she put her on a stool, close to the great kitchen fire; and drew out the screen that was used only in winter, to keep off the draughts from the door.</s> <s>If the poor soul was not warm in that corner, nothing could make her so.</s> <s>Then Ailwin began to sing to cheer her heart, and to be amazingly busy in cooking dinner for three additional persons.</s> <s>She never left off her singing but when she out went for the vegetables, and other things she wanted for her cooking; and when she came in again she resumed her song,--still for the sake of the poor creature behind the screen.</s> </p>

<p pid="163" id="settlers.c0.p163"><s>When she looked round, she saw a rushing, roaring river where the garden had been, just before.</s> <s>Rough waters were dashing up against the hill on which she stood,--against the house,--and against the mill.</s> <s>She saw the flood spreading, as rapidly as the light at sunrise, over the whole expanse of the Levels.</s> <s>She saw another flood bursting in from the Humber, on the north-east, and meeting that which had just swept by;-- she saw the two floods swallowing up field after field, meadow after meadow, splashing up against every house, and surrounding all, so that the roofs, and the stacks beside them, looked like so many little islands.</s> <s>She saw these things in a moment, but did not heed them till afterwards,--for, where was Oliver?</s> </p>

<p pid="254" id="settlers.c0.p254"><s>Some of the sufferers knew how their misfortune happened.</s> <s>Others might be thankful that they did not; for the thought of the malice of their enemies must have been more bitter than the fear of ruin and death.</s> </p>

<p pid="256" id="settlers.c0.p256"><s>"We shall see what father does," was still the consolation with which Oliver kept down his sister's fears.</s> <s>He had such confidence in his father's knowing what was best to be done on all occasions, that he felt they had only to watch him, and imitate whatever he might attempt.</s> <s>They remained quiet on the island now, hungry and tired as they were, because he remained in the mill, and seemed to expect the water to subside.</s> <s>The most fearful thought was what they were to do after dark, if they should not get home before that.</s> <s>They supposed, at last, that their father was thinking of this too; for he began to move about, when the sun was near setting, more than he had done all the afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="257" id="settlers.c0.p257"><s>They saw him go carefully down into the stream, and proceed cautiously for some way--till the water was up to his chin.</s> <s>Then he was buffeted about so terribly that Mildred could not bear to look.</s> <s>Both Oliver and Roger were sure, by what he ventured, and by the way he pulled himself back at last to the steps, that he had tied himself by the rope they had seen him measure.</s> <s>It was certainly too short for any good purpose; for he had to go back, having only wetted himself to the skin.</s> <s>They saw this by the yellow light from the west which shone upon the water.</s> <s>In a few minutes they could distinguish him no longer, though the mill stood up black against the sky, and in the midst of the gleaming flood.</s> </p>

<p pid="258" id="settlers.c0.p258"><s>"Father will be wet, and so cold all night!" said Mildred, crying.</s> </p>

<p pid="259" id="settlers.c0.p259" type="speech"><s>"If I could only swim," exclaimed Oliver, <qs/>"I would get over to him somehow, and carry a rope from the house.</s> <s>I am sure there must be a rope long enough somewhere about the yard.</s> <s>If I could only swim, I would get to him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="260" id="settlers.c0.p260"><s>"That you wouldn't," said Roger.</s> <s>"Your father can swim; and why does not he?</s> <s>Because nobody could swim across that stream.</s> <s>It is a torrent.</s> <s>It would carry any stout man out over the carr; and you would be no better than a twig in the middle of it."</s> </p>

<p pid="261" id="settlers.c0.p261"><s>"I am afraid now this torrent will not slacken," said Oliver, thoughtfully.</s> <s>"I am afraid there is some hollow near which will keep up the current."</s> </p>

<p pid="262" id="settlers.c0.p262"><s>"What do you mean by that?"</s> </p>

<p pid="263" id="settlers.c0.p263"><s>"They say in Holland, where they have floods sometimes, that when water flows into a hollow, it gets out in a current, and keeps it up for some way.</s> <s>Oh!</s> <s>The quarry!" he cried, with sudden recollection.</s> <s>"Mildred, let us go, and look what is doing on that side before it is dark."</s> </p>

<p pid="264" id="settlers.c0.p264"><s>They ran round the hill; and there they saw indeed that the flood was tumbling in the quarry, like water boiling in a pot.</s> <s>When it rushed out, it carried white earth with it, which made a long streak in the flood, and explained how it was that the stream between the house and the mill was whiter and more muddy than that between their hill and the house.</s> <s>At once it occurred to Roger that the stream between the hill and the house was probably less rapid than the other; and he said so.</s> <s>Oliver ran back; and so did Mildred, pleased at the bare idea of getting to the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="265" id="settlers.c0.p265"><s>Once more arrived opposite the house, they saw a strange sight.</s> <s>The mill no longer stood in its right place.</s> <s>It had moved a good way down towards the carr.</s> <s>Not only that, but it was still moving.</s> <s>It was sailing away like a ship.</s> <s>After the first exclamation, even Roger stood as still as death to watch it.</s> <s>He neither moved nor spoke till the mill was out of sight in the dusk.</s> <s>When Mildred burst into a loud cry, and Oliver threw himself down, hiding his face on the ground, Roger spoke again.</s> </p>

<p pid="266" id="settlers.c0.p266"><s>"Be quiet--you must," he said, decidedly, to the little girl.</s> <s>"We must bestir ourselves now, instead of stopping to see what other folks will do."</s> </p>

<p pid="268" id="settlers.c0.p268"><s>"You don't know that.</s> <s>If he drifts out to the Humber, which is likely, by the way he is going, some ship may pick him up--or he may light upon some high ground.</s> <s>We can't settle that now, however; and the clear thing is that he wouldn't wish us to starve, whether he drowns or not.</s> <s>Come, get up, lad!" said he, stirring Oliver with his foot.</s> </p>

<p pid="270" id="settlers.c0.p270"><s>Oliver rose, and did all that Roger bade him.</s> </p>

<p pid="274" id="settlers.c0.p274"><s>"In the lumber-room," said Mildred.</s> <s>"The spare bed is tied round and round with a long rope--I don't know how long."</s> </p>

<p pid="278" id="settlers.c0.p278"><s>Oliver had a steel knife; but it was too dark to look for a flint, if any other plan than a fire would do.</s> </p>

<p pid="279" id="settlers.c0.p279" type="speech"><s>"Well, don't plague any more about a fire," said Roger, <qs/>"but listen to me.</s> <s>Can you climb a tree?</s> <s>I'll be bound you can't: and now you'll die if you can't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="280" id="settlers.c0.p280" type="speech"><s>"I can," said Oliver; <qs/>"but what is Mildred to do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="281" id="settlers.c0.p281"><s>"We'll see that afterwards.</s> <s>Which of these trees stands nearest to the nearest of yon upper windows?"</s> </p>

<p pid="282" id="settlers.c0.p282"><s>Oliver and Mildred pointed out a young ash, which now quite bent over the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="283" id="settlers.c0.p283"><s>"That is not strong enough," said Roger, shaking the tree, and finding it loosened at the roots.</s> <s>"Show me a stouter one."</s> </p>

<p pid="284" id="settlers.c0.p284"><s>A well-grown beech was the next nearest.</s> <s>Roger pulled Oliver by the arm, and made him stand directly under the tree, with his sister beside him.</s> <s>He desired them not to move from where they were, and to give a loud halloo together, or a shriek (or anything that might be heard furthest)--about once in a minute for an hour to come, unless they should hear a rope fall into the tree, or anywhere near them.</s> <s>They were to watch for this rope, and use all their endeavours to catch it.</s> <s>There would be a weight at the end, which would make it easier to catch.</s> <s>Oliver must tie this rope to the trunk of the tree, stretching it tight, with all his strength, and then tying it so securely that no weight would unfasten it.</s> </p>

<p pid="285" id="settlers.c0.p285"><s>"Mind you that," said Roger.</s> <s>"If you don't, you will be drowned, that's all.</s> <s>Do as I tell you, and you'll see what you will see."</s> </p>

<p pid="295" id="settlers.c0.p295"><s>They kneeled down, and Oliver said aloud to God what was in his heart.</s> <s>It was a great comfort to them both; for they knew that while no human eye saw them in the starlight, under the tree, God heard their words, and understood their hearts.</s> </p>

<p pid="297" id="settlers.c0.p297"><s>They raised a cry about once a minute, as nearly as they could guess: and they had given as many as thirty shouts, and began to find it very hard work, before anything happened to show them that it was of any use.</s> <s>Then something struck the tree over their heads, and pattered down among the leaves, touching Oliver's head at last.</s> <s>He felt about, and caught the end of a rope, without having to climb the tree, to search for it.</s> <s>They set up a shout of a different kind now; for they really were very glad.</s> <s>This shout was answered by a gentle tug at the rope: but Oliver held fast, determined not to let anything pull the precious line out of his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="298" id="settlers.c0.p298"><s>"What have we here?" said he, as he felt a parcel tied to the rope, a little way from the end.</s> <s>He gave it to Mildred to untie and open; which she did with some trouble, wishing the evening was not so dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="303" id="settlers.c0.p303"><s>In a few minutes, there was a fire blazing near the tree.</s> <s>The rope must have come straight over from the house, without dipping once into the water; for not only were the flint and steel safe, but the tinder within, and the cloth that the box was done up in, were quite dry.</s> </p>

<p pid="304" id="settlers.c0.p304"><s>"Roger is a clever fellow,--that is certain," said Oliver.</s> <s>"Now for fastening the rope.</s> <s>Do you take care that the fire keeps up.</s> <s>Don't spare for chips.</s> <s>Keep a good fire till I have done."</s> </p>

<p pid="305" id="settlers.c0.p305"><s>Oliver gave all his strength to pulling the rope tight, and winding it round the trunk of the beech, just above a large knob in the stem.</s> <s>It seemed to him that the rope stretched pretty evenly, as far as he could see,--not slanting either up or down; so that the sill of the upper window must be about upon a level with the great knob in the beech-trunk.</s> <s>Oliver tied knot upon knot, till no more rope was left to knot.</s> <s>It still hung too slack, if it was meant for a bridge.</s> <s>He did not think he could ever cross the water on a rope that would keep him dangling at every move: but he had pulled it tight with all his force, and he could do no more.</s> <s>When he had tied the last knot, he and Mildred stood in front of the fire, and raised one more great shout, waving their arms--sure now of being seen as well as heard.</s> </p>

<p pid="306" id="settlers.c0.p306" type="speech"><s>"Look!</s> <s>Look!" cried Oliver, <qs/>"it is moving;--the rope is not so slack!</s> <s>They are tightening it.</s> <s>How much tighter it is than I could pull it!</s> <s>That must be Ailwin's strong arm,--together with Roger's."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="321" id="settlers.c0.p321"><s>As he spoke, he opened the door to admit the dog, which Ailwin had put out upon the stairs, for the sake of her pet hen and chicks which were all in the room.</s> <s>The hen fluttered up to a beam below the ceiling, on the appearance of the dog, and the chicks cluttered about, till Ailwin and Mildred caught them, and kept them in their laps.</s> <s>They glanced timidly at Roger, remembering the fate of the white hen, the day before.</s> <s>Roger did not heed them.</s> <s>He had taken out his knife, forked up the mutton out of the kettle, and cut off the best half for himself and his dog.</s> </p>

<p pid="335" id="settlers.c0.p335"><s>Oliver chose to examine first how high the water stood in the lower rooms.</s> <s>He lighted a piece of wood, and found that only two steps of the lower flight of stairs remained dry.</s> <s>Ailwin protested so earnestly that the waters had not risen for two or three hours, that he thought they might all lie down to sleep.</s> <s>Ailwin and he were the only ones who could keep watch.</s> <s>He did not think Ailwin's watching would be worth much; he was so tired that he did not think he could keep awake; and he felt that he should be much more fit for all the business that lay before him for the next day, if he could get a good rest now.</s> <s>So he kissed little George, as he lay down beside him, and was soon as sound asleep as all his companions.</s> </p>

<p pid="336" id="settlers.c0.p336"><s>CHAPTER FIVE.</s> <s>SUNRISE OVER THE LEVELS.</s> </p>

<p pid="337" id="settlers.c0.p337"><s>All the party slept for some hours, as quietly and unconsciously as little George himself.</s> <s>If the children were so weary that the dreadful uncertainty about their father's fate could not keep them awake, it is probable that a knowledge of their own danger might have failed to disturb them.</s> <s>But they had little more idea than George himself of the extent of the peril they were in.</s> <s>They did not know that the Levels were surrounded by hills on every side but towards the sea; or, if they knew, they did not consider this, because the hills were a great way off.</s> <s>But, whether they were far or near, this circle of hills was the cause of the waters rising to a great height in the Levels, when once the defences that had kept out the sea and the rivers were broken down.</s> <s>As the hills prevented the overflowing waters from running off on three sides, it was clear that the waters must rise to the level of the sea and the rivers from which they flowed in.</s> <s>They had not reached this height when the children lay down to rest, though Ailwin was so sure that the worst was over; and the danger increased as they slept; slept too soundly even to dream of accidents.</s> </p>

<p pid="338" id="settlers.c0.p338" type="speech"><s>The first disturbance was from the child.</s> <s>Oliver became aware, through his sleep, that little George was moving about and laughing.</s> <s>Oliver murmured, <qs/>"Be quiet, George.</s> <s>Lie still, dear,"<qe/> and the child was quiet for a minute.</s> <s>Presently, however, he moved again, and something like a dabbling in water was heard, while, at the same moment, Oliver found his feet cold.</s> <s>He roused himself with a start, felt that his bed was wet, and turning out, was up to the ankles in water.</s> <s>By the light of the embers, he saw that the floor was a pond, with some shoes floating on it.</s> <s>His call woke Ailwin and Mildred at once.</s> <s>Roger did not stir, though there was a good deal of bustle and noise.</s> </p>

<p pid="339" id="settlers.c0.p339"><s>Mildred's bed was so high above the floor as to be still quite dry.</s> <s>Oliver told her to stay there till he should settle what was to be done next: and he took up the child to put him with Mildred, asking her to strip off his drenched clothes, and keep him warm.</s> <s>All the apparel that had been taken off was luckily on the top of a chest, far above the water.</s> <s>Oliver handed this to his sister, bidding her dress herself, as well as the child.</s> <s>He then carefully put the fire together, to make as much light as possible, and then told Ailwin that they must bestir themselves, as the fire would presently be drowned out.</s> </p>

<p pid="340" id="settlers.c0.p340"><s>Ailwin was quite ready to bestir herself; but she had no idea beyond mounting on chests, chairs, and drawers; unless, indeed, she thought of the beam which crossed the ceiling, to which she was seen to cast her eyes, as if envying the chicks which hung there, or the hen which still slept, with her head beneath her wing, out of present reach of the flood.</s> </p>

<p pid="341" id="settlers.c0.p341"><s>Oliver disapproved of the plan of mounting on the furniture of the room.</s> <s>It might be all very well, he said, if there were nothing better to be done.</s> <s>But, by the time the water would reach the top of the chests, it would be impossible to get out by the door.</s> <s>He thought it would be wisest to reach the roof of the house while they could, and to carry with them all the comforts they could collect, while they might be removed in a dry condition.</s> <s>Ailwin agreed, and was going to throw open the door, when Oliver stopped her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="342" id="settlers.c0.p342" type="speech"><s>"Why, Oliver," she cried, <qs/>"you won't let one do anything; and you say, all the time, that there is not a minute to be lost."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="343" id="settlers.c0.p343"><s>Oliver showed her that water was streaming in at the sides of the door, a good way higher up than it stood on the floor.</s> <s>He said that the door was a defence at present,--that the water was higher on the stairs than in the room, and that there would be a great rush as soon as the door should be opened.</s> <s>He wished, therefore, that the bedding, and the clothes from the drawers, and all else that they could remove to the top of the house, should be bundled up, and placed on the highest chest of drawers, before the water should be let in.</s> <s>They must borrow the line from the clothes' basket, to tie round George's waist, that they might not lose him in the confusion.</s> <s>One other thing must be done: they must rouse Roger, or he might be drowned.</s> </p>

<p pid="344" id="settlers.c0.p344"><s>Ailwin was anxious that this last piece of duty should be omitted:--not that she exactly wished that Roger should be drowned,--at least, not through her means; but she, ignorant as she was,--had a superstitious feeling that Roger and his family had caused this flood, and that he could save himself well enough, though he appeared to be sunk in a drunken sleep.</s> <s>She indulged Oliver, however, so far as to help him to seize the lad, neck and heels, and lay him, dripping as he was, upon the table.</s> </p>

<p pid="345" id="settlers.c0.p345"><s>Before the bedding and clothes were all tied up, the door of the room shook so as to threaten to burst in, from the latch giving way.</s> <s>It struck everybody that the person who should open it would run the risk of being suffocated, or terribly knocked about; and yet, it was hardly wise to wait for its bursting.</s> <s>Oliver, therefore, tied a string to the knob of the bolt, then slipped the bolt, to keep the door fastened while he lifted and tied up the latch.</s> <s>The door shook more and more; so, having set the window wide open, he made haste to scramble up to where Mildred was, wound the cord which was about George's waist round his own arm, bade Mildred hold the child fast, and gave notice that he was going to open the door.</s> <s>It was a strange party, as the boy could not help noting at the moment,--the maid standing on the bed, hugging the bed-post, and staring with frightened eyes; Roger snoring on the table, just under the sleeping hen on the beam; and the three children perched on the top of a high chest of drawers.</s> <s>George took it all for play,-- the new sash he had on and the bolting the door, and the climbing and scrambling.</s> <s>He laughed and kicked, so that his sister could scarcely hold him.</s> <s>"Now for it!" cried Oliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="346" id="settlers.c0.p346"><s>"Oh, Oliver, stop a minute!" cried Ailwin.</s> <s>"Don't be in such a hurry to drown us all, Oliver.</s> <s>Stop a moment, Oliver."</s> </p>

<p pid="347" id="settlers.c0.p347"><s>Oliver knew, however, that the way to drown them all was to stop.</s> <s>At the first pull the bolt gave way, the door burst open, as if it would break from its hinges, and a great body of water dashed in.</s> <s>The first thing the wave did was to wash Roger off the table; the next, to put out the fire with a fizz,--so that there was no other light but the dawn, now advancing.</s> <s>The waters next dashed up against the wall opposite the door; and then by the rebound, with less force, against the drawers on which the children sat.</s> <s>It then leaped out of the window, leaving a troubled surface at about half the height of the room.</s> <s>Above the noise, Ailwin was heard lamenting, the chicks cluttering, the hen fluttering, and George laughing and clapping his hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="348" id="settlers.c0.p348"><s>"You have George safe?" said Oliver.</s> <s>"Very well!</s> <s>I believe we can all get out.</s> <s>There is Roger's head above water; and I don't think it is more than up to my neck; though everybody laughs at me for being a short boy."</s> </p>

<p pid="349" id="settlers.c0.p349"><s>He stepped down upon a chair, and then cautiously into the water.</s> <s>It was very nearly up to his chin.</s> </p>

<p pid="350" id="settlers.c0.p350"><s>"That will do," said he, cheerfully.</s> <s>"Now, Ailwin, you are the tallest;--please carry George out on the roof of the house, and stay there with him till I come."</s> </p>

<p pid="351" id="settlers.c0.p351"><s>Ailwin made many lamentations at having to step down into the water; but she took good care of the child, carrying him quite high and dry.</s> <s>Oliver followed, to see that he was tied securely to the balustrade on the roof.</s> <s>While he was doing this, Ailwin brought Mildred in the same way.</s> <s>Mildred wanted to be of use below; but her brother told her the best thing she could do was to watch and amuse George, and to stand ready to receive the things saved from the chambers,--she not being tall enough to do any service in four feet of water.</s> </p>

<p pid="352" id="settlers.c0.p352" type="speech"><s>It was a strange forlorn feeling to Mildred,--the being left on the house-top in the cold grey morning, at an hour when she had always hitherto been asleep in bed.</s> <s>The world itself, as she looked round her, seemed unlike the one she had hitherto lived in.</s> <s>The stars were in the sky; but they were dim,--fading before the light of morning.</s> <s>There were no fields, no gardens, no roads to be seen;--only grey water, far away on every side.</s> <s>She could see nothing beyond this grey water, except towards the east, where a line of low hills stood between her and the brightening sky.</s> <s>Poor Mildred felt dizzy, with so much moving water before her eyes, and in her ears the sound of the current below.</s> <s>The house shook and trembled, too, under the force of the flood: so that she was glad to fix her sight on the steady line of the distant hills.</s> <s>She spoke to George occasionally, to keep him quiet; and she was ready to receive every article that was handed up the stairs from below: but, in all the intervals, she fixed her eyes on the distant hills.</s> <s>She thought how easy it would be to reach that ridge, if she were a bird; and how hard it would be to pine away on this house-top, or to sink to death in these waters, for want of the wings which inferior creatures had.</s> <s>Then she thought of superior creatures that had wings too: and she longed to be an angel.</s> <s>She longed to be out of all this trouble and fear; and considered that it would be worth while to be drowned, to be as free as a bird or an angel.</s> <s>She resolved to remember this, and not to be frightened, if the water should rise and rise, till it should sweep her quite away.</s> <s>She thought that this might have befallen her mother yesterday.</s> <s>No boat had been seen on the waters in the direction of Gainsborough; no sign had reached the family that any one was thinking of them at a distance, and trying to save them: and Oliver and Mildred had agreed that it was likely that Mrs Linacre had heard some report of the pulling up of the sluices, and might have been on her way home when the flood overtook and drowned her.</s> <s>If so, she might be now an angel.</s> <s>If an angel, Mildred was sure her first thought would be, as it had ever been, of her home and her children; and the little girl looked up to see whether there was anything like the shadow of wings between her and the dim stars.</s> <s>She saw nothing; but still, in some kind of hope, she softly breathed the words, <qs/>"O, mother!</s> <s>Mother!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="353" id="settlers.c0.p353"><s>"Mother!</s> <s>Mother!" shouted little George, as he overheard her.</s> <s>Oliver leaped up the stairs, and inquired whether there was a boat,--whether mother was coming.</s> </p>

<p pid="354" id="settlers.c0.p354"><s>"No, Oliver, no.</s> <s>I was only thinking about mother; and so, I suppose, was George.</s> <s>I am afraid you are disappointed;--I am sorry."</s> </p>

<p pid="355" id="settlers.c0.p355"><s>Oliver bit his lip to prevent crying, and could not speak directly; but seemed to be gazing carefully all around the waste.</s> </p>

<p pid="356" id="settlers.c0.p356" type="speech"><s>"Unless she should be an angel now,<qs/>" whispered Mildred,--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>unless she died yesterday; and then she might be with us now, at this very moment, though we cannot see her;--might not she?"<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="357" id="settlers.c0.p357"><s>"Yes, I believe so, dear.</s> <s>And, for one thing, I almost wish she may not come in a boat.</s> <s>Who should tell her that father was carried away into all those waters, without having spoken one word to us?"</s> </p>

<p pid="358" id="settlers.c0.p358"><s>"If they are both dead, do you not think they are together now?" asked Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="359" id="settlers.c0.p359"><s>"Certainly.</s> <s>Pastor Dendel says that all who love one another well enough will live together, where they will never die any more."</s> </p>

<p pid="360" id="settlers.c0.p360"><s>"And I am sure they did," said Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="361" id="settlers.c0.p361" type="speech"><s>"If they see us now," said Oliver, <qs/>"it must make a great difference to them whether we are frightened and miserable, or whether we behave as we ought to do.</s> <s>Let us try not to be frightened, for their sakes, dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="362" id="settlers.c0.p362"><s>"And if they are not with us all the while, God is," whispered Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="363" id="settlers.c0.p363"><s>"O, yes; but God knows ...  God will not expect..."</s> </p>

<p pid="364" id="settlers.c0.p364"><s>"Surely He will feel in some way as they do about us," said Mildred, remembering and repeating the verse Pastor Dendel had taught her.</s> <s>"`Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="365" id="settlers.c0.p365"><s>"`For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.'"</s> <s>So Oliver continued the psalm.</s> </p>

<p pid="366" id="settlers.c0.p366"><s>"There comes the sun!" exclaimed Mildred, happy to greet some one familiar object amidst this strange scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="367" id="settlers.c0.p367"><s>The scene hardly appeared the same when the sun, after first peeping above the hills like a golden star, flamed up to its full size, and cast a broad glittering light over the wide waters, and into the very eyes of the children.</s> <s>They felt the warmth too, immediately; and it was very cheering.</s> <s>The eastern hills now almost disappeared in the sun's blaze; and those to the west shone very clearly; and the southern ridge near Gainsborough, looked really but a little way off.</s> <s>The children knew, however, that there were three full miles between them and any land, except their Red-hill, and a few hillocks which peeped above the flood in the Levels: and there was no sign of a boat, far or near.</s> <s>Oliver checked a sigh, when he had convinced himself of this; and began to look what had become of the people they knew in the Levels.</s> </p>

<p pid="368" id="settlers.c0.p368"><s>Neighbour Gool's dwelling stood low; and nothing was now to be seen of it but a dark speck, which might be the top of a chimney.</s> <s>It was possible that the whole family might have escaped; for Gool and his wife were to be at Haxey yesterday; and they might there hear of the mischief intended or done to the sluices, in time to save the rest of the household.</s> <s>Some of the roofs of the hamlet of Sandtoft stood above the waters; and the whole upper part of the chapel used by the foreigners; and many might easily have found a refuge there.</s> <s>Further off, a conspicuous object was the elegant crocketed spire of one of the beautiful Lincolnshire churches, standing high, as if inviting those who were dismayed to come and save themselves in the air from the dangers of the waters.</s> <s>Oliver wondered whether any sufferers were now watching the sunrise from the long ridge of the church-roof, or from the windows of the spire.</s> </p>

<p pid="369" id="settlers.c0.p369"><s>One of the most curious sights was the fleets of haystacks that were sailing along in the courses of the currents.</s> <s>As the smaller stacks were sometimes shot forward rapidly, and whirled round by an eddy, while a large stately stack followed forwards, performing the same turns of the voyage, Mildred compared them to a duck and her ducklings in the pond, and Oliver to a great ship voyaging with a fleet of small craft.</s> <s>They saw sights far more sorrowful than this.</s> <s>They grieved over the fine large trees--some in full leaf--that they saw tumbling about in the torrents which cut through the stiller waters; but it was yet worse to see dead cows, horses, pigs, and sheep carried past--some directly through the garden, or over the spot where the mill had stood.</s> <s>There were also thatched roofs carried away entire; and many a chest, chair, and cow-rack--showing the destruction that had gone on during the night.</s> <s>While the distant scene was all bright and lovely in the sunrise, these nearer objects, thickly strewn in the muddy waters, were ugly and dismal; and Oliver saw that it did him and his sister no good to watch them.</s> <s>He started, and said they must not be idle any longer.</s> </p>

<p pid="370" id="settlers.c0.p370"><s>Just then Ailwin called from the stairs,--</s> </p>

<p pid="371" id="settlers.c0.p371"><s>"I say, Oliver, the cow is alive.</s> <s>I heard her low, I'm certain."</s> </p>

<p pid="372" id="settlers.c0.p372"><s>"I am afraid it was only George," said Mildred.</s> <s>"He was lowing like the cow, a minute ago."</s> </p>

<p pid="373" id="settlers.c0.p373"><s>"That might be because he heard the real cow," cried Oliver, with new hope.</s> <s>"I had rather save the cow than anything.</s> <s>I will see if I cannot get into one of the upper rooms that looks towards the yard.</s> <s>We might have a bridge-rope from more windows than one.</s> <s>Where is Roger?</s> <s>What is he fit for?</s> <s>Is he awake?"</s> </p>

<p pid="374" id="settlers.c0.p374"><s>"Awake!</s> <s>Yes, indeed," whispered Ailwin, coming close up to the children.</s> <s>"There is more mischief about that boy than you think for.</s> <s>He is now on the stairs, with more mice, and rats, and spiders, and creeping things about him than I ever saw before in all my days.</s> <s>We are like to be devoured as we stand on our feet; to say nothing of what is to become of us if we lie down."</s> </p>

<p pid="375" id="settlers.c0.p375"><s>Mildred looked at her brother in great terror.</s> </p>

<p pid="376" id="settlers.c0.p376"><s>"We must get rid of them, if they really do us hurt," said Oliver, decidedly, though with an anxious look.</s> <s>"We must drown them, if they are mischievous.</s> <s>We can do that, you know--at least with the larger things.</s> <s>They cannot get away from us."</s> </p>

<p pid="379" id="settlers.c0.p379"><s>"I take this to be a plague of Egypt that that boy has brought upon us.</s> <s>It is his doing; and you will see that, if you will just look down from where I stand, and watch him making friends with them all."</s> </p>

<p pid="380" id="settlers.c0.p380"><s>Mildred's eyes were on her brother's face as he stood where Ailwin desired him, watching Roger.</s> <s>After looking very thoughtful for some moments, he turned and exclaimed,--</s> </p>

<p pid="381" id="settlers.c0.p381"><s>"There is not one word of sense in it all, Mildred.</s> <s>There is a wonderful number of live things there, to be sure; and here, too, all over the roof--if you look.</s> <s>But Roger is not making friends with them.</s> <s>He is teasing them--hurting all he can get hold of.</s> <s>I think the creatures have come up here because the water has driven them out of their holes; and that there would have been quite as many if Roger had been drowned in the carr.</s> <s>They have nothing to do with Roger, or the plagues of Egypt, Mildred.</s> <s>Don't believe a word of it."</s> </p>

<p pid="382" id="settlers.c0.p382"><s>"Then I wish Ailwin would not say such things," replied Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="383" id="settlers.c0.p383"><s>Ailwin persisted that time would show what Roger was--to which they all agreed.</s> <s>Oliver observed that meanwhile Ailwin, who was the oldest person among them, should not try to frighten a little girl, who was the youngest of all, except George.</s> <s>Ailwin said she should keep her own thoughts; though, to be sure, she need not always say what they were to everybody.</s> </p>

<p pid="384" id="settlers.c0.p384"><s>"About this cow," thought Oliver, aloud.</s> <s>"We must plan some way to feed her."</s> </p>

<p pid="385" id="settlers.c0.p385"><s>"Take care!" exclaimed Mildred, as he began to descend the stairs.</s> <s>But the words were scarcely out of her mouth when her brother called to her that the water had sunk.</s> <s>She ran to see, and saw, with her own eyes, that the water did not quite come up to the wet mark it had left on the wall of the stairs.</s> <s>Ailwin thought but little of it--it was such a trifle; and Oliver allowed that it might be a mere accident, arising from the flood having found some new vent about the house; but still, the water had sunk; and that was a sight full of hope.</s> </p>

<p pid="386" id="settlers.c0.p386"><s>"Have you heard the cow low, Roger?" asked Oliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="387" id="settlers.c0.p387"><s>"Yes, to be sure.</s> <s>She may well low; for she must be hungry enough."</s> </p>

<p pid="388" id="settlers.c0.p388"><s>"And wet and cold enough, too, poor thing!</s> <s>I am going to see whether, I can find out exactly where she is, and whether we cannot do something for her."</s> </p>

<p pid="389" id="settlers.c0.p389"><s>Ailwin called down-stairs to Oliver, to say that there was a washtub floating about in the room they had slept in.</s> <s>If he could find it, he might row himself about in that, in the chambers, instead of always wading in the water, catching his death of cold.</s> </p>

<p pid="390" id="settlers.c0.p390"><s>Oliver took the hint, and presently appeared in the tub, rowing himself with a slip of the wood he had brought over from the Red-hill.</s> <s>Roger stared at him as he rowed himself out of one chamber, and opened the door of another, entering it in fine style.</s> <s>Roger presently followed to see what was doing, and perhaps to try how he liked a voyage in a tub in a large chamber.</s> </p>

<p pid="391" id="settlers.c0.p391"><s>"I see her," cried Oliver, from the window.</s> <s>"I see poor cow's head, and the ridge of her back above water."</s> </p>

<p pid="392" id="settlers.c0.p392"><s>Roger came splashing to the window to look, and jumped into the tub, making it sink a good deal; but it held both the boys very well.</s> <s>Roger thought the cow very stupid that she did not get upon the great dunghill behind her, which would keep her whole body out of the water.</s> <s>Oliver thought that, as the dunghill was behind her, she could not see it.</s> <s>He wished he could go, and put her in mind of it.</s> <s>He thought he would try to cross in the tub, if he could so connect it with the window as that it might be drawn back, in case of his being unable to pass the little current that there was between the house and the ruins of the yard-buildings--of which little remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="393" id="settlers.c0.p393"><s>"I'll go, too," said Roger.</s> </p>

<p pid="394" id="settlers.c0.p394"><s>"Either you will go, or I," said Oliver.</s> <s>"One must stay to manage the rope, in case of the tub upsetting.</s> <s>You had better let me go, Roger, because poor cow knows me."</s> </p>

<p pid="395" id="settlers.c0.p395"><s>Roger, however, chose to go.</s> <s>Oliver asked him whether he could milk a cow; because some milk must be got for George, if possible.</s> <s>He said, very gravely, that his poor little brother would die, he thought, if they could not get milk for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="396" id="settlers.c0.p396"><s>Roger laughed at the doubt whether he could milk cows.</s> <s>He did it every day of his life, when fishing and fowling, with his uncle, in the carr.</s> <s>Oliver now guessed how it was that the milk of their good cow had sometimes unaccountably run short.</s> <s>Ailwin had observed that this never happened but when the Redfurns were in the neighbourhood; and she had always insisted upon it that they had bewitched the cow.</s> <s>Oliver knew that she would say so now.</s> <s>He said so much, and said it so seriously, about the necessity of milk for little George, that he thought not even a Redfurn could have the heart to drink up all the milk.</s> <s>He gave Roger a brown pitcher for the milk, and helped, very cleverly, to fasten the cord to the tub.</s> <s>They passed the cord through the back of a heavy old-fashioned chair that stood in the room, lest any sudden pull should throw Oliver out of the window; he then established himself on the window-sill, above the water, to manage his line, and watch what Roger would do.</s> </p>

<p pid="397" id="settlers.c0.p397"><s>Roger pulled very skilfully;--much more so, from his strength and from practice, than Oliver could have done.</s> <s>He avoided logs of wood, trees, and other heavy things that floated past; and this was nearly all he did till the line had quite run out, so that he could not be carried any further down.</s> <s>Then he began diligently working his way up towards the cow.</s> <s>He had got half-way to his object, when he paused a moment, and then changed his course--to Oliver's surprise; for the thing which appeared to have attracted his attention was a small copper boiler.</s> <s>Plenty of such things swept past before, and nobody had thought of wanting them.</s> <s>It was plain, however, that Roger had a fancy for this particular copper boiler; for he carefully waylaid it, and arrested it with his paddle.</s> <s>Oliver then saw that some live animal leaped from the boiler into the tub.</s> <s>He saw Roger seize the boiler, and take it into the tub; catch up the animal, whatever it might be, and nurse it in his arms; and then take something out of his pocket, and stoop down.</s> <s>Oliver was pretty sure he was killing something with his knife.</s> </p>

<p pid="398" id="settlers.c0.p398"><s>Whatever Roger was doing he had soon done.</s> <s>By this time he had again been carried down as far as the line would allow; and the additional weight he had now on board his tub made it harder work for him to paddle up again.</s> <s>He did it, however, and brought his odd little boat into still water, between the dunghill and the cow.</s> <s>After looking about him for a while, he threw out the boiler and the pitcher upon the dunghill, seized a pitchfork which was stuck upright in it, and, his craft being thus lightened, made for the ruins of the cart shed and stable.</s> </p>

<p pid="399" id="settlers.c0.p399"><s>Of these buildings there remained only wrecks of the walls, and a few beams and rafters standing up in the air, or lying across each other, without any thatch to cover them.</s> <s>Something must be left inside, however; for Roger was busy with his pitchfork.</s> <s>This something must be valuable, too; for Roger, after carefully feeling the depth, jumped out of the tub, and went on filling it, while he stood in the water.</s> <s>Oliver thought this very daring, till, glancing at the cow, he was sure he saw more of her neck and back; and examining the wall of the house, he perceived that the flood had sunk some inches since Roger began to cross.</s> </p>

<p pid="400" id="settlers.c0.p400"><s>When the tub was heaped up with what looked like wet straw, Roger pushed it before him towards the cow, carefully feeling his way, but never sinking so much as to have the water above his shoulders.</s> </p>

<p pid="401" id="settlers.c0.p401"><s>"Capital!</s> <s>Now that is clever!" said Oliver, aloud, as he sat at the window, and saw what Roger was about.</s> <s>"He is going to lift her up out of the water.</s> <s>How she struggles to help herself!</s> <s>She knows there is somebody caring for her; and she will do what she can for herself."</s> </p>

<p pid="402" id="settlers.c0.p402"><s>This was true.</s> <s>Roger thrust the straw he had brought under the cow, with his pitchfork.</s> <s>He had to bring three loads before she could raise her whole body; but then she stood, poor thing!</s> <s>With only her trembling legs in the water.</s> <s>Roger turned her head so that she saw the dunghill just behind her, and with some encouragement, made one more vigorous scramble to reach it.</s> <s>She succeeded; and Roger whipped up the pitcher, and was certainly trying to milk her.</s> <s>She could not, however, be prevented from lying down.</s> <s>Oliver was more angry than he had almost ever been in his life, when he saw Roger kick her repeatedly, in different parts of her body, pull her by the tail, and haul up her head with a rope he had found in the stable.</s> <s>The poor cow never attempted to rise; and it was clear that she wanted comfort, and not ill-usage.</s> <s>Oliver determined that, when Roger came back, he would not speak a word to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="403" id="settlers.c0.p403"><s>Roger set about returning presently, when he found that nothing could be got from the cow.</s> <s>He took his boiler on board, and pulled himself in by the line, without troubling himself to paddle.</s> </p>

<p pid="404" id="settlers.c0.p404"><s>When he came in at the window, he threw down the pitcher, swearing at himself for the trouble he had taken about a good-for-nothing beast that had been standing starving in the water till she had not a drop of milk to give.</s> <s>He looked at Oliver, as if rather surprised that he did not speak; but Oliver took no notice of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="405" id="settlers.c0.p405"><s>It was a hare that Roger had in his boiler,--a hare that had, no doubt, leaped into the boiler when pressed by a still more urgent danger than sailing down the stream in such a boat.</s> <s>Roger had cut her throat with his pocket-knife; and there she lay in her own blood.</s> </p>

<p pid="406" id="settlers.c0.p406"><s>"Don't you touch that," said Roger, as he landed his booty upon the window-sill.</s> <s>"If you lay a finger on that, it will be the worse for you.</s> <s>They are mine--both puss and the boiler."</s> </p>

<p pid="407" id="settlers.c0.p407"><s>Still Oliver did not speak.</s> <s>He wondered what Roger meant to do with these things, if nobody else was to touch them.</s> </p>

<p pid="408" id="settlers.c0.p408"><s>Roger soon made it clear what his intentions were.</s> <s>He whistled to his dog, which scampered down-stairs to him from the top of the house; put dog, puss, and boiler into the clothes' basket, and pulled himself over with them to the Red-hill, taking care to carry the tinder-box with him.</s> <s>There he made a fire, skinned and cooked his hare, and, with his dog, made a feast of it, under a tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="409" id="settlers.c0.p409"><s>Nobody grudged him his feast; though the children were sorry to find that any one could be so selfish.</s> <s>Ailwin was glad to be rid of him, on any terms; and, as soon as Oliver was sure that he was occupied for some time to come, so that he would not be returning to make mischief, he resolved to go over to the cow, and give her something better than kicks;--food, if, as he thought, he could procure some.</s> <s>Saying nothing to any one, he tied the tub-line to a bed-post, as being more trustworthy still than the heavy chair, and carried with him the great knife that the meat had been cut with the evening before.</s> <s>He made for the stable first, and joined the rope he knew to be there to his line, so as to make it twice the length it was before.</s> <s>He could now reach the field behind the stable, where the corn, just turning from green to yellow, had been standing high at this hour yesterday.</s> <s>He had to paddle very carefully here, lest his tub should be knocked to pieces against the stone wall.</s> <s>But the wall, though not altogether thrown down, had so many breaches made in it, that he found himself in the field, without exactly knowing whether he had come through the gate-posts or through the wall.</s> <s>He lost no time in digging with his paddle; and, as he had hoped, he turned up ears of corn from under the water, which he could catch hold of, a handful at a time, and cut off with his knife.</s> <s>It was very tiresome, slow work; and sometimes he was near losing his paddle, and sometimes his knife.</s> <s>He persevered, however: now resting for a minute or two, and then eating a few of the ears, and thinking that only very hungry people could swallow them, soaked as they were with bad water.</s> <s>He ate more than he would have done, remembering that the more he took now, the less he should want of the portion he meant to carry to the house, when he should have fed the cow.</s> <s>He hoped they should obtain some better food; but, if no flour was to be had, and no other vegetable than this, it would be better than none.</s> </p>

<p pid="410" id="settlers.c0.p410"><s>When he reached the cow, she devoured the heads of corn ravenously.</s> <s>She could not have appeared better satisfied with the sweetest spring grass.</s> <s>It was a pleasure to see her eyes as she lay, receiving her food from Oliver's hand.</s> <s>He emptied out all he had brought beside her, and patted her, saying he hoped she would give George some milk in the afternoon, in return for what had been done for her now.</s> </p>

<p pid="411" id="settlers.c0.p411"><s>Oliver felt so tired and weak when he got home with his tub half full of soaked corn ears, that he felt as if he could not do anything more.</s> <s>He was very near crying when he found that there was not a morsel to eat; that the very water was too bad to drink; and that there was no fire, from Roger having carried off the tinder-box.</s> <s>But George was crying with hunger; and that made Oliver ashamed to do the same, and put him upon thinking what was to be done next.</s> </p>

<p pid="412" id="settlers.c0.p412"><s>Ailwin was the only person who, being as strong as Roger could have got anything from him by force; and there was no use in asking Ailwin to cross the bridge-rope, or to do anything which would bring her nearer to the boy she feared so much.</s> <s>Besides that, Roger had carried over the clothes' basket without leaving any line to pull it back by.</s> <s>Oliver felt that he (if he were only a little less hungry and tired) could make the trip in a sack, or a tub, or even a kettle; but a tall woman like Ailwin could cross in nothing smaller than the missing clothes' basket.</s> <s>It was clear that Oliver alone could go; and that he must go for the tinder-box before any comfort was to be had.</s> </p>

<p pid="413" id="settlers.c0.p413"><s>He made up his mind to this, therefore; and having, with Ailwin's help, slung the useful tub upon the bridge-rope, so that he might start the first moment that Roger should be out of sight or asleep, he rested himself in the window, watching what passed on the Red-hill.</s> <s>He observed that Roger seemed quite secure that no one could follow him, as he had carried off the basket.</s> <s>There he lay, near the fire, eating the meat he had broiled, and playing with his dog.</s> <s>It seemed to the hungry watchers as if he meant to lie there all day.</s> <s>After awhile, however, he rose, and sauntered towards the trees, among which he disappeared, as if going to the other side of the hill, to play, or to set his dog upon game.</s> </p>

<p pid="414" id="settlers.c0.p414"><s>Oliver was off, sliding along the bridge-rope in his tub.</s> <s>He did not forget to carry the line with which to bring back the basket.</s> <s>It seemed to him that Roger intended to live by himself on the Red-hill; and to this none of the party had any objection.</s> <s>He had swum over to the house once, when the stream was higher and more rapid than now; and he could come again, if he found himself really in want of anything; so that nobody need be anxious for him.</s> <s>Meantime, no one at the house desired his company.</s> <s>Oliver therefore took with him a blanket and a rug, and a knife and fork for his accommodation.</s> </p>

<p pid="415" id="settlers.c0.p415"><s>He alighted under the beech without difficulty, and laid down the articles he brought under the tree, where Roger would be sure to see them.</s> <s>He took the flint and the tinder from the tinder-box, and pocketed them, leaving the steel and the box for Roger's use, as there were knives at home, and Roger might perhaps find a flint on the hill.</s> <s>There were plenty in the quarry.</s> <s>Oliver knew he must be quick; but he could not help looking round for something to eat,--some one of the many animals and birds that he knew to be on the hill, and heard moving about him on every side.</s> <s>But he had no means of catching any.</s> <s>The bones of the hare were lying about, picked quite clean by the dog; but not a morsel of meat was left in sight.</s> </p>

<p pid="416" id="settlers.c0.p416"><s>Something very precious, however, caught Oliver's eye;--a great heap of pebbly gravel thrown up by the flood.</s> <s>The water in the Levels was usually so bad that the settlers had to filter it; and Oliver knew that no water was purer than that which had been filtered through gravel.</s> <s>He believed now that poor George could have a good drink of water, at least; and he scooped up with his hands enough gravel to half fill the tub.</s> <s>It took a long time to heap up as much as he could carry upon the rug; and then it was hard work to empty it into the tub; and he fancied every moment that he heard Roger coming.</s> <s>It was a pity he did not know that Roger had fallen fast asleep in the sun, on the other side of the hill; and that his dog lay winking beside him, not thinking of stirring.</s> </p>

<p pid="417" id="settlers.c0.p417"><s>One thing more must be had;--chips for fuel.</s> <s>When Oliver had got enough of these, and of sticks too, he found courage and strength to stay a few minutes more, to make up such a fire for Roger as would probably last till after he should have discovered the loss of the flint, and so prevent his being without fire till he could find another flint.</s> <s>In order to give him a broad hint, Oliver spread out the blanket on the ground, and set the tinder-box in the middle of it, where it would be sure to invite attention.</s> <s>He then climbed into the tub, and was glad to be off, drawing the basket with the fire-wood after him.</s> </p>

<p pid="418" id="settlers.c0.p418" type="speech"><s>"Here, Ailwin," said he, faintly, as he reached the window, <qs/>"take the flint and the tinder, and the wood in the basket, and make a fire.</s> <s>I have brought you nothing to eat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="419" id="settlers.c0.p419"><s>"No need!" said Ailwin, with an uncommonly merry countenance.</s> </p>

<p pid="420" id="settlers.c0.p420"><s>"You must broil the green corn, unless we can manage to get a fowl from across the yard.</s> <s>But I really cannot go any more errands till I am rested," said Oliver, dismally.</s> </p>

<p pid="421" id="settlers.c0.p421"><s>"No need, Oliver dear!" said Ailwin again.</s> </p>

<p pid="422" id="settlers.c0.p422" type="speech"><s>"What do you think we have found to eat?" cried Mildred, from the stairs.--<qs/>"What is the matter with him, Ailwin?</s> <s>Why does not he speak?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="423" id="settlers.c0.p423"><s>"He is so tired, he does not know what to do," said Ailwin.</s> <s>"No, don't get down into the water again, dear.</s> <s>I'll carry you.</s> <s>Put your arm round my neck, and I'll carry you."</s> </p>

<p pid="424" id="settlers.c0.p424"><s>And the good-natured woman carried him up to the roof, and laid him down on a bundle of bedding there, promising to bring him breakfast presently.</s> <s>She threw an apron over his head, to cover it from the hot sun, and bade him lie still, and not think of anything till she came.</s> </p>

<p pid="425" id="settlers.c0.p425"><s>"Only one thing," said Oliver.</s> <s>"Take particular care of the gravel in the tub."</s> </p>

<p pid="426" id="settlers.c0.p426"><s>"Gravel!" exclaimed Ailwin.</s> <s>"The fowls eat gravel; but I don't see that we can.</s> <s>However, you shall have your way, Oliver."</s> </p>

<p pid="427" id="settlers.c0.p427"><s>The tired boy was asleep in a moment.</s> <s>He knew nothing more till he felt vexed at somebody's trying to wake him.</s> <s>It was Mildred.</s> <s>He heard her say,--</s> </p>

<p pid="429" id="settlers.c0.p429"><s>He tried to rouse himself, and sat up; but his eyes were so dim, and the light so dazzling, that he could not see, at first, what Mildred had in her hands.</s> <s>It was one of her mother's best china plates,--one of the set that was kept in a closet up-stairs; and upon it was a nice brown toasted fish, steaming hot.</s> </p>

<p pid="430" id="settlers.c0.p430"><s>"Is that for me?" asked Oliver, rubbing his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="431" id="settlers.c0.p431"><s>"Yes, indeed, for who but you?" said Ailwin, whose smiling face popped up from the stairs.</s> <s>"Who deserves it, if you do not, I should like to know?</s> <s>It is not so good as I could have wished, though, Oliver.</s> <s>I could not broil it, for want of butter and everything; and we have no salt, you know.</s> <s>But, come!</s> <s>Eat it, such as it is.</s> <s>Come, begin!"</s> </p>

<p pid="432" id="settlers.c0.p432"><s>"But have you all got some too?" asked the hungry boy, as he eyed the fish.</s> </p>

<p pid="433" id="settlers.c0.p433"><s>"Oh, yes,--George and all," said Mildred.</s> <s>"We ate ours first, because you were so sound asleep, we did not like to wake you."</s> </p>

<p pid="434" id="settlers.c0.p434"><s>"How long have I been asleep?" asked Oliver, beginning heartily upon his fish.</s> <s>"How could you get this nice fish?</s> <s>How busy you must have been all this time that I have been asleep!"</s> </p>

<p pid="435" id="settlers.c0.p435"><s>"All this time!" exclaimed Mildred.</s> <s>"Why, you have been asleep only half an hour; hardly so much.</s> <s>We have only just lighted the fire, and cooked the fish, and fed Geordie, and put him to sleep, and got our own breakfast;--and we were not long about that,--we were so very hungry!</s> <s>That is all we have done since you went to sleep."</s> </p>

<p pid="436" id="settlers.c0.p436"><s>"It seems a great deal for half an hour," said Oliver.</s> <s>"How good this fish is!</s> <s>Where did you get it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="437" id="settlers.c0.p437"><s>"I found it on the stairs.</s> <s>Ah!</s> <s>I thought you would not believe it; but we shall find more, I dare say, as the water sinks; and then you will believe what you see."</s> </p>

<p pid="439" id="settlers.c0.p439"><s>"The same way that the water got there, I suppose, and the poor little drowned pig that lay close by the same place.</s> <s>There was a whole heap of fish washed up at the turn of the stairs; enough for us all to-day.</s> <s>Ailwin said we must eat them first, because the pig will keep.</s> <s>Such a nice little clean sucking-pig!"</s> </p>

<p pid="440" id="settlers.c0.p440"><s>"That puts me in mind of the poor sow," said Oliver.</s> <s>"I forgot her when we were busy about the cow.</s> <s>I am afraid she is drowned or starved before this; but we must see about it."</s> </p>

<p pid="448" id="settlers.c0.p448"><s>He had hitherto led a wandering life, having no home duties, no school to go to, no trade to work at,--no garden, or other pleasure, to fix him to one spot.</s> <s>He had gone, with his uncle, from sporting on the moors, in one season of the year, to sporting in the marshes in another; and, wild as was this way of life, it made his will so much wilder, that he was always wishing for more liberty still.</s> <s>When his aunt had desired him to watch the kettle, as it hung over the fire near the tent, or asked him to help her in shaking out their bedding, or cleaning their utensils, he had turned sulky, and wished that he lived alone, where he need not be plagued about other people's affairs.</s> <s>When his uncle had ordered him to attend at a certain spot and hour, with nets or a gun, he had been wont to feel himself seized with a sudden desire to wander in an opposite direction, or to lie half asleep in the sun, too lazy to work at all.</s> <s>When he had played truant, and returned late to the tent, and found nothing better left to eat than a dry crust of bread, or the cold remains of a mess of fish, he had frequently thought how pleasant it would be to have the best of everything for himself, and only his dog to eat up the rest.</s> <s>So this boy had often felt and thought; and so would many think and feel, perhaps, if there were many as forlorn and friendless as he, with no one to love and be loved by.</s> <s>Though he had had an uncle and aunt, he had never had a friend.</s> <s>He knew that they cared about him only because he could help to keep the tent, and take the game; and, feeling this, it was irksome to him to be under their orders.</s> </p>

<p pid="449" id="settlers.c0.p449"><s>The time was now come for which he had so often longed.</s> <s>He was his own master completely.</s> <s>There was nobody near who could order or compel him to do anything; while he, on his part, had an obedient servant in his dog.</s> <s>The sky was blue and warm overhead, and the trees cast a pleasant shade.</s> <s>The Red-hill was now an island, which he had all to himself; and it was richly stocked with game, for his food and sport.</s> <s>Here he could have his own way, and be completely happy.</s> </p>

<p pid="450" id="settlers.c0.p450" type="speech"><s>Such was Roger's idea when he stole the tinder-box, and crossed to the hill; and this was what he said to himself as he cooked his meal, and when he lay down after it on the grass, with the bees humming round him, and the sound of the waters being now a pleasant ripple, instead of the rush and roar of yesterday.</s> <s>He desired his dog to lie down, and not disturb him; and he took this opportunity to change the animal's name.</s> <s>Stephen Redfurn, taking up the quarrel of the day against the bishops, would have the dog called <qs/>"Bishop,"<qe/> and nothing else.</s> <s>Roger had always wished to call him <qs/>"Spy;"<qe/> but Bishop would never answer to the name of Spy, or even seem to hear it.</s> <s>Now, however, Bishop was to be Spy, as there was no one here to indulge the dog with his old name; and Spy was told so many times over, and with all the devices that could be thought of for impressing the fact on his memory.</s> </p>

<p pid="451" id="settlers.c0.p451"><s>This lesson being given, Roger shut his eyes, and thought he would sleep as long as he chose; but, in the first place, he found himself too much heated for sleep.</s> <s>He considered that it was no wonder, after broiling himself in making a fire to broil his hare.</s> <s>He wished animals ran about ready cooked--as fruits grow on the sunny side of trees.</s> <s>It was too bad to have to bustle and toil for an hour, to get ready what was eaten in ten minutes; and it just passed through his mind that, whatever Nan Redfurn might have sometimes said and done to him, she had usually saved him all trouble in cooking, and had had his meals ready for him whenever he chose to be at the tent at meal times.</s> <s>He rose, and thought he could find a cooler place, further under the trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="452" id="settlers.c0.p452"><s>He did so, and again lay down.</s> <s>Sleep began to steal over him; and, at the same time, the thought crept into his mind that he should never more see Stephen Redfurn.</s> <s>The ideas that come when one is dropping asleep are very vivid; and this one startled Roger so, that Spy found it out, and pricked up his ears, as if at some alarm.</s> <s>This thought would not go away; for it so happened that the last words that Stephen and Roger had spoken together were angry ones.</s> <s>Stephen had ordered Roger to carry the fry they had fished for manure to a field, where he had promised to deposit it by a certain time.</s> <s>Roger had been sure that the fish would be better for lying in the sun a while longer, and refused to touch it.</s> <s>No matter which was right about the manure; both were wrong in being angry.</s> <s>Stephen had said that Roger was a young rascal, who would never come to good; and Roger had looked impertinently in his uncle's face, while whistling to the dog to come with him, and make sport among the water-fowl.</s> <s>It was that face--that countenance of his uncle's, as he had last seen it, which was before Roger's eyes now, as he lay dozing.</s> <s>With it came the angry tones of Stephen's voice, saying that he would never come to good.</s> <s>Mixed and confused with this was the roar of a coming flood, and a question (how and whence spoken he knew not) whether his uncle might not possibly have been saved, if he had not, against orders, carried away Bishop--for the dog was still Bishop in his master's dreams.</s> </p>

<p pid="453" id="settlers.c0.p453"><s>Roger started bolt upright, and looked about him.</s> <s>He felt very tired; but he thought he would not lie down again just yet.</s> <s>It was odd that he could not get sound asleep, so tired as he was.</s> <s>If he should not sleep better than this at night, what should he do?</s> <s>He wished he had some more of that woman's cherry-brandy.</s> <s>He had slept sound enough after drinking that.</s> <s>It was well for Roger that he was not now within reach of intoxicating liquors--the state of his mind would probably have made a drunkard of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="454" id="settlers.c0.p454"><s>His mind ran strangely on his uncle, and his uncle's last looks and words, even as he stood wide awake, and staring at the bee-hives.</s> <s>A rustle in the briars behind him made him jump as if he had been shot.</s> <s>It was only a partridge taking wing.</s> </p>

<p pid="455" id="settlers.c0.p455"><s>"Whirr away!" said Roger to her.</s> <s>"You can't go far.</s> <s>You will have to light again upon my island.</s> <s>You all belong to me--you swarming creatures!</s> <s>You may run about awhile, and flutter away a bit; but you will all belong to me at last, with Spy to help me.</s> <s>I'll have some sport, now.</s> <s>Here, Spy!</s> <s>Spy!"</s> </p>

<p pid="456" id="settlers.c0.p456"><s>Spy had disappeared, and did not come when called.</s> <s>A whistle brought him, however, at last.</s> <s>He came out of the thicket, licking his chops.</s> <s>Being commanded to bring his game, he soon produced two rabbits.</s> <s>It was easy work for the dog to catch them; for the poor creatures had no holes here.</s> <s>They had come to this raised ground from a warren some way off, where they had been soaked out of their holes.</s> </p>

<p pid="457" id="settlers.c0.p457"><s>Spy was praised for everything but not answering to his name.</s> <s>For that he was lectured, and then sent off again, to try what he could find.</s> <s>He brought in prey of various kinds; for he could not stir among the trees without starting some.</s> <s>During the fun, as Roger thought it, while the terrified birds were fluttering among the branches of the trees, and the scared animals bursting through the thicket, Roger resolved that he would not plague himself with any more thoughts of Stephen and Nan.</s> <s>If they were drowned, it was none of his doing; and, as for Stephen's anger yesterday, there was nothing new in that; Stephen was angry every day of his life.</s> <s>He would not be scared out of his sleep any more by nonsense.</s> <s>He would not give up having his own way to see Stephen and Nan under these very trees; and, as he had got his own way at last, he would enjoy it.</s> </p>

<p pid="458" id="settlers.c0.p458"><s>This mood went on till there was such a heap of dead animals, that Roger began to think whether he could skin them all, and clean their skins, in such hot weather as this, before they were unfit for any use.</s> <s>As for eating them, here was twenty times as much food as could be eaten while it was good.</s> <s>He did just remember the children and Ailwin, and how much they probably wanted food; but he settled that it was no business of his; and he was not going to trouble himself to leave his island for anybody.</s> <s>He would call in Spy, and tie him up; for there must be no more game killed to-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="459" id="settlers.c0.p459"><s>Spy did not come for any calling,--for anything short of the well-known whistle, as Roger would not utter the name of Bishop.</s> <s>Roger grew very angry at being obeyed no better than this; and his last whistle was so shrill that the dog seemed to know what it threatened, refused to answer it as long as he dared, and then came unwillingly, with fear in every attitude.</s> <s>He gave a low whine when he saw his master; as he had good reason to do.</s> <s>Roger tied him to a tree, and then gave loose to his passion.</s> <s>He thrashed the dog with a switch till the poor creature's whine was heard and pitied by the children and Ailwin on their house-top; and there is no knowing how long the whipping might not have gone on, if the animal had not at last turned furious, and snapped at Roger in a way which made him think of giving over, and finding something else to do with his sovereignty.</s> </p>

<p pid="460" id="settlers.c0.p460"><s>He found it was rather dull work, so far, having all his own way, in an island of his own.</s> <s>At last, he bethought himself of an amusement he had been fond of before he lived so much in the moors and the carrs.</s> <s>He bethought himself of bird's-nesting.</s> <s>It was too late for eggs; but he thought the bird-families might not have all dispersed.</s> <s>Here were plenty of trees, and they must be full of birds; for, though they were silent to-day (he did wish the place was not quite so silent!) they sometimes sent their warblings so far over the carr, that Nan Redfurn would mention them in the tent.</s> <s>He would see what ailed them, that they would not give him any music to-day.</s> <s>By incessant cooing, he obtained an answer from one solitary pigeon; which he took advantage of to climb the tree, and look for the nest.</s> <s>He found a nest; but there was nothing in it.</s> <s>He climbed several trees, and found abundance of nests; but all deserted.</s> <s>Except his solitary pigeon (which presently vanished), there appeared to be not a winged creature in all those trees.</s> <s>The birds had been frightened away by the roar of the flood of yesterday; and, perhaps, by seeing the fields, to which they had been wont to resort for their food, all turned into a waste of muddy waters.</s> </p>

<p pid="461" id="settlers.c0.p461"><s>Roger threw to the ground every empty nest he found, from the common inability of a boy to keep his hands off a bird's-nest.</s> <s>When he was tired of climbing trees, he picked up all the scattered nests, and laid them in a long row on the grass.</s> <s>They looked dismal enough.</s> <s>It is disagreeable to see a range of houses left half-built (such as may be seen in the neighbourhood of large towns), with the doorways gaping, and the window-spaces empty, and roofs hardly covering in the dark inside; but such a row of houses is less dismal than Roger's array of birds'-nests.</s> <s>There is something in the very make of a bird's-nest which rouses thoughts of blue or red-spotted eggs, of callow young birds, with their large hungry eyes and beaks, or of twittering fledglings, training for a summer life of pleasure.</s> <s>To see, instead of these, their silent empty habitations, extended in a long row, would be enough to make any one dull and sad.</s> <s>So Roger found.</s> <s>He kicked them into a heap under a tree, and thought that they would make a fine crackling fire.</s> <s>He would burn them, every one.</s> </p>

<p pid="462" id="settlers.c0.p462"><s>While he was wondering whether any birds would come back to miss their nests, it struck him that he had not thought how he was to pass the night.</s> <s>It was nothing new to him to sleep in the open air.</s> <s>He liked it best at this season.</s> <s>But he had usually had a rug to lie upon, with the tent over him; or a blanket; or, at worst, he had a sack to creep into.</s> <s>The clothes he had on were old and thin; and as he looked at them, it made him angry to think that he was not to have everything as he liked it, after all.</s> <s>Here he should have to pass a cold night, and with nothing between him and the hard ground.</s> <s>He thought of gathering leaves, moss, and high grass, to roll himself up in, like a squirrel in its hole; but the trouble was what he did not like.</s> <s>He stood listlessly thinking how much trouble it would cost to collect moss and leaves for the purpose; and, while he was so thinking, he went on pelting his dog with birds'-nests, and seeing how the angry dog, unable to get loose, snapped up and shook to pieces the nests which fell within his reach.</s> </p>

<p pid="463" id="settlers.c0.p463"><s>Roger knew that he ought to be skinning some of the dead animals, if he really meant to secure all their skins, before it was too late; but this also was troublesome.</s> <s>Instead of doing this, he went round the hill, to see what the Linacres were about, resolving by no means to appear to see them, if they should be making signs from the window to have the things back again that he had carried away.</s> <s>On coming out of the shade on that side of the hill, he was surprised to see smoke still going up from his fire, considering that the fire was nearly out when he had left it.</s> <s>Something more strange met his eye as he ran forward.</s> <s>There was the nice clean blanket spread out on the ground, with the tinder-box in the middle.</s> </p>

<p pid="464" id="settlers.c0.p464"><s>"Somebody has been here!" cried Roger, much offended.</s> <s>"What business has anybody in my island?</s> <s>Coming when my back is turned!</s> <s>If I had only heard them coming to meddle--!"</s> </p>

<p pid="465" id="settlers.c0.p465"><s>Just then, his eye fell on the rug, blanket, and knife and fork left by Oliver,--the very accommodation he had been wishing for, and more.</s> <s>When he felt the thick warm rug, he gave over his anger at some one having entered his island without his leave, and, for a moment, again felt pleased and happy.</s> <s>But when he saw that the bridge-basket was gone-- that other people had the means of coming in upon him when they pleased--he was more angry than he had been all day.</s> </p>

<p pid="466" id="settlers.c0.p466" type="speech"><s>"However," thought he, <qs/>"I got over to the house before anyone else crossed the water, and I can do the same again whenever I please.</s> <s>I have only to swim over with Spy, and bring away anything I like, while they are busy on the other side, about their good-for-nothing cow, or something.</s> <s>That will be tit-for-tat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="467" id="settlers.c0.p467"><s>He was doubly mistaken here.</s> <s>His going over to steal comforts from the Linacres would not be tit-for-tat for Oliver's coming over to his father's hill, to bring away his mother's clothes basket, and leave comforts for an unwelcome visitor!</s> <s>Neither could Roger now enter the Linacres' dwelling when he pleased, by swimming the stream.</s> <s>He saw this when he examined and considered.</s> <s>The water had sunk so as to show a few inches of the top of the entrance-door and lower windows.</s> <s>It was not high enough to allow of his getting in at the upper window, as he did yesterday; and too high for entrance below.</s> <s>The stream appeared to be as rapid and strong as ever; and it shot its force through the carr as vehemently as at first; for it was almost, or quite as deep as ever.</s> <s>It had worn away soil at the bottom of its channel, to nearly or quite the same depth as it had sunk at the surface; so that it was still working against the walls and foundation of the house, and the soil of the hill, with as much force as during the first hour.</s> <s>When Roger examined the red precipice from which he looked down upon the rushing stream, he perceived that not a yard of Linacres' garden could now be in existence.</s> <s>That garden, with its flourishing vegetables, its rare, gay, sweet flowers, and its laden fruit trees,--that garden which he and Stephen could not help admiring, while they told everybody that it had no business in the middle of their carr,--that garden, its earth and its plants, was all spread in ruins over the marsh; and instead of it would be found, if the waters could be dried up, a deep, gravelly, stony watercourse, or a channel of red mud.</s> <s>Roger wondered whether the boy and girl were aware of this fate of their garden; or whether they supposed that everything stood fast and in order under the waters.</s> <s>He wanted to point out the truth to them; and looked up to the chamber window, in hopes that they might be watching him from it.</s> <s>No one was there, however.</s> <s>On glancing higher, he saw them sitting within the balustrade on the roof.</s> <s>They were all looking another way, and not appearing to think of him at all.</s> <s>He watched them for a long while; but they never turned towards the Red-hill.</s> <s>He could have made them hear by calling; but they might think he wished to be with them, or wanted something from them, instead of understanding that he desired to tell them that their pretty garden was destroyed.</s> <s>So he began to settle with himself which of his dead game he would have for supper, and then fed his fire, in order to cook it.</s> <s>He now thought that he should have liked a bird for supper,--a pheasant or partridge instead of a rabbit or leveret; of which he had plenty.</s> <s>He felt it very provoking that he had neither a net nor a gun, for securing feathered game, when there was so much on the hill; so that he must put up with four-footed game, when he had rather have had a bird.</s> <s>There was no bread either, or vegetables; but he minded that less, because neither of these were at hand, and he had often lived for a long time together on animal food.</s> <s>During the whole time of his listless preparations for cooking his supper, he glanced up occasionally at the roof; but he never once saw the party look his way.</s> <s>He thought it very odd that they should care so much less about him, than he knew they did when Stephen and he came into the carr.</s> <s>They neither seemed to want him nor to fear him to-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="468" id="settlers.c0.p468"><s>At length he went to set Spy loose, in order to feed him, and to have a companion, for he felt rather dull, while seeing how busily the party on the house-top were talking.</s> <s>When he returned with Spy, the sun had set, and there was no one on the house-top.</s> <s>A faint light from the chamber window told that Ailwin and the children were there.</s> <s>Roger wondered how they had managed to kindle a fire, while he had the tinder-box.</s> <s>He learned the truth, soon after, by upsetting the tinder-box, as he moved the blanket.</s> <s>The steel fell out; and the flint and tinder were found to be absent.</s> <s>In his present mood he considered it prodigious impertinence to impose upon him the labour of finding a flint the next day, and the choice whether to make tinder of a bit of his shirt, or to use shavings of wood instead.</s> <s>He determined to show, meanwhile, that he had plenty of fire for to-night, and therefore heaped it up so high, that there was some danger that the lower branches of the ash under which he sat would shrivel up with the heat.</s> </p>

<p pid="469" id="settlers.c0.p469"><s>No blaze that he could make, however, could conceal from his own view the cheerful light from the chamber window.</s> <s>There was certainly a good fire within; and those who sat beside it were probably better companions to each other than Spy was to him.</s> <s>The dog was dull and would not play; and Roger himself soon felt too tired, or something, to wish to play.</s> <s>He could not conceal from himself that he should much like to be in that chamber from which the light shone, even though there was no cherry-brandy there now.</s> </p>

<p pid="470" id="settlers.c0.p470"><s>The stars were but just beginning to drop into the sky, and the waste of waters still looked yellow and bright to the west; but Roger's first day of having his own way had been quite long enough; and he spread his rug, and rolled himself in his blanket for the night.</s> <s>Spy, being invited, drew near, and lay down too.</s> <s>Roger was still overheated, from having made such an enormous fire; but he muffled up his head in his blanket, as if he was afraid lest even his dog should see that he was crying.</s> </p>

<p pid="471" id="settlers.c0.p471"><s>CHAPTER SEVEN.</s> <s>ROGER NOT HIS OWN MASTER.</s> </p>

<p pid="472" id="settlers.c0.p472"><s>More than once during the long night, Roger heard strange sounds; and Spy repeatedly raised his head, and seemed uneasy.</s> <s>Above the constant flow of the stream, there came occasionally a sort of roar, then a rumble and a splash, and the stream appeared to flow on faster.</s> <s>Once Roger rose in the belief that the house,--the firm, substantial, stone house,--was washed down.</s> <s>But it was not so.</s> <s>There was no moon at the time of night when he looked forth; but it was clear starlight; and there stood the dark mass of the building in the midst of the grey waters.</s> <s>Roger vowed he would not get up from his warm rug again, on any false alarm; and so lay till broad daylight, sometimes quite asleep, and sometimes drowsily, resolving that he would think no more of uncle Stephen, except in the day-time.</s> </p>

<p pid="473" id="settlers.c0.p473"><s>Soon after sunrise, however, a renewed rumble and splash roused him to open his eyes wide.</s> <s>What he saw made him jump up, and run to the edge of the precipice, to see all he could.</s> <s>The greater part of the roof of the house was gone; and there were cracks in the solid stone walls through which the yellow sunshine found its way.</s> <s>One portion of the wall leaned in; another leaned out towards the water.</s> <s>At first Roger expected to see the whole building crumble down into the stream, and supposed that the inhabitants might be swept quite away.</s> <s>He gazed with the strange feeling that not a creature might be now left alive in that habitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="474" id="settlers.c0.p474"><s>Roger's heart sank within him at the idea of his own solitude, if this were indeed the case.</s> <s>He had nothing to fear for his own safety.</s> <s>The Red-hill would not be swept away.</s> <s>He could live as he was for a long time to come; till some some steps should be taken for repairing the damage of the flood; till some explorers should arrive in a boat; which he had no doubt would happen soon.</s> <s>It was not about his own safety that Roger was anxious; but it frightened him to think of being entirely alone in such a place as this, with the bodies of all whom he knew best lying under the waters on every side of him.</s> <s>If he could have Oliver with him to speak to, or even little George, it would make all the difference to him.</s> <s>He really hoped they were left alive.</s> <s>When he began to consider, he perceived that the bridge-rope remained, stretched as tight as ever.</s> <s>The chamber window, and indeed all that wall of the house, looked firm and safe; and such roof as was left was over that part.</s> <s>This was natural enough, as the violence of the flood was much greater on the opposite side of the house than on the garden side.</s> <s>The staircase was safe.</s> <s>It was laid open to view very curiously; but it stood upright and steady: and, at length, to Roger's great relief, Mildred appeared upon it.</s> <s>She merely ran up to fetch something from the roof; but her step, her run and jump, was, to Roger's mind, different from what it would have been if she had been in great affliction or fear.</s> <s>In his pleasure at this, he snatched his cap from his head, and waved it: but the little girl was very busy, and she did not see him.</s> <s>It was odd, Roger said to himself, that the Linacres were always now thinking of everything but him, when formerly they could never watch him enough.</s> </p>

<p pid="475" id="settlers.c0.p475"><s>After a while he descended the bank, to fill his boiler with water.</s> <s>It was necessary to do this for some time before drinking, in order that the mud might settle.</s> <s>Even after standing for several hours, the day before, the water was far from clear; and it was very far from sweet.</s> <s>This was nothing new to Roger, however, who had been accustomed to drink water like this as often as he had been settled in the carr, though he had occasionally been allowed to mix with it some gin from his uncle's bottle.</s> <s>He was thirsty enough this morning to drink almost anything; but he did think the water in the boiler looked particularly muddy and disagreeable.</s> <s>Spy seemed as thirsty as himself, and as little disposed to drink of the stream as it ran below.</s> <s>He pranced about the boiler, as if watching for an opportunity to wet his tongue, if his master should turn his back for a minute.</s> </p>

<p pid="476" id="settlers.c0.p476"><s>The opportunity soon came; for Roger saw the bridge-basket put out of the window by Ailwin; after which, Oliver got into it.</s> <s>Ailwin handed him something, as he pulled away for the Red-hill.</s> <s>With a skip and a jump Roger ran to the beach to await him.</s> </p>

<p pid="477" id="settlers.c0.p477"><s>"Pull away!</s> <s>That's right!</s> <s>Glad to see you!" exclaimed Roger.</s> <s>"Halloo, Spy!</s> <s>Down, sir!</s> <s>Pleased to see you, Oliver."</s> </p>

<p pid="478" id="settlers.c0.p478"><s>Oliver was glad to hear these words.</s> <s>He did not know but that he might have been met by abuse and violence, for having carried home the basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="479" id="settlers.c0.p479"><s>"Would you like some milk?" asked Oliver, as he came near.</s> </p>

<p pid="480" id="settlers.c0.p480"><s>"Ay, that I should," replied Roger.</s> </p>

<p pid="481" id="settlers.c0.p481"><s>"Leave yonder water to your dog, then, and drink this," said Oliver, handing down a small tin can.</s> <s>"You must let me have the can, though.</s> <s>Almost all our kitchen things floated out through the wall, at that breach that you see, during the night.</s> <s>You must give me the can again, if you would like that I should bring you some more milk this afternoon.</s> <s>The poor cow is doing but badly, and we cannot feed her as we should like: but she has given milk enough for George this morning, with a little to spare for us and you.</s> <s>You seem to like it," he added, laughing to see how Roger smacked his lips over the draught.</s> </p>

<p pid="482" id="settlers.c0.p482"><s>"That I do.</s> <s>It is good stuff, I know," said Roger, as he drained the last drop.</s> </p>

<p pid="483" id="settlers.c0.p483"><s>"Then I will bring you some more in the afternoon, if there is any to spare from poor George's supper."</s> </p>

<p pid="484" id="settlers.c0.p484"><s>"That's a pity.</s> <s>You've enough to do, I think.</s> <s>Suppose I come over.</s> <s>Eh?"</s> </p>

<p pid="485" id="settlers.c0.p485"><s>"There is something to be said about that," replied Oliver, gravely.</s> <s>"We do not want to keep what we have to ourselves.</s> <s>We have got a chest of meal, this morning."</s> </p>

<p pid="486" id="settlers.c0.p486"><s>"A chest of meal!"</s> </p>

<p pid="487" id="settlers.c0.p487"><s>"Yes: a large chest, and not wet at all, except an inch deep all round the outside.</s> <s>We caught it just now as it was floating by; and we should like you to have some of it, as you have no bread here: but you know, Roger, you kicked our poor cow when she was too weak to stand; and you carried away our tinder-box when you knew we had no fire.</s> <s>We don't want to have you with us to do such things: and so I think I had better bring you some of the meal over here.</s> <s>And yet it is a pity; for the broth that Ailwin is making will be very good."</s> </p>

<p pid="488" id="settlers.c0.p488"><s>"I'll come over," said Roger.</s> <s>"I am stronger than you, and I can help you to feed the cow, and everything."</s> </p>

<p pid="489" id="settlers.c0.p489"><s>"I can do all that, with Ailwin to help: and I am sure Mildred had much rather you should stay here, unless you behave differently.</s> <s>And poor little George, too!</s> <s>He is not well, and we do not like that he should be frightened."</s> </p>

<p pid="490" id="settlers.c0.p490"><s>"I sha'n't frighten him or anybody, you'll see.</s> <s>You had better let me come; and Spy and I will bring you a lot of game."</s> </p>

<p pid="491" id="settlers.c0.p491"><s>"We don't want any game, at present.</s> <s>We have plenty to eat."</s> </p>

<p pid="503" id="settlers.c0.p503"><s>When the boys at length appeared, to say how hungry they were, they burst in more like two schoolfellows who have been trying a new game, than little lads on whom others were depending for subsistence in the midst of a heavy calamity.</s> <s>They had made a raft--a real stout, broad raft, which would be of more use to them (now the currents were slackening) than anything they had attempted yet.</s> <s>Oliver told that among the many things which the current brought from poor neighbour Gool's, was a lot of harness from his stables.</s> <s>Roger had seen at once what strong fastenings this harness would make for their raft.</s> <s>They had then crossed to their own stable, and found their own suit of harness hanging safe against the wall which remained.</s> <s>They had tied their planks to three stout beams, which they had pulled out from the ruined part of their house wall.</s> <s>It had been pretty hard work; but the raft was secure, and well fastened, moreover, to a door-post, with a long line; so that they might row about without having always to be looking that they were not carried abroad into the carr.</s> <s>Oliver really thought it was almost as good as having a boat.</s> <s>Roger protested that it was better, because it would hold more goods: but the brother and sister could not think that the raft was the best of the two, when they remembered that a boat would carry them, perhaps, to their mother's arms.</s> <s>Oliver knew what Mildred was thinking of when he said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="506" id="settlers.c0.p506"><s>Roger was quite in spirits and good humour.</s> <s>It may seem strange that a boy who was so lazy the day before, as to wish that hares ran about ready roasted, should work so hard this day at so severe a job as making a raft.</s> <s>But it was natural enough.</s> <s>There is nothing interesting to a dull and discontented person, all alone, in preparing a meal for his own self to eat: but there is something animating in planning a clever job, which can be set about immediately--a ready and willing companion being at hand to help, and to talk with.</s> <s>There was also something immediate to be gained by finishing this raft.</s> <s>One thing or another was floating by every quarter of an hour, which it would be worth while to seize and bring home.</s> <s>As Roger saw, now a hay-cock, and now a man's hat, float by, he worked harder and harder, that as few treasures as possible might be thus lost.</s> <s>Oliver felt much in the same way, particularly from his want of a hat or cap.</s> <s>Ailwin had made him tie a handkerchief round his head; but it heated him, without saving him much from the scorching of the sun on his head, and the glare from the waters to his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="507" id="settlers.c0.p507"><s>Ailwin had looked for some compliments to her cookery from the hungry boys; but they forgot, in their eagerness about the raft, that it was a treat in these days to have meal-cakes; and they ate and talked, without thinking much of what it was that they were putting into their mouths.</s> <s>When they went off again to see what they could find, it is not to be told how Mildred would have liked to go with them.</s> <s>She did not want her dinner, to which Ailwin said they two would now sit down comfortably.</s> <s>She did not now mind the precipice and the broken walls, and the staring rafters.</s> <s>She longed to stand somewhere, and see the boys take prizes in the stream.</s> <s>She had held poor George all the morning; for he would not let her put him on the bed.</s> <s>Her back ached, her arms were stiff, and her very heart was sick with his crying.</s> <s>He had been fretting or wailing ever since daylight; and Mildred felt as if she could not bear it one minute longer.</s> <s>Just then she heard a laugh from the boys outside; and Ailwin began to sing, as she always did when putting away the pots and pans.</s> <s>Nobody seemed to care: nobody seemed to think of her; and Mildred remembered how different it would have been if her mother had been there.</s> <s>Her mother would have been thinking about poor George all the morning: but her mother would have thought of her too; would have remembered that she must be tired; and have cheered her with talk, or with saying something hopeful about the poor baby.</s> </p>

<p pid="514" id="settlers.c0.p514" type="speech"><s>"They had the planks ready to their hands," said Mildred, trembling; <qs/>"and leather harness and ropes to tie it with.</s> <s>I think they might to do it as they said.</s> <s>What harm do you suppose will happen, Ailwin?</s> <s>I am sure Oliver would do nothing wrong, about making the raft, or anything else.--O dear!</s> <s>I wish George would not cry so!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="518" id="settlers.c0.p518"><s>Mildred went at once to the top of the staircase, which stood up firm, though the building had fallen away on almost every side of it.</s> <s>It was rather a giddy affair at first, sitting on the top stair of a spiral staircase of which part of the walls were gone, while the bare rafters of the roof let the water be seen through them.</s> <s>Mildred soon grew accustomed to her place, however, and fixed her eyes on the raft with which the boys were plying in the stream.</s> <s>She supposed they had caught a hay-cock; for the cow was eating, very industriously,--no longer on the dunghill, but on a slip of ground which had been left dry between it and the stable.</s> <s>The cow had company to share her good cheer: whether invited or uninvited, there was no saying.</s> <s>A strange pony was there; and a sheep, and a well-grown calf.</s> <s>These animals all pressed upon one another on the narrow space of ground, thrusting their heads over or under one another's necks, to snatch the hay.</s> </p>

<p pid="519" id="settlers.c0.p519" type="speech"><s>"How hungry they are!" thought Mildred, <qs/>"and how they tease one another!"<qe/></s> <s>She then remembered having read of men starving in a boat at sea, who became as selfish as these animals in snatching from one another their last remaining morsels of food.</s> <s>She hoped that she and Oliver should not be starved, at last, in the middle of this flood: but if they were, she did not believe that Oliver and she could ever snatch food from each other, or help themselves before Geordie, whatever Roger might do, or even Ailwin.</s> <s>Ailwin was very kind and good-tempered; but then she was apt to be so very hungry!</s> <s>However, there was no occasion to think of want of food yet.</s> <s>The meal which had been wetted, round the sides and under the lid of the chest, served well to feed the fowls; and they seemed to find something worth picking up in the mud and slime that the waters had left behind as they sank.</s> <s>The poor sow had farrowed too.</s> <s>She and her little pigs were found almost dead with hunger and wet: but the meal-chest had come just in time to save them.</s> <s>Ailwin had said it was worth while to spare them some of the meal; for the little pigs, if their mother was well fed, would give them many a good dinner.</s> <s>There was no occasion to fear want of food at present.</s> </p>

<p pid="520" id="settlers.c0.p520"><s>The boys were on their raft in the middle of the stream, working away with their broad paddles, evidently wishing to catch something which was floating down.</s> <s>Mildred could see only a small tree bobbing about, sometimes showing its roots above water, and sometimes its leafy branches.</s> <s>What could they want with a young tree, so well off as they were for drier fire-wood than it would make?</s> <s>They were determined to have it, it was clear; for Roger threw down his paddle as they neared the tree, caught up a long rope, and gave it a cast towards the branching top as the rope went through the air, Mildred saw that it had a noose at the end.</s> <s>The noose caught:--the tree gave a topple in the water, when it found itself stopped in its course with a jerk; and the boys set up a shout as they pulled for the house, hauling in their prize after them.</s> </p>

<p pid="521" id="settlers.c0.p521"><s>Mildred ran down the stairs as far as she dared,--almost to the very brink of the water.</s> <s>There she was near enough to see and hear what was doing.</s> <s>The tree was an apple-tree; and though the ripest apples were gone, a good many were left, which would be a treat when cooked.</s> <s>The boys saw her watching them, and Roger said it was not fair that she should stand idle while they were working like horses:--why should not she gather the apples before they were all knocked off, instead of keeping other people out of the stream to do such girls' work?</s> <s>Oliver said she had been as useful as anybody all day; and she should do as she liked now.</s> <s>He called out to Mildred; and asked her whether she should like to gather the apples off the tree, while they went to see what else they could find.</s> <s>Mildred replied that she should like it very much, if they could bring in the tree to the place where she was.</s> <s>Ailwin would find something for her to put the apples in.</s> </p>

<p pid="522" id="settlers.c0.p522"><s>Neither the raft nor the tree, however, could be got through the breach in the wall.</s> <s>Oliver fetched the tub, which had been discarded since the raft had been thought of.</s> <s>He rowed himself to the staircase in this tub, and asked Mildred if she was afraid just to cross those few yards to the wall.</s> <s>He would find her a nice seat on the wall, where she could sit plucking the apples, and seeing all they did on the raft.</s> <s>He would be sure to come, for her, as soon as she should make a signal for him.</s> <s>Meantime, the tub would hold the apples.</s> </p>

<p pid="523" id="settlers.c0.p523"><s>Mildred had a great fancy for sharing the boys' adventures; and though the tub looked a small, unsteady boat, she ventured to slide down into it, and sit in it, while her brother rowed her over to the broken wall.</s> <s>She was so silent that Oliver thought she was frightened; but she was considering whether or not to tell him of Ailwin's fears of his being on the raft with Roger.</s> <s>Before she had decided, they had come within hearing of Roger, and it was too late.</s> </p>

<p pid="524" id="settlers.c0.p524"><s>After finding a steady broad stone in the wall for her to sit on, Oliver chose to stay a little while, to cut and break off from the trunk the branches that had the most fruit on them.</s> <s>This would make Mildred's work much easier.</s> <s>Oliver also chose, in spite of all Roger could say, to leave her one of their paddles.</s> <s>He considered (though he did not say it) that some accident might possibly happen to the raft, to prevent their returning for her: and he declared that Mildred should have an oar to row herself in with, if she should have a mind to join Ailwin, at any moment, instead of waiting where she was.</s> <s>So having moored the tub inside the house wall, and the apple-tree outside, and established Mildred on a good seat between, the boys pushed off again.</s> </p>

<p pid="525" id="settlers.c0.p525"><s>Mildred found that she had undertaken a wet and dirty task.</s> <s>The branches of the apple-tree were dripping, and the fruit covered with slime; but these are things which must not be minded in times of flood.</s> <s>So she went on, often looking away, however, to wonder what things were which were swept past her, and to watch the proceedings of the boys.</s> <s>After a while, she became so bold as to consider what a curious thing it would be if she, without any raft, should pick up some article as valuable as any that had swum the stream.</s> <s>This thought was put into her head by seeing something occasionally flap out upon the surface of the muddy water, as if it were spread out below.</s> <s>It looked to her like the tail of a coat, or the skirt of a petticoat.</s> <s>She was just about to fish it up with her paddle, when it occurred to her that it might be the clothing of a drowned person.</s> <s>She shrank back at the thought, and in the first terror of having a dead body so near her, called Oliver's name.</s> <s>He did not hear; and she would not repeat the call when she saw how busy he was.</s> <s>She tried not to think of this piece of cloth; but it came up perpetually before her eyes, flap, flapping, till she felt that it would be best to satisfy herself at once, as to what it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="526" id="settlers.c0.p526"><s>She poked her paddle underneath the flap, and found that it was caught and held down by something heavy.</s> <s>She tugged hard at it, and raised some more blue cloth.</s> <s>She did not believe there was a body now; and she laid hold of the cloth and drew it in.</s> <s>It was heavy in itself, and made more so by the wet, so that the little girl had to set her foot against a stone in the wall, and employ all her strength, before she could land the cloth, yard after yard, upon the wall.</s> <s>It was a piece of home-spun, probably laid out on the grass of some field in the Levels, after dyeing, and so carried away.</s> <s>When Mildred had pulled in a vast quantity, there was some resistance;--the rest would not come.</s> <s>Perhaps something heavy had lodged upon it, and kept it down.</s> <s>Again she used her paddle, setting her feet against one stone, and pressing her back against another, to give her more power.</s> <s>In the midst of the effort, the stone behind her gave way.</s> <s>It was her paddle now, resting against some support under water, which saved her from popping into the water with the great stone.</s> <s>As it was, she swayed upon her seat, and was very nearly gone, while the heavy stone slid in, and raised a splash which wetted her from head to foot, and left her trembling in every limb.</s> <s>She had fancied, once or twice before, that the wall shook under her: she was now persuaded that it was all shaking, and would soon be carried quite away.</s> <s>She screamed out to Oliver to come and save her.</s> <s>She must have called very loud; for Ailwin, with George in her arms, was out on the staircase in a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="527" id="settlers.c0.p527"><s>There was a scuffle on the raft.</s> <s>It seemed as if Oliver was paddling with one hand, and keeping off Roger with the other.</s> <s>It was terrible to see them,--it was so like fighting, in a most dangerous place.</s> <s>There was a splash.</s> <s>Mildred's eyes grew dim in a moment, and she could see nothing: but she heard Ailwin's voice,--very joyful,--calling out to Oliver,--</s> </p>

<p pid="533" id="settlers.c0.p533"><s>Down went all the gathered apples into the water, within the wall, and off went the tub outside.</s> <s>Oliver fastened the line round a heavy stone in the wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="566" id="settlers.c0.p566"><s>Roger answered only by fresh kicks and struggles.</s> <s>Ailwin said aloud that she saw nothing for it but leaving him on this spit of land, to starve on the dunghill.</s> <s>There would be no taking him over to the house in this temper.</s> <s>Roger vowed he would drown all the little pigs, and hough the cow.</s> <s>He had done such a thing before; and he would do it again; so that they should not have a drop more milk for George.</s> </p>

<p pid="576" id="settlers.c0.p576"><s>It was now Roger's mood to lie like one dead.</s> <s>He did not move a muscle when he was lifted, and laid on the raft.</s> <s>Ailwin was so delighted to see the boy she was so afraid of thus humbled, that she could not help giving his face a splash and rub with the muddy water of the stream as he lay.</s> </p>

<p pid="582" id="settlers.c0.p582"><s>Roger would not appear to hear: so his companions made short work of it.</s> <s>They pulled in for the shore of the Red-hill, and laid Roger on the slimy bank:--for they saw no occasion to carry one so heavy and so sulky up to the nice bed of grass which was spread at the top of the red precipice that the waters had cut Oliver knew that there was a knife in Roger's pocket.</s> <s>He took it out, cut the cord which tied his wrists, and threw the knife to a little distance, where Roger could easily reach it in order to free his legs; but not in time to overtake them before they should have put off again.</s> </p>

<p pid="611" id="settlers.c0.p611"><s>While he was gone, Mildred asked Ailwin whether she was very tired.</s> </p>

<p pid="613" id="settlers.c0.p613"><s>"Then do not you think you and I could fetch off a good many things, while he watches Geordie on the grass?</s> <s>If you thought you could row the raft, I am sure I could carry a great many things down-stairs, and land them on the hill."</s> </p>

<p pid="614" id="settlers.c0.p614"><s>Ailwin had no doubt she could row, in such a narrow and gentle stream as now ran through the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="615" id="settlers.c0.p615"><s>She made the trial first when Oliver was on board, and several other times with Mildred, succeeding always very well.</s> <s>Oliver was extremely glad of this; for the bridge-basket had been used so much, and sometimes for such heavy weights, that it was wearing out, and might break down at any moment.</s> <s>The bridge-rope, too, being the stoutest cord they had, was very useful for tying the raft to the trunk of the beech, so that it could not be carried away.</s> <s>When once this rope was well fastened, Oliver was content to rest himself on the grass beside Geordie, and let the strong Ailwin and little Mildred work as they wished.</s> <s>It surprised him, well as he knew Ailwin, to see the loads she could carry, bringing a good-sized mattress up the bank as easily as he could have carried a pillow.</s> <s>She wrung the wet out of the long piece of home-spun, and spread it out in the sun, to dry as much as it could before dark, and seemed to think no more of it than Mildred did of washing her doll's petticoat.</s> </p>

<p pid="616" id="settlers.c0.p616"><s>Mildred took charge of the lighter articles that required care--her mother's china, for one thing; for it was found that nothing made of earthenware remained unbroken in the lower rooms.</s> <s>There were some pewter plates, which were now lodged under the beech, together with pots and pans, knives and forks, and horn spoons.</s> <s>There was no table light enough to be moved, but a small one of deal, which Ailwin dragged out from under water, with all its legs broken: but enough of it remained entire to make it preferable to the bare ground for preparing their food on, when once it should be dry.</s> <s>There was a stool a-piece--not forgetting one for Roger; and Mildred took care that Geordie should have his own little chair.</s> <s>Not even Ailwin could carry a chest of drawers: but she carried down the separate drawers, with the clothes of the family in them.</s> <s>No one of the household had ever seen a carpet; but there was matting on some of the floors.</s> <s>Ailwin pulled up pieces of this, to be some protection against the damp and insects of the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="617" id="settlers.c0.p617" type="speech"><s>"It is as wet as water now," said she; <qs/>"but we must not quarrel with anything to-day on that account; and matting will dry on the hill better than at home.</s> <s>If it turns out rotten, we must try and spare a piece of the cloth from overhead, to lay underfoot: but George will feel it more like home, if he has a bit of matting to trip his little foot against."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="660" id="settlers.c0.p660"><s>Roger did not want to hear anything more of this kind; so he went to where George was lying, and began to whistle softly to him.</s> <s>The child was so altered that his own mother would hardly have known him: but he smiled when he heard the whistle; and the smile was his own.</s> <s>He put up his hand and patted Roger's face, and even pulled his hair with a good stout pull.</s> <s>Roger had been used to nurse his dog, though not little children.</s> <s>He now took George into his arms, and laid him comfortably across his knees, while he whistled till the little fellow looked full in his face, and puckered up his poor white lips, as if he would whistle too.</s> <s>This made Roger laugh aloud; and then George laughed.</s> <s>Ailwin heard them, and peeped into the corner of the tent where they were.</s> <s>She flew to Oliver, to tell him that Roger was at his tricks worse than ever,--he was bewitching the baby.</s> <s>She was angry at Oliver for telling his sister, when he had looked in too, that they might have been very glad any of them, to bewitch poor baby in this manner, when he was crying so sadly all yesterday.</s> <s>Mildred, for her part, ran to thank Roger, and say how glad she should be to be able to whistle as he could.</s> </p>

<p pid="686" id="settlers.c0.p686"><s>None of these would open the chest.</s> <s>The party managed it at last by heating a large nail, which they drew out from a shattered door-post, and burning holes in the wood of the chest, close by the nails which fastened the hinges, so as to loosen them, and make them drop out.</s> <s>The lid being raised, a great variety of articles was found within, so nicely packed that the wet had penetrated but a very little way.</s> <s>Mildred had looked on thoughtfully; and she saw that Oliver paused when the contents lay open to view.</s> <s>She looked in her brother's face, and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="692" id="settlers.c0.p692"><s>"Nonsense, Mildred!" exclaimed Ailwin.</s> <s>"Who gave you the harness that braces the raft, or the meal you have been living on these two days, I wonder: and how do you know but somebody is hungry, and longing for it, at this minute?"</s> </p>

<p pid="694" id="settlers.c0.p694"><s>"Nor I: but I think we were right enough there.</s> <s>The meal would all have been spoiled presently; and meal (and the harness too) is a sort of thing that we can pay for, or make up for in some way, if ever we can meet with the people who lost that chest."</s> </p>

<p pid="713" id="settlers.c0.p713"><s>Roger was not long in finding a hole in a tree where he could hide his bag of money.</s> <s>He cut a small cross in the bark by which he might know the tree again, and hastened back, to see what else he could secure.</s> <s>He found plenty of pretty things hanging on the bushes, and did not wait for their being quite dry to dress himself as he had never been dressed before.</s> <s>With the embroidered cap above mentioned on his head, a scarlet waistcoat, worked with silver thread, hanging loose about his body, and a light blue coat, whose skirts reached his heels, he looked so little like the dirty ragged Roger, that Geordie shrank back from him, at first sight, and did not smile till he heard the soft whistle again.</s> <s>After that, he seemed more pleased with the finery than all the rest of the party together.</s> <s>Ailwin glanced scornfully upon it, as if she had disapproved from the beginning its being touched; and Oliver and Mildred looked grave.</s> </p>

<p pid="714" id="settlers.c0.p714"><s>So very much pleased was Geordie with the gay waistcoat, that Roger took him into his arms, that he might be able to stroke it, and play with the silver flowers.</s> <s>It was little fatigue, now, except to the spirits, to nurse poor George.</s> <s>He was shrunk to skin and bone, and so light as to startle those who had been accustomed to lift him.</s> <s>It was grievous, however, to look at the ghastly stretched features, the flabby tremulous little arms, and the suffering expression of countenance.</s> <s>To hear his feeble cry was worse still.</s> <s>Oliver was really glad to take Mildred away from seeing and hearing him, as long as the child would be quiet with Roger: so he asked her to filter more water through the gravel.</s> <s>He begged her to get ready a great deal--enough for them all to drink, and to bathe George in; for the water about them was becoming of a worse quality every day.</s> <s>It was unsafe even to live near; and much more to drink.</s> <s>So he scraped up a quantity of clean dry gravel from the ledges of the precipice where the first flood had thrown it, and helped Mildred to press this gravel down in the worn old basket.</s> <s>This basket they set across the tub, which they first thoroughly cleaned.</s> <s>Mildred poured water upon the gravel by degrees; and it was astonishing how much purer and better it came out of the tub than it went into the basket.</s> <s>When the tub was full, Ailwin heated some of the water presently over her large fire, and made a warm bath for the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="715" id="settlers.c0.p715"><s>Roger was unwilling to give him up when the bath was ready, so new and so pleasant did he find it to be liked and loved by anybody--to have power over any one, so much more easy and delightful to exercise than that of force.</s> <s>But, not only was the bath ready, and must not be left to cool, but Oliver beckoned him away on some very particular business.</s> </p>

<p pid="716" id="settlers.c0.p716"><s>This business was indeed pressing.</s> <s>All the party had complained that the bad smells about the Red-hill became really oppressive.</s> <s>They did not know how great was the danger of their all falling ill of fever, in consequence; but every one of them felt languid and uncomfortable.</s> <s>Oliver made the circuit of the hill, to discover whether there was any cause for this evil that could be removed.</s> <s>He was surprised to find the number of dead animals that were lying about in holes and corners, as well as the heap of Roger's game, now actually putrefying in the sun.</s> <s>There was also a dead horse thrown up, on the side where the quarry was; and about this horse were such swarms of flies as Oliver had never seen.</s> <s>It was to consult about pushing back this horse into the stream, and clearing away all other dead things that they could find, that Oliver now called Roger.</s> </p>

<p pid="717" id="settlers.c0.p717"><s>Roger was struck with what he observed.</s> <s>He saw no difficulty in clearing away the game he ought never to have left lying in a heap in the sun.</s> <s>He believed, too, that with stout poles he and Oliver could shove the horse into the water; and, with a line tied to its head, tow it out of the still water into the current which yet ran from the quarry.</s> <s>But what troubled him more was, that there was evidently a mortality among the animals on the hill.</s> <s>They were dying in all directions; some for want of proper food, and from being put out of their usual habits: others from being preyed upon by their stronger neighbours.</s> <s>Nothing seemed to thrive but the ravenous birds which came in clusters, winging their way over the waters, and making a great rustling of their pinions as they descended to perch upon some dead animal, pulling it to pieces before the very eyes of the boys, as they stood consulting what to do.</s> <s>It was a horrid sight: and it brought the horrid thought that soon probably there would be no game left for food for the party; and that what there was meantime might be unwholesome.</s> <s>Oliver had never imagined that the bold boy, Roger Redfurn, could look so alarmed as he did at this moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="724" id="settlers.c0.p724"><s>While the boys were hard at work at their disagreeable task, Mildred was enjoying seeing George in his warm bath.</s> <s>Ailwin held him there, while Mildred continued her useful business of filtering water, talking to the child all the while.</s> <s>The poor little fellow soon left off crying, and moved his weak limbs about in the tepid water, trying to splash Ailwin, as he had been wont to splash his mother in play, every morning when she washed and dressed him.</s> </p>

<p pid="725" id="settlers.c0.p725"><s>"I am sure it does him a great deal of good," exclaimed Mildred.</s> <s>"I will filter quantities of water; and he shall have a bath as often as ever it is good for him.</s> <s>Suppose it should make him well!"</s> </p>

<p pid="726" id="settlers.c0.p726"><s>Ailwin shook her head.</s> <s>She saw how impossible it would be even to keep a healthy child well in the absence of proper food, in an unwholesome atmosphere, and without sufficient shelter from the changes of weather which might come at any hour, and must come soon.</s> <s>How unlikely it was that a sick baby should recover under such circumstances, she was well aware.</s> <s>Yet she little thought how near the end was.</s> </p>

<p pid="727" id="settlers.c0.p727"><s>After his bath, Geordie lay, nicely covered up, on a mattress under the tent.</s> <s>One or other of his nurses visited, him every few minutes; and both were satisfied that he was comfortably asleep.</s> <s>The boys came for some dinner, at last; and while Oliver went to wash his hands in clean water, Roger stooped over the child to kiss him.</s> <s>Before doing so, however, he started back, and asked Ailwin why the baby's eyes looked so strangely.</s> <s>They were half closed, and seemed like neither sleep nor waking.</s> <s>Ailwin sat down on the mattress, and took him into her arms, while Mildred ran to call Oliver.</s> <s>The poor child stretched himself stiff across Ailwin's knees, and then breathed no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="729" id="settlers.c0.p729"><s>"Whistle to him, Roger!" exclaimed Mildred, through her trembling.</s> <s>"Try if he cannot hear that.</s> <s>Whistle to him softly."</s> </p>

<p pid="733" id="settlers.c0.p733"><s>Roger threw himself on the grass, and hid his face on his arms.</s> <s>He moaned and rocked himself about, so that, even in the first moments of their grief, the brother and sister looked at each other with awe.</s> </p>

<p pid="737" id="settlers.c0.p737"><s>Oliver and Mildred walked on till they could descend the bank a little, and sit, just above the waters, where they knew they were out of sight of everybody.</s> <s>This bank presented a strange appearance, such as the children had been wondering at for some days, till Ailwin remembered that she had often heard say that there was once a thick forest growing where the Levels were now spread, and that the old trees were, every one, somehow underground.</s> <s>It now appeared that this was true.</s> <s>As the earth was washed away in the channel, and cut down along the bank, large trunks of trees were seen lying along, black as coal.</s> <s>Some others started out of the bank; and the roots of a few spread like network, holding the soil together, and keeping the bank firm in that part.</s> <s>Upon one of the trunks, that jutted out, Oliver took his seat; and Mildred placed herself beside him.</s> </p>

<p pid="792" id="settlers.c0.p792"><s>"And what were you to do, if you found anything more?" asked Ailwin.</s> <s>"One might easily bury some of the ware my uncle brings, and keep it in the moss till it is well wetted; and then some earl might give one gold for it.</s> <s>Come, Roger, tell me what you were to do with your findings.</s> <s>You owe it to me to tell me; considering that your people have got away my cloak and warm stockings."</s> </p>

<p pid="793" id="settlers.c0.p793"><s>"Look for them in the moss,--you had better," said Roger.</s> <s>"You will find them there or nowhere."</s> </p>

<p pid="794" id="settlers.c0.p794"><s>Not a word more would he say of his own concerns.</s> </p>

<p pid="795" id="settlers.c0.p795"><s>Oliver did not want to hear more.</s> <s>On being told of the Earl of Arundel's statues and vases, he had, for a moment, longed to see them, and wondered whether there were any alabaster cups in the collection; but his thoughts were presently with George again.</s> <s>He remembered that Mildred had been left long enough alone with the body; and he dismissed Ailwin, saying that he himself should soon have done, it was now growing so dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="796" id="settlers.c0.p796"><s>As he worked on silently and thoughtfully, Roger supposed he was observing nothing; and therefore ventured, turning his back on Oliver, to investigate a little more closely the leathern curiosity he had met with.</s> <s>He disengaged the earth more and more, drew something out, and started at what he saw.</s> </p>

<p pid="797" id="settlers.c0.p797"><s>"You _have_ found a curiosity," observed Oliver, quietly.</s> <s>"That is a mummy."</s> </p>

<p pid="798" id="settlers.c0.p798"><s>"No--'tis a man," exclaimed Roger, in some agitation.</s> <s>"At least it is something like a man.</s> <s>Is not this like an arm, with a hand at the end of it?--a little dried, shrunk, ugly arm.</s> <s>'Tis not stiff, neither.</s> <s>Look!</s> <s>It can't be Uncle Stephen, sure--or Nan!"</s> </p>

<p pid="799" id="settlers.c0.p799"><s>"No, no: it is a mummy--a human body which has been buried for hundreds and thousands of years."</s> </p>

<p pid="800" id="settlers.c0.p800"><s>Roger had never heard of a mummy; and there was no great wonder in that, when even Oliver did not rightly know the meaning of the word.</s> <s>All animal bodies (and not only human bodies) which remain dry, by any means, instead of putrefying, are called mummies.</s> </p>

<p pid="801" id="settlers.c0.p801"><s>"What do you mean by hundreds and thousands of years?" said Roger.</s> <s>"Look here, how the arm bends, and the wrist!</s> <s>I believe I could make its fingers close on mine," he continued, stepping back--evidently afraid of the remains which lay before him.</s> <s>"If I was sure now, that it was not Stephen or Nan ...

<p pid="802" id="settlers.c0.p802"><s>"So it does.</s> <s>It preserves bodies, as I told you.</s> <s>I will show you in a minute that it is nobody you have ever known."</s> </p>

<p pid="803" id="settlers.c0.p803"><s>And Oliver took from Roger's hand the slip of wood with which he had been working, and began to clear out more soil about the figure.</s> </p>

<p pid="804" id="settlers.c0.p804"><s>"Don't, don't now!" exclaimed Roger.</s> <s>"Don't uncover the face!</s> <s>If you do, I will go away."</s> </p>

<p pid="805" id="settlers.c0.p805"><s>"Go, then," replied Oliver.</s> <s>It appeared as if the bold boy and the timid one had changed characters.</s> <s>The reason was that Roger had some very disagreeable thoughts connected with Stephen and Nan Redfurn.</s> <s>He never forgot, when their images were before him, that they had died in the midst of angry and contemptuous feelings between them and him.</s> <s>Oliver, on the other hand, was religious.</s> <s>Though, in easy times, more afraid than he ought to have been of dishonest and violent persons, he had yet enough trust in God to support his spirits and his hope in trial, as we have seen: and about death and the grave, and the other world, where he believed the dead went to meet their Maker and Father, he had no fear at all.</s> <s>Nothing that Roger now said, therefore, made him desist, till he had uncovered half the dried body.</s> </p>

<p pid="806" id="settlers.c0.p806" type="speech"><s>"Look here!" said he--for Roger had not gone away as he had threatened--<qs/>"come closer and look, or you will see nothing in the dusk.</s> <s>Did either Stephen or Nan wear their hair this way?</s> <s>And is this dress anything like Ailwin's cloak?</s> <s>Look at the long black hair hanging all round the little flat brown face.</s> <s>And the dress: it is the skin of some beast, with the hair left on--a rough-edged skin, fastened with a bit of something like coal on the left shoulder.</s> <s>I dare say it was once a wooden skewer.</s> <s>I wonder how long ago this body was alive.</s> <s>I wonder what sort of a country this was to live in, at that day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="807" id="settlers.c0.p807"><s>Roger's fear having now departed, his more habitual feelings again prevailed.</s> </p>

<p pid="808" id="settlers.c0.p808" type="speech"><s>"I say," said he, returning to the spot, and wrenching the tool from Oliver's hand; <qs/>"I say--don't you meddle any more.</s> <s>The curiosity is mine, you know.</s> <s>I found it, and it's mine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="809" id="settlers.c0.p809"><s>"What will you do with it?" asked Oliver, who saw that, even now, Roger rather shrank from touching the limbs, and turned away from the open eyes of the body.</s> </p>

<p pid="810" id="settlers.c0.p810"><s>"It will make a show.</s> <s>If I don't happen to see the earl, so as to get gold for it, I'll make people give me a penny a piece to see it; and that will be as good as gold presently."</s> </p>

<p pid="811" id="settlers.c0.p811"><s>"I wish you would bury it," earnestly exclaimed Oliver, as the thought occurred to him that the time might come, though perhaps hundreds of years hence, when dear little George's body might be found in like manner.</s> <s>He could not endure the idea of that body being ever made a show of.</s> </p>

<p pid="812" id="settlers.c0.p812"><s>Of course, Roger would not hear of giving up his treasure; and Oliver was walking away, when Roger called after him--</s> </p>

<p pid="813" id="settlers.c0.p813"><s>"Don't go yet, Oliver.</s> <s>Wait a minute, and I will come with you."</s> </p>

<p pid="814" id="settlers.c0.p814"><s>Oliver proceeded, however, thinking that Roger would have to acquire some courage yet before he could carry about his mummy for a show.</s> </p>

<p pid="815" id="settlers.c0.p815"><s>Oliver was only going for Mildred--to let her see, before it was quite dark, what had been done, and what found.</s> <s>When they returned, Roger was standing at some distance from the bank, apparently watching his mummy as it lay in the cleft that he had cleared.</s> <s>He started when he heard Mildred's gentle voice exclaiming at its being so small and so dark-coloured.</s> <s>She next wondered how old it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="816" id="settlers.c0.p816"><s>After the boys had examined the ground again, and put together all they had heard about the ancient condition of the Levels, they agreed that this person must have been buried, or have died alone in the woods, before the district became a marsh.</s> <s>Pastor Dendel had told Oliver about the thick forest that covered these lands when the Romans invaded Britain; and how the inhabitants fled to the woods, and so hid themselves there that the Roman soldiers had to cut down the woods to get at them; and how the trees, falling across the courses of the streams, dammed them up, so that the surrounding soil was turned into a swamp; and how mosses and water-plants grew over the fallen trees, and became matted together, so that more vegetation grew on the top of that, till the ancient forest was, at length, quite buried in the carr.</s> <s>Oliver now reminded his sister of all this: and they looked with a kind of veneration on the form which they supposed was probably that of an ancient Briton, who, flying from the invaders, into the recesses of the forest, had perished there alone.</s> <s>There was no appearance of his having been buried.</s> <s>No earthen vessels, or other remains, such as were usually found in the graves of the ancients, appeared to be contained in the bank.</s> <s>If he had died lying along the ground, his body would have decayed like other bodies, or been devoured by wild beasts.</s> <s>Perhaps he was drowned in one of the ponds or streams of the forest, and the body, being immediately washed over with sand or mud, was thus preserved.</s> </p>

<p pid="817" id="settlers.c0.p817"><s>"What is the use of guessing and guessing?" exclaimed Roger.</s> <s>"If people should dig up George's bones, out of this bank, a thousand years hence, and find them lying in a sort of oven, as they would call it, with a fine carved stone for one of the six sides, do you think they could ever guess how all these things came to be here?"</s> </p>

<p pid="818" id="settlers.c0.p818"><s>"This way of burying is an accident, such as no one would think of guessing," said Oliver, sighing.</s> <s>"And this dried body may be here, to be sure, by some other accident that we know nothing about.</s> <s>I really wish, Roger, you would cover up the corpse again; at least, till we know whether we shall all die together here."</s> </p>

<p pid="819" id="settlers.c0.p819"><s>This was what Roger could never bear to hear of.</s> <s>He always ran away from it: and so he did now.</s> <s>Dark as it was growing, he passed over to the house, and mounted the staircase (which stood as firm as ever, and looked something like a self-supported ladder).</s> <s>While he was vainly looking abroad for boats, which the shadows of the evening would have prevented his seeing if they had been there by hundreds, the brother and sister speculated on one thing more, in connection with the spectacle which had powerfully excited their imaginations.</s> <s>Mildred whispered to Oliver--</s> </p>

<p pid="820" id="settlers.c0.p820"><s>"If this old man and George lie together here, I wonder whether their spirits will know it, and come together in heaven."</s> </p>

<p pid="821" id="settlers.c0.p821"><s>They talked for some time about the difference there must be between the thoughts of an ancient Briton, skin-clothed, a hunter of the wolf, and living on the acorns and wild animals of the forest, and the mind of a little child, reared in the Levels, and nourished and amused between the farm-yard and the garden.</s> <s>Yet they agreed that there must have been some things in which two so different thought and felt alike.</s> <s>The sky was over the heads of both, and the air around them, and the grass spread under their feet:--both, too, had, no doubt, had relations, by whom they had been beloved: and there is no saying how many things may become known alike to all, on entering upon the life after death.</s> <s>Oliver and Mildred resolved that if ever they should see Pastor Dendel again, they would ask him what he thought of all this.</s> <s>They agreed that they would offer to help Roger to seek for other curiosities, to make a show of; and would give him, for his own, all they could find, if he would but consent to bury this body again, decently, and beside little George.</s> </p>

<p pid="822" id="settlers.c0.p822"><s>The supper was eatable to-night; and so was the breakfast on the Sunday morning; and yet Roger scarcely touched anything.</s> <s>Oliver heard him tossing and muttering during the night, and was sure that he was ill. He was ill.  He would not allow that he was so, however; and dressed himself again in the fine clothes he had taken from the chest.</s> <s>It was plain, from his shaking hand and his heavy eye, that he was too weak, and his head aching too much for him to be able to do any work; therefore Ailwin helped Oliver to finish the grave.</s> </p>

<p pid="823" id="settlers.c0.p823"><s>Roger inquired how the work proceeded: and it appeared that he meant to attend the funeral, when he found that it was to be in the afternoon.</s> <s>His companions did not believe him able: and he himself doubted it in his heart, resolved as he was to refuse to believe himself very ill, as long as he could keep off the thought.</s> <s>He found an excuse, however, for lying on the grass while the others were engaged at the grave.</s> <s>Oliver hinted to him, very gently, that Mildred and he had rather see him dressed in the shabbiest clothes of his own, than following their little brother to his grave in fine things which they could not but consider stolen.</s> <s>Roger was, in reality, only ashamed; but he pretended to be angry; and made use of the pretence to stay behind.</s> <s>While he lay, ill and miserable, remembering that little George alone had seemed to love him, and that George was dead, he believed it impossible that any one should mourn the child as he did in his heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="824" id="settlers.c0.p824"><s>Oliver himself took something from the chest--carefully and reverently; and carefully and reverently he put it back before night.</s> <s>There was a Bible, in Dutch; and with it a Prayer-book.</s> <s>He carried these, while Ailwin carried the body, wrapped in cloth, with another piece hanging over it, like a pall.</s> <s>As Oliver took Mildred's hand, and saw how pale and sorrowful she looked (though quite patient), he felt how much need they all had of the consolations and hopes which speak to mourners from the book he held.</s> </p>

<p pid="825" id="settlers.c0.p825"><s>Ailwin did not understand Dutch; so Oliver thought it kindest and best to say in English what he read, both from the Bible and Prayer-book.</s> <s>He read a short portion of what Saint Paul says about the dead and their rising again.</s> <s>Then all three assisted in closing the tomb, firmly and completely; and then they kneeled down, and Oliver read a prayer for mourners from his book.</s> <s>They did not sing; for he was not sure that Mildred could go through a hymn.</s> <s>He made a sign to her to stay when Ailwin went home; and they two sat down on the grass above the bank, and read together that part of the Scripture in which Jesus desires his followers not to let their hearts be troubled, but to believe in God and in him.</s> </p>

<p pid="826" id="settlers.c0.p826"><s>Mildred was soon quite happy; and Oliver was cheered to see her so.</s> <s>He even began, after a time, to talk of the future.</s> <s>He pointed out how the waters had sunk, leaving now, he supposed, only about three feet of depth, besides mud and slime.</s> <s>This mud would make the soil more fertile than it had ever been, if the remainder of the flood could by any means be drawn off.</s> <s>He thought his father might return, and drain his ground, and rebuild the house.</s> <s>Then the bank they sat on would overlook a more beautiful garden than they had ever yet possessed.</s> <s>The whole land had been so well _warped_ (that is, flooded with fertilising mud) that everything that was planted would flourish.</s> <s>They might get the finest tulip-roots from Holland, and have a bed of them; and another of choice auriculas, just below George's tomb; and honeysuckles might be trained round it, to attract the bees.</s> </p>

<p pid="827" id="settlers.c0.p827"><s>Mildred liked to hear all this; and she said so; but she added that she should like it better still to-morrow, perhaps.</s> <s>She felt so strangely tired now, that she could not listen any more, even to what she liked to hear.</s> </p>

<p pid="828" id="settlers.c0.p828"><s>"Are you going to be ill, do you think, dear?"</s> </p>

<p pid="829" id="settlers.c0.p829"><s>"I don't know.</s> <s>Don't you think Roger is ill?"</s> </p>

<p pid="830" id="settlers.c0.p830"><s>"Yes; and I dare say we shall all have the fever, from the damps and bad smells of this place."</s> </p>

<p pid="831" id="settlers.c0.p831"><s>"Well--never mind about me, Oliver.</s> <s>I am only very, very tired yet."</s> </p>

<p pid="832" id="settlers.c0.p832"><s>"Come home, and lie down, and I will sit beside you," said Oliver.</s> <s>"You will be patient, I know, dear.</s> <s>I will try if I can be patient, if I should see you very ill."</s> </p>

<p pid="833" id="settlers.c0.p833"><s>He led her home, and laid her down, and scarcely left her for many hours.</s> <s>It was plain now that the fever had seized upon them; and where it would stop, who could tell?</s> <s>During the night he and Ailwin watched by turns beside their sick companions.</s> <s>This would not have been necessary for Mildred; but Roger was sometimes a little delirious; and they were afraid of his frightening Mildred by his startings and strange sayings.</s> </p>

<p pid="834" id="settlers.c0.p834"><s>When Ailwin came, at dawn, to take Oliver's place, she patted him on the shoulder, and bade him go to sleep, and be in no hurry to rouse himself again; for he would not be wanted for anything if he should sleep till noon.</s> </p>

<p pid="835" id="settlers.c0.p835"><s>Oliver was tired enough; but there was one thing which he had a great mind to do before he slept.</s> <s>He wished to look out once again from the staircase, when the sun should have risen, to see whether there was no moving speck on the wide waters--no promise of help in what now threatened to be his extremity.</s> <s>Ailwin thought him perverse; but did not oppose his going when he said he was sure he should sleep better after it.</s> <s>She soon, therefore, saw his figure among the ruins of the roof, standing up between her and the brightening sky.</s> </p>

<p pid="836" id="settlers.c0.p836"><s>CHAPTER ELEVEN.</s> <s>MORE HARDSHIP.</s> </p>

<p pid="837" id="settlers.c0.p837"><s>This morning was unlike the mornings which Oliver had watched since the flood came.</s> <s>There was no glowing sky towards the east; and he saw that there would be no broad train of light over the waters, which should so dazzle his eyes as almost to prevent his seeing anything else.</s> <s>It was now a stormy-looking sunrise.</s> <s>Huge piles of clouds lay on the eastern horizon, through which it seemed impossible that the rays of the sun should pierce.</s> <s>The distant church-spire looked black amidst the grey flood: and the houses and chapel at Sandtoft, which now stood high out of the water, had a dark and dismal air.</s> <s>Oliver would have been rather glad to believe that there would be no sunshine this day, if he had not feared there would be storm.</s> <s>He had so learned, in these few days, to associate reeking fogs and putrid smells with hot sunshine, that a shady day would have been a relief: but it there should come a tempest, what could be done with the sick members of the party?</s> <s>It was dangerous to stand under the trees in a thunderstorm; and the poor tent would be soaked through with a quarter of an hour's rain.</s> <s>He thought it would be best to take down the tent, and wrap up Mildred and Roger in the cloth; and to pile the mattresses, one upon another, at the foot of the thickest tree they could find; so that there might be a chance of one bed being left dry for poor Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="838" id="settlers.c0.p838"><s>While arranging this in his mind, Oliver had been anxiously looking abroad for any moving speck on the grey waters.</s> <s>Seeing none, but perceiving that the clouds were slowly mounting the sky, and moving onwards, he felt that he ought to be going to the hill, to make such preparations as were possible before the first raindrops should fall.</s> <s>Slowly and sadly he turned away to do so, when, casting one more glance eastwards, he perceived something moving--a dark speck, leaving the ruined roof of a dwelling which stood about half-way between himself and the hamlet.</s> </p>

<p pid="839" id="settlers.c0.p839"><s>There could be no doubt that this speck was a boat; and as it came nearer, Oliver saw that it was--a large boat, but quite full.</s> <s>He could distinguish no figures in it, so heavy seemed the mass of people, or of goods, with which it was crowded.</s> <s>It came on and on, however; and Oliver's heart beat faster as it came.</s> <s>How he wished now that he had kept a flag flying from the spot on which he stood!</s> <s>How he wished he now had a signal to fix on this height!</s> <s>Though the boat-people were still too far off to distinguish figures, a signal might catch their eye.</s> <s>If he went to the Red-hill for a flag, the boat might be gone away before his return.</s> <s>Trembling with haste, he stripped off his shirt, and swung it in the air.</s> <s>He even mounted the top stone, which, surrounded by no wall, or other defence, hung over the waters below.</s> <s>Oliver would have said, half an hour before, that he could not have stood alone on this perilous point: now, he not only stood there, but waved his white signal with all his strength.</s> </p>

<p pid="840" id="settlers.c0.p840"><s>Did anybody notice it?</s> </p>

<p pid="841" id="settlers.c0.p841"><s>He once thought he saw what might have been an oar lifted in the air; but he was not sure.</s> <s>He was presently only too certain of something else--that the boat was moving away, not in the direction in which it had approached, but southwards.</s> <s>He tried, as long as he could, to disbelieve this; but there it went--away--away--and Oliver had to come down from his stone, put on his clothes again, and find how thirsty he was.</s> </p>

<p pid="842" id="settlers.c0.p842"><s>There was hope still, he felt--great hope: but he must keep it from Mildred, who was in no condition to bear the disappointment of such a hope.</s> <s>He doubted whether Ailwin could control her tongue and her countenance, while possessed of such news.</s> <s>It would be hard not to be able to tell any one of what so filled his thoughts; and he resolved to see first what state Roger was in.</s> </p>

<p pid="843" id="settlers.c0.p843"><s>When he reached the tent, Roger was not there.</s> <s>Ailwin could not tell where he was.</s> <s>He had staggered away, like a drunken person, she said-- he seemed so giddy; but she could not leave Mildred to see after him, though he had spoken to a lord; if indeed that could be true of a boy like him.</s> <s>Ailwin looked up at the clouds, every moment, as she spoke; and Mildred shivered, as if she missed the morning sunshine.</s> <s>Oliver saw that he must make ready for the storm, before he prepared for what might follow.</s> <s>He and Ailwin pulled down the long piece of cloth from its support, doubled it again and again, and put Mildred into the middle of it.</s> <s>Oliver longed to lay her under a leafy tree; but he dared not, on account of the lightning, which was already beginning to flash.</s> <s>He and Ailwin set up the deal table as a sort of penthouse over her; and then busied themselves, in her sight, in piling together everything else they had, to keep as many articles as possible from spoiling.</s> </p>

<p pid="844" id="settlers.c0.p844"><s>Oliver was just thinking that he might slip away to seek Roger, when he saw that Mildred was sobbing, under the heap of cloth they had laid upon her.</s> <s>In a moment he was by her side, saying--</s> </p>

<p pid="845" id="settlers.c0.p845"><s>"What is the matter, dear?</s> <s>Are you afraid of the storm?</s> <s>I never knew you afraid of thunder and lightning; but perhaps you may be now, because you are ill."</s> </p>

<p pid="846" id="settlers.c0.p846"><s>"No," sobbed Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="847" id="settlers.c0.p847" type="speech"><s>"I cannot help being glad of this storm," continued Oliver, <qs/>"though it is disagreeable, at the time, to people who have no house to go to.</s> <s>I hope it will clear the air, and freshen it; and that is the very thing we want, to make you better."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="848" id="settlers.c0.p848"><s>"It is not that, Oliver.</s> <s>I don't mind the storm at all."</s> </p>

<p pid="849" id="settlers.c0.p849"><s>"Then what makes you cry so, dear?</s> <s>Is it about Geordie?"</s> </p>

<p pid="850" id="settlers.c0.p850"><s>"Yes.</s> <s>Something about him that I don't think you know; something that I shall never bear to think of.</s> <s>It will make me miserable as long as I live.</s> <s>Do you know, I was tired of nursing him, and hearing him cry; and I gave it up--the only thing I could do for him!</s> <s>I asked Ailwin to take him.</s> <s>And in two days he was dead; and I could never do anything for him any more."</s> </p>

<p pid="851" id="settlers.c0.p851"><s>Here a burst of grief stopped her voice.</s> <s>Her brother said, very solemnly,--</s> </p>

<p pid="852" id="settlers.c0.p852"><s>"Now, Mildred, listen to me,--to the little I can say--for you know I cannot, in this place, stay and talk with you as we should both like, and as we might have done at home.</s> <s>I think you were almost always very kind to Geordie; and I am sure he loved you very dearly.</s> <s>But I have heard mother say that the worst part of losing dear friends is that we have to blame ourselves, more or less, for our behaviour to them,--even to those we loved the very most.</s> <s>So I will not flatter you, dear: though I don't at all wonder at your being tired of hearing Geordie cry that day.</s> <s>I will not say whether you were right or wrong; but only put you in mind that we may always ask for pardon.</s> <s>Remember, too, that you may meet Geordie again; and perhaps be kinder to him than we ever are to one another here.</s> <s>Now I will go, and come back again soon."</s> </p>

<p pid="853" id="settlers.c0.p853"><s>"Stop one minute," implored Mildred.</s> <s>"I dreamed that you all went away from this hill, and left me alone."</s> </p>

<p pid="854" id="settlers.c0.p854"><s>As she said this, she looked at her brother, with such a painful wistfulness, that he saw that she had had a fever-dream, and was not yet quite clear from its remains.</s> <s>He laughed, as at something ridiculous; which Mildred seemed to like: and then he reminded her more gravely, that they could not get away from this place if they would.</s> <s>If an opportunity should occur, he assured her he would not leave hold of her hand.</s> <s>Nothing should make him step into a boat without her.</s> <s>Poor Mildred had fancied, bewildered as she was this morning, that if Oliver knew of what she had done about George, he would think himself justified in leaving her to perish on the hill; and yet she could not help telling him.</s> <s>Her mind was relieved, for the present, and she let him go.</s> </p>

<p pid="855" id="settlers.c0.p855"><s>He found Roger where he first looked for him,--near the mummy.</s> <s>The poor lad was too ill to stand; but he lay on the slimy bank, poking and grubbing, with a stick and with his fingers, as deep in the soft soil as he could penetrate.</s> <s>Oliver saw that he had found some more curiosities;--bunches of nuts,--nuts which were ripening on the tree many hundreds of seasons ago; but which no hand had plucked till now.</s> <s>Oliver could neither wonder nor admire, at this moment: nor was he vexed (as he might have been at another time) at Roger's crawling hither, in pursuit of gain, to be made more ill by every breath he drew while stooping over the rank mud.</s> </p>

<p pid="856" id="settlers.c0.p856"><s>"Don't be afraid, Roger," said Oliver.</s> <s>"I am not going to touch your findings, or meddle with you.</s> <s>I want you to change your clothes,--to put off that finery,--and to let me know where the bag of money is that you took out of the chest."</s> </p>

<p pid="896" id="settlers.c0.p896"><s>"He was carried off in the mill,--out to the Humber--"</s> </p>

<p pid="897" id="settlers.c0.p897"><s>Oliver stopped, as he saw the men exchange a look of awe, which took his breath away again.</s> </p>

<p pid="898" id="settlers.c0.p898"><s>"We have something like news of your father too, Oliver.</s> <s>There is a rumour which makes us hope that he may be safe at a distance.</s> <s>Your mother believes it, as she will tell you.</s> <s>Is it possible that you are all alive, after such a calamity as this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="899" id="settlers.c0.p899"><s>"George is dead, sir.</s> <s>We buried him yesterday.</s> <s>Ailwin is here, with Mildred and me; and Roger Redfurn."</s> </p>

<p pid="900" id="settlers.c0.p900"><s>One of the men observed that he had hoped, as one good that would come of the flood, that the Levels were rid of the Redfurns.</s> </p>

<p pid="901" id="settlers.c0.p901"><s>"Do not say that," said Oliver.</s> <s>"Roger has helped us in many things; and he was kind to little George.</s> <s>Let me go, sir.</s> <s>I can walk now very well: and I want to tell them that you are come."</s> </p>

<p pid="902" id="settlers.c0.p902"><s>"Go, my boy: but do it gently, Oliver,--gently."</s> </p>

<p pid="903" id="settlers.c0.p903"><s>"That is what I want, sir,--that they should not see or hear you: for Mildred is ill,--and Roger too.</s> <s>Please keep out of sight till I come for you.</s> <s>So mother is safe,--really?"</s> </p>

<p pid="904" id="settlers.c0.p904"><s>"Really, and we will take you all to her."</s> </p>

<p pid="905" id="settlers.c0.p905"><s>Mildred, lying uncomfortably in the soaked cloth (for the rain had penetrated everything), was yet dozing,--now and then starting and calling out.</s> <s>Oliver took her hand, to wake her up, and asked her, with a smile, as she opened her eyes, whether she was dreaming of a boat again.</s> <s>Mildred believed not, but her head was sadly confused; so much so, that she heard of the boat which had really come, and the pastor and her parents, without showing any surprise or pleasure.</s> <s>Little ceremony was necessary with the strong Ailwin; and one of the men made short work with Roger, by lifting him and carrying him into the boat.</s> <s>Oliver said a word to the pastor about seeing George's grave, and about the chest and the money-bag which belonged to somebody who might want them much.</s> <s>The pastor took charge of the bag, but declared that everything else must be left for another trip, at a more leisure time.</s> <s>Mrs Linacre was waiting,--and in what a state of expectation!</s> </p>

<p pid="906" id="settlers.c0.p906"><s>While the two stout rowers were pulling rapidly away from the Red-hill, and in the direction of Gainsborough, the pastor explained to the party what they most wanted to know.</s> <s>Mrs Linacre had heard some rumour which alarmed her on the day of the flood, and had locked up her shed, and set out homewards when the waters gushed over her road, and compelled her to turn back.</s> <s>Like a multitude of others, as anxious and miserable as herself, she had ever since been wandering about in search of a boat, and imploring aid from every one she met.</s> </p>

<p pid="907" id="settlers.c0.p907"><s>For three days, it appeared as if there really were no boats in all the district.</s> <s>Some had certainly been swamped and broken by the rush of the flood: and there was great difficulty in bringing round from the coast such as could there be had from the fishermen.</s> <s>Some farmers on the hill had lent their oxen, to bring boats over the hills; and others, men to row them; and this was in time to save many lives.</s> <s>What number had been lost, it was impossible yet to say; but the cleverness and the hopefulness with which a multitude had struggled for life, during five days of hardship and peril were wonderful and admirable.</s> <s>Mrs Linacre had trusted in the power which God gives his children in such extremity, and had been persuaded throughout (except during short moments of despair), that she should see her husband and children again.</s> <s>In this persuasion she had been sustained by the pastor, from the moment of his finding her, after his own escape.</s> </p>

<p pid="908" id="settlers.c0.p908"><s>Of his own escape the pastor would say nothing at present.</s> <s>The children's minds were too full now for such tales of wonder and of horror as they must hear hereafter.</s> <s>Neither would he permit a word on the origin of the flood.</s> <s>He said they must think as little as they could of the wicked deeds of men, in this hour of God's mercy.</s> <s>One prayer, in every heart, that God would forgive all evil-minded men,--one such prayer let there be; and then, no more disturbing thoughts of enemies in the hour of preservation.</s> </p>

<p pid="909" id="settlers.c0.p909" type="speech"><s>Oliver could not trust himself to ask, in the presence of strangers, what the rumour was, which the pastor had mentioned, about his father.</s> <s>The pastor was very apt to understand what was stirring in people's hearts; and he knew Oliver's at this moment.</s> <s>He explained to him that a sailor had declared, on landing at Hull, that the ship in which he was had spoken with a Dutch vessel, off the Humber, in the night, by the light of lanterns only, when a voice was heard, as if from the deck of the Dutchman, crying out, <qs/>"Will some one have the charity to tell the wife of Linacre of the Levels that he is saved?"<qe/></s> <s>The sailors had some fears about this voice--thought the message odd--fancied the voice was like what they should suppose a ghost's to be; and at length, persuaded one another that it came, not from any ship, but from the air overhead; and that the message meant that Linacre was dead, and that his soul was saved.</s> <s>When they came ashore, however, and found what had befallen the Levels, they began to doubt whether it was not, after all, the voice of a flesh and blood man that had called out to them.</s> <s>When the pastor now heard how the miller was floated off in his mill, he had little doubt of the good man having been picked up in the Humber, by a vessel sailing for Holland, which could not stop to set him ashore, but which now contained him, safe and well.</s> <s>Within two months, he would be heard of or seen, it might fairly be hoped.</s> </p>

<p pid="910" id="settlers.c0.p910"><s>Mrs Linacre was kindly taken care of in a farm-house, near the spring-- that farm-house where she had often taken her copper money to be changed for silver: but she had been little within doors, day or night.</s> <s>She had paced all day by the brink of the flood; and as long as the moon was up, had sat at night on a rising ground, looking over the waters towards the Red-hill.</s> <s>She had discovered that the mill was gone, when other eyes could distinguish nothing so far off.</s> <s>No one had a glass to lend her-- so, at least, it was said; but some whispered that a glass might have been procured, but that it was thought she could see only what would distress her, and nothing that could do her any good.</s> </p>

<p pid="911" id="settlers.c0.p911"><s>She was on the brink of the water when the boat came near.</s> <s>She would have thrown herself in to meet her children, if a neighbour had not been there to hold her back.</s> </p>

<p pid="912" id="settlers.c0.p912"><s>Oliver's first words to her were, that he believed his father was safe on his way to Holland, and would soon be coming back.</s> <s>The pastor's first words were, as he placed Mildred in her arms--</s> </p>

<p pid="913" id="settlers.c0.p913"><s>"Two children are here restored to you.</s> <s>Will you not patiently resign your other little one?"</s> </p>

<p pid="914" id="settlers.c0.p914"><s>The speechless mother was hurrying away, with Mildred on her bosom, and drawing Oliver by the hand, which she clasped convulsively, when he said--</s> </p>

<p pid="915" id="settlers.c0.p915"><s>"Mother, help me to keep a promise I have made.</s> <s>Here is Roger Redfurn-- very ill.  I promised we would not forsake him.</s> <s>Let him go with us, till he is well."</s> </p>

<p pid="917" id="settlers.c0.p917"><s>"Go on," said the pastor.</s> <s>"We are bringing Roger after you.</s> <s>We shall be at home as soon as you."</s> </p>

<p pid="918" id="settlers.c0.p918"><s>"Home," was the friendly farm-house.</s> <s>There, before the end of the day, had Oliver learned that his morning signal had been seen from the large boat; and that the reason why the large boat had rowed away was, not only that it was full, but that the waters were now too shallow about the Red-hill for any but small craft.</s> <s>Before the end of the day Mrs Linacre had been seen to look like herself once more; and Ailwin had told to the wondering neighbours the tale of the few days, which seemed now like years to look back upon.</s> <s>She told more than even Oliver had observed of the miserable state of their place of refuge, which would soon have been a place of death.</s> <s>Scarcely a breathing thing, she said, was left alive: and, in going to the boat, she had seen the soaked bee-hives upset, and the chilled bees lying about, as if there was no spirit left in them.</s> <s>She shuddered when she thought of the Red-hill.</s> <s>Then she stimulated the farm-house people to take care of Roger,--a task in which Oliver left them little to do.</s> <s>They were willing enough, however; for Ailwin told them that though Roger had been an odd boy in his time, owing to his having been brought up by queer people, yet, considering that those people were drowned and gone, and that Roger had been noticed by a lord, she did not doubt he might turn out well, if it so pleased God.</s> </p>

<p pid="919" id="settlers.c0.p919"><s>How closely did Mildred clasp her mother's neck that evening!</s> <s>Knowing nothing else, and feeling very strangely, she yet understood that she was in a place of shelter and comfort, and felt that her head rested on her mother's bosom--on that pillow which has something so far better than all warmth and softness.</s> <s>By degrees she began to be aware that there was cool and fresh water, and sweet-smelling flowers, and that she was tenderly bathed, and laid to rest on a bed which was neither wet nor under a tree.</s> <s>There was a surprising silence all round her, she felt, as she grew stronger, which no one yet attempted to explain to her; but her mother smiled at her so happily, that she supposed she was recovering.</s> </p>

<p pid="920" id="settlers.c0.p920"><s>Mrs Linacre did look happy, even in the midst of her tears for her poor baby.</s> <s>Mildred _was_ recovering, Oliver ate and slept, and whistled under the window--like a light-hearted boy, as he once again amused himself with carving every piece of hard wood he could find.</s> <s>It was clear that he had escaped the fever; and every day that refreshed his colour, and filled out his thin face again, brought nearer the hour of his father's return.</s> </p>
