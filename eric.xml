<p pid="2" id="eric.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="eric.c1.s3"><qs/>"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"<qe/> cried a young boy, as he capered vigorously about, and clapped his hands.</s> <s sid="4" id="eric.c1.s4"><qs/>"Papa and mamma will be home in a week now, and then we shall stay here a little time, and _then_, and _then_, I shall go to school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="eric.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="eric.c1.s5">The last words were enunciated with immense importance, as he stopped his impromptu dance before the chair where his sober cousin Fanny was patiently working at her crochet; but she did not look so much affected by the announcement as the boy seemed to demand, so he again exclaimed, <qs/>"And then, Miss Fanny, I shall go to school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="eric.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="eric.c1.s6"><qs/>"Well, Eric,"<qe/><sls/> said Fanny, raising her matter-of-fact quiet face from her endless work, <sle/><qs/>"I doubt, dear, whether you will talk of it with quite as much joy a year hence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="eric.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="eric.c1.s8">She looked up from her work after he had gone, and sighed.</s> <s sid="9" id="eric.c1.s9">In spite of the sunshine and balm of the bright weather, a sense of heaviness and foreboding oppressed her.</s> <s sid="10" id="eric.c1.s10">Everything looked smiling and beautiful, and there was an almost irresistible contagion in the mirth of her young cousin, but still she could not help feeling sad.</s> <s sid="11" id="eric.c1.s11">It was not merely that she would have to part with Eric, <qs/>"but that bright boy,"<qe/><sss/> thought Fanny, <sse/><qs/>"what will become of him?</s> <s sid="12" id="eric.c1.s12">I have heard strange things of schools; oh, if he should be spoilt and ruined, what misery it would be.</s> <s sid="13" id="eric.c1.s13">Those baby lips, that pure young heart, a year may work sad change in their words and thoughts!"<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="eric.c1.s14">She sighed again, and her eyes glistened as she raised them upwards, and breathed a silent prayer.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="eric.c1.p7"><s sid="15" id="eric.c1.s15">She loved the boy dearly, and had taught him from his earliest years.</s> <s sid="16" id="eric.c1.s16">In most things she found him an apt pupil.</s> <s sid="17" id="eric.c1.s17">Truthful, ingenuous, quick, he would acquire almost without effort any subject that interested him, and a word was often enough to bring the impetuous blood to his cheeks, in a flush, of pride or indignation.</s> <s sid="18" id="eric.c1.s18">He required the gentlest teaching, and had received it, while his mind seemed cast in such a mould of stainless honor that he avoided most of the faults to which children are prone.</s> <s sid="19" id="eric.c1.s19">But he was far from blameless.</s> <s sid="20" id="eric.c1.s20">He was proud to a fault; he well knew that few of his fellows had gifts like his, either of mind or person, and his fair face often showed a clear impression of his own superiority.</s> <s sid="21" id="eric.c1.s21">His passion, too, was imperious, and though it always met with prompt correction, his cousin had latterly found it difficult to subdue.</s> <s sid="22" id="eric.c1.s22">She felt, in a word, that he was outgrowing her rule.</s> <s sid="23" id="eric.c1.s23">Beyond a certain age no boy of spirit can be safely guided by a woman's hand alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="eric.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="eric.c1.s24">Eric Williams was now twelve years old.</s> <s sid="25" id="eric.c1.s25">His father was a civilian in India, and was returning on furlough to England after a long absence.</s> <s sid="26" id="eric.c1.s26">Eric had been born in India, but had been sent to England by his parents at an early age, in charge of a lady friend of his mother.</s> <s sid="27" id="eric.c1.s27">The parting, which had been agony to his father and mother, he was too young to feel; indeed the moment itself passed by without his being conscious of it.</s> <s sid="28" id="eric.c1.s28">They took him on board the ship, and, after a time, gave him a hammer and some nails to play with.</s> <s sid="29" id="eric.c1.s29">These had always been to him a supreme delight, and while he hammered away, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, denying themselves, for the child's sake, even one more tearful embrace, went ashore in the boat and left him.</s> <s sid="30" id="eric.c1.s30">It was not till the ship sailed that he was told he would not see them again for a long, long time.</s> <s sid="31" id="eric.c1.s31">Poor child, his tears and cries were wild when he first understood it; but the sorrows of four years old are very transient, and before a week was over, little Eric felt almost reconciled to his position, and had become the universal pet and plaything of every one on board, from Captain Broadland down to the cabin boy, with whom he very soon struck up an acquaintance.</s> <s sid="32" id="eric.c1.s32">Yet twice a day at least, he would shed a tear, as he lisped his little prayer, kneeling at Mrs. Munro's knee, and asked God <qs/>"to bless his dear dear father and mother, and make him a good boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="eric.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="eric.c1.s33">When Eric arrived in England, he was intrusted to the care of a widowed aunt, whose daughter, Fanny, had the main charge of his early teaching.</s> <s sid="34" id="eric.c1.s34">At first, the wayward little Indian seemed likely to form no accession to the quiet household, but he soon became its brightest ornament and pride.</s> <s sid="35" id="eric.c1.s35">Everything was in his favor at the pleasant home of Mrs. Trevor.</s> <s sid="36" id="eric.c1.s36">He was treated with motherly kindness and tenderness, yet firmly checked when he went wrong.</s> <s sid="37" id="eric.c1.s37">From the first he had a well-spring of strength, against temptation, in the long letters which every mail brought from his parents; and all his childish affections were entwined round the fancied image of a brother born since he had left India.</s> <s sid="38" id="eric.c1.s38">In his bed-room there hung a cherub's head, drawn in pencil by his mother, and this picture was inextricably identified in his imagination with his <qs/>"little brother Vernon."<qe/></s> <s sid="39" id="eric.c1.s39">He loved it dearly, and whenever he went astray, nothing weighed on his mind so strongly as the thought, that if he were naughty he would teach little Vernon to be naughty too when he came home.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="eric.c1.p10"><s sid="40" id="eric.c1.s40">And Nature also--wisest, gentlest, holiest of teachers-was with him in his childhood.</s> <s sid="41" id="eric.c1.s41">Fairholm Cottage, where his aunt lived, was situated in the beautiful Vale of Ayrton, and a clear stream ran through the valley at the bottom of Mrs. Trevor's orchard.</s> <s sid="42" id="eric.c1.s42">Eric loved this stream, and was always happy as he roamed by its side, or over the low green hills and scattered dingles, which lent unusual loveliness to every winding of its waters.</s> <s sid="43" id="eric.c1.s43">He was allowed to go about a good deal by himself, and it did him good.</s> <s sid="44" id="eric.c1.s44">He grew up fearless and self-dependent, and never felt the want of amusement.</s> <s sid="45" id="eric.c1.s45">The garden and orchard supplied him a theatre for endless games and romps, sometimes with no other companion than his cousin and his dog, and sometimes with the few children of his own age whom he knew in the hamlet.</s> <s sid="46" id="eric.c1.s46">Very soon he forgot all about India; it only hung like a distant golden haze on the horizon of his memory.</s> <s sid="47" id="eric.c1.s47">When asked if he remembered it, he would say thoughtfully, that in dreams and at some other times, he saw a little child, with long curly hair, running about in a little garden, near a great river, in a place where the air was very bright.</s> <s sid="48" id="eric.c1.s48">But whether the little boy was himself or his brother Vernon, whom he had never seen, he couldn't quite tell.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="eric.c1.p11"><s sid="49" id="eric.c1.s49">But above all, it was happy for Eric that his training was religious and enlightened.</s> <s sid="50" id="eric.c1.s50">With Mrs. Trevor and her daughter, religion was not a system but a habit--not a theory, but a continued act of life.</s> <s sid="51" id="eric.c1.s51">All was simple, sweet, and unaffected about their charity and their devotions.</s> <s sid="52" id="eric.c1.s52">They loved God, and they did all the good they could to those around them.</s> <s sid="53" id="eric.c1.s53">The floating gossip and ill-nature of the little village never affected them; it melted away insensibly in the presence of their cultivated minds; and so friendship with them was a bond of union among all, and from the vicar to the dairyman every one loved and respected them, asked their counsel, and sought their sympathy.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="eric.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="eric.c1.s54">They called themselves by no sectarian name, nor could they have told to what <qs/>"party"<qe/> they belonged.</s> <s sid="55" id="eric.c1.s55">They troubled themselves with no theories of education, but mingled gentle nurture with <qs/>"wholesome neglect."<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="eric.c1.s56">There was nothing exotic or constrained in the growth of Eric's character.</s> <s sid="57" id="eric.c1.s57">He was not one of your angelically good children at all, and knew none of the phrases of which infant prodigies are supposed to be so fond.</s> <s sid="58" id="eric.c1.s58">He had not been taught any distinction between <qs/>"Sunday books"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"week-day"<qe/> books, but no book had been put in his way that was not healthy and genuine in tone.</s> <s sid="59" id="eric.c1.s59">He had not been told that he might use his Noah's ark on Sunday, because it was <qs/>"a Sunday plaything,"<qe/> while all other toys were on that day forbidden.</s> <s sid="60" id="eric.c1.s60">Of these things the Trevors thought little; they only saw that no child could be happy in enforced idleness or constrained employment; and so Eric grew up to love Sunday quite as well as any other day in the week, though, unlike your angelic children, he never professed to like it better.</s> <s sid="61" id="eric.c1.s61">But to be truthful, to be honest, to be kind, to be brave, these had been taught him, and he never _quite_ forgot the lesson; nor amid the sorrows of after life did he ever quite lose the sense--learnt at dear quiet Fairholm--of a present loving God, of a tender and long-suffering Father.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="eric.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="eric.c1.s62">As yet he could be hardly said to know what school was.</s> <s sid="63" id="eric.c1.s63">He had been sent indeed to Mr. Lawley's grammar-school for the last half-year, and had learned a few declensions in his Latin grammar.</s> <s sid="64" id="eric.c1.s64">But as Mr. Lawley allowed his upper class to hear the little boys their lessons, Eric had managed to get on pretty much as he liked.</s> <s sid="65" id="eric.c1.s65">Only _once_ in the entire half-year had he said a lesson to the dreadful master himself, and of course it was a ruinous failure, involving some tremendous pulls of Eric's hair, and making him tremble like a leaf.</s> <s sid="66" id="eric.c1.s66">Several things combined to make Mr. Lawley dreadful to his imagination.</s> <s sid="67" id="eric.c1.s67">Ever since he was quite little, he remembered hearing the howls which proceeded from the <qs/>"Latin school"<qe/> as he passed by, whilst some luckless youngster was getting caned; and the reverend pedagogue was notoriously passionate.</s> <s sid="68" id="eric.c1.s68">Then, again, he spoke so indistinctly with his deep, gruff voice, that Eric never could and never did syllable a word he said, and this kept him in a perpetual terror.</s> <s sid="69" id="eric.c1.s69">Once Mr. Lawley had told him to go out, and see what time it was by the church clock.</s> <s sid="70" id="eric.c1.s70">Only hearing that he was to do something, too frightened to ask what it was, and feeling sure that even if he did, he should not understand what the master said, Eric ran out, went straight to Mr. Lawley's house, and after having managed by strenuous jumps to touch the knocker, informed the servant <qs/>"that Mr. Lawley wanted his man."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="eric.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="eric.c1.s71"><qs/>"What man?"<qe/><sss/> said the maid-servant, <sse/><qs/>"the young man? or the butler? or is it the clerk?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="eric.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="eric.c1.s72">Here was a puzzler! all Eric knew was that he was in the habit of sending sometimes for one or the other of these functionaries; but he was in for it, so with a faltering voice he said <qs/>"the young man"<qe/> at hazard, and went back to the Latin school.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="eric.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="eric.c1.s73"><qs/>"Why have you been so long?"<qe/> roared Mr. Lawley, as he timidly entered.</s> <s sid="74" id="eric.c1.s74">Fear entirely prevented Eric from hearing what was said, so he answered at random, <qs/>"He's coming, sir."<qe/></s> <s sid="75" id="eric.c1.s75">The master, seeing by his scared look that something was wrong, waited to see what would turn up.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="eric.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="eric.c1.s76">Soon after, in walked <qs/>"the young man,"<qe/><sls/> and coming to the astonished Mr. Lawley, bowed, scraped, and said, <sle/><qs/>"Master Williams said you sent for me, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="eric.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="eric.c1.s77"><qs/>"A mistake,"<qe/> growled the schoolmaster, turning on Eric a look which nearly petrified him; he quite expected a book at his head, or at best a great whack of the cane; but Mr. Lawley had naturally a kind heart, soured as it was, and pitying perhaps the child's white face, he contented himself with the effects of his look.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="eric.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="eric.c1.s78">The simple truth was, that poor Mr. Lawley was a little wrong in the head.</s> <s sid="79" id="eric.c1.s79">A scholar and a gentleman, early misfortunes and an imprudent marriage had driven him to the mastership of the little country grammar-school; and here the perpetual annoyance caused to his refined mind by the coarseness of clumsy or spiteful boys, had gradually unhinged his intellect.</s> <s sid="80" id="eric.c1.s80">Often did he tell the boys <qs/>"that it was an easier life by far to break stones by the roadside than to teach them;"<qe/> and at last his eccentricities became too obvious to be any longer overlooked.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="eric.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="eric.c1.s81">The denouement of his history was a tragic one, and had come a few days before the time when, our narrative opens.</s> <s sid="82" id="eric.c1.s82">It was a common practice among the Latin school boys, as I suppose among all boys, to amuse themselves by putting a heavy book on the top of a door left partially ajar, and to cry out <qs/>"Crown him"<qe/> as the first luckless youngster who happened to come in received the book thundering on his head.</s> <s sid="83" id="eric.c1.s83">One day, just as the trap had been adroitly laid, Mr. Lawley walked in unexpectedly.</s> <s sid="84" id="eric.c1.s84">The moment he entered the school-room, down came an Ainsworth's Dictionary on the top of his hat, and the boy, concealed behind the door, unconscious of who the victim was, enunciated with mock gravity, <qs/>"Crown him! three cheers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="eric.c1.p21"><s sid="85" id="eric.c1.s85">It took Mr. Lawley a second to raise from his eyebrows the battered hat, and recover from his confusion; the next instant he was springing after the boy who had caused the mishap, and who, knowing the effects of the master's fury, fled with precipitation.</s> <s sid="86" id="eric.c1.s86">In one minute the offender was caught, and Mr. Lawley's heavy hand fell recklessly on his ears and back, until he screamed with terror.</s> <s sid="87" id="eric.c1.s87">At last by a tremendous writhe, wrenching himself free, he darted towards the door, and Mr. Lawley, too exhausted to pursue, snatched his large gold watch out of his fob, and hurled it at the boy's retreating figure.</s> <s sid="88" id="eric.c1.s88">The watch flew through the air;--crash! it had missed its aim, and, striking the wall above the lintel, fell smashed into a thousand shivers.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="eric.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="eric.c1.s89">The sound, the violence of the action, the sight of the broken watch, which was the gift of a cherished friend, instantly woke the master to his senses.</s> <s sid="90" id="eric.c1.s90">The whole school had seen it; they sate there pale and breathless with excitement and awe.</s> <s sid="91" id="eric.c1.s91">The poor man could bear it no longer.</s> <s sid="92" id="eric.c1.s92">He flung himself into his chair, hid his face with his hands, and burst into hysterical tears.</s> <s sid="93" id="eric.c1.s93">It was the outbreak of feelings long pent up.</s> <s sid="94" id="eric.c1.s94">In that instant all his life passed before him--its hopes, its failures, its miseries, its madness.</s> <s sid="95" id="eric.c1.s95"><qs/>"Yes!"<qe/><sss/> he thought, <sse/><qs/>"I am mad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="eric.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="eric.c1.s96">Raising his head, he cried wildly, <qs/>"Boys, go, I am mad!"<qe/> and sank again into his former position, rocking himself to and fro.</s> <s sid="97" id="eric.c1.s97">One by one the boys stole out, and he was left alone.</s> <s sid="98" id="eric.c1.s98">The end is soon told.</s> <s sid="99" id="eric.c1.s99">Forced to leave Ayrton, he had no means of earning his daily bread; and the weight of this new anxiety hastening the crisis, the handsome proud scholar became an inmate of the Brerely Lunatic Asylum.</s> <s sid="100" id="eric.c1.s100">A few years afterwards, Eric heard that he was dead.</s> <s sid="101" id="eric.c1.s101">Poor broken human heart! may he rest in peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="eric.c1.p24"><s sid="102" id="eric.c1.s102">Such was Eric's first school and schoolmaster.</s> <s sid="103" id="eric.c1.s103">But although he learnt little there, and gained no experience of the character of others or of his own, yet there was one point about Ayrton Latin School, which he never regretted.</s> <s sid="104" id="eric.c1.s104">It was the mixture there of all classes.</s> <s sid="105" id="eric.c1.s105">On those benches gentlemen's sons sat side by side with plebeians, and no harm, but only good, seemed to come from the intercourse.</s> <s sid="106" id="eric.c1.s106">The neighboring gentry, most of whom had begun their education there, were drawn into closer and kindlier union with their neighbors and dependents, from the fact of having been their associates in the days of their boyhood.</s> <s sid="107" id="eric.c1.s107">Many a time afterwards, when Eric, as he passed down the streets, interchanged friendly greetings with some young glazier or tradesman whom he remembered at school, he felt glad that thus early he had learnt practically to despise the accidental and nominal differences which separate man from man.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="eric.c3.p7" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="eric.c3.s36">Montagu's chief merit was, that he was such a thorough little gentleman; <qs/>"such a jolly little fellow"<qe/> every one said of him.</s> <s sid="37" id="eric.c3.s37">Without being clever or athletic, he managed to do very fairly both at work and at the games, and while he was too exclusive to make many _intimate_ friends, everybody liked walking about or talking with him.</s> <s sid="38" id="eric.c3.s38">Even Barker, blackguard as he was, seemed to be a little uneasy when confronted with Montagu's naturally noble and chivalrous bearing.</s> <s sid="39" id="eric.c3.s39">In nearly all respects his influence was thoroughly good, and few boys were more generally popular.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="eric.c3.p8"><s sid="40" id="eric.c3.s40">Owen, again, was a very different boy.</s> <s sid="41" id="eric.c3.s41">His merit was a ceaseless diligence, in which it was doubtful whether ambition or conscientiousness had the greatest share.</s> <s sid="42" id="eric.c3.s42">Reserved and thoughtful, unfitted for or indifferent to most games, he was anything but a favorite with the rest, and Eric rather respected than liked him.</s> <s sid="43" id="eric.c3.s43">When he first came, he had been one of the most natural butts for Barker's craving ill-nature, and for a time he had been tremendously bullied.</s> <s sid="44" id="eric.c3.s44">But gradually his mental superiority asserted itself.</s> <s sid="45" id="eric.c3.s45">He took everything without tears and without passion, and this diminished the pleasure of annoying him.</s> <s sid="46" id="eric.c3.s46">One day when Barker had given him an unprovoked kick, he quietly said,</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="eric.c3.p11" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="eric.c3.s50">Mr. Gordon didn't like <qs/>"telling,"<qe/> and he said so to Owen, without reserve.</s> <s sid="51" id="eric.c3.s51">An ordinary boy would have broken into a flood of explanations and palliations, but Owen simply bowed, and said nothing.</s> <s sid="52" id="eric.c3.s52"><qs/>"He stood there for justice,"<qe/> and he had counted the cost.</s> <s sid="53" id="eric.c3.s53">Strong-minded and clear-headed, he calculated correctly that the momentary dislike of his schoolfellows, with whom he well knew that he never could be popular, would be less unbearable than Barker's villanous insults.</s> <s sid="54" id="eric.c3.s54">The consequence was that Barker was caned soundly, although, with some injustice, Mr. Gordon made no attempt to conceal that he did it unwillingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="eric.c3.p12" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="eric.c3.s55">Of course the fellows were very indignant with Owen for sneaking, as they called it, and for a week or two he had the keen mortification of seeing <qs/>"Owen is a sneak,"<qe/> written up all about the walls.</s> <s sid="56" id="eric.c3.s56">But he was too proud or too cold to make any defence till called upon, and bore it in silence.</s> <s sid="57" id="eric.c3.s57">Barker vowed eternal vengeance, and the very day after, had seized Owen with the avowed intention of <qs/>"half murdering him."<qe/></s> <s sid="58" id="eric.c3.s58">But before he could once strike him, Owen said in the most chill tone, <qs/>"Barker, if you touch me, I shall go straight to Dr. Rowlands."<qe/></s> <s sid="59" id="eric.c3.s59">The bully well knew that Owen never broke his word, but he could not govern his rage, and first giving Owen a violent shake, he proceeded to thrash him without limit or remorse.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="eric.c3.p13"><s sid="60" id="eric.c3.s60">Pale, but unmoved, Owen got away, and walked straight to Dr. Rowlands' door.</s> <s sid="61" id="eric.c3.s61">The thing was unheard of, and the boys were amazed at his temerity, for the doctor was to all their imaginations a regular _Deus ex machina._ That afternoon, again Barker was publicly caned, with the threat that the next offence would be followed by instant and public expulsion.</s> <s sid="62" id="eric.c3.s62">This punishment he particularly dreaded, because he was intended for the army, and he well knew that it might ruin his prospects.</s> <s sid="63" id="eric.c3.s63">The consequence was, that Owen never suffered from him again, although he daily received a shower of oaths and curses, which he passed over with silent contempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="eric.c3.p14" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="eric.c3.s64">My dear boy-reader, don't suppose that I want you to imitate Owen in this matter.</s> <s sid="65" id="eric.c3.s65">I despise a boy who <qs/>"tells"<qe/> as much as you do, and it is a far better and braver thing to bear bullying with such a mixture of spirit and good humor, as in time to disarm it.</s> <s sid="66" id="eric.c3.s66">But Owen was a peculiar boy, and remember he had _no_ redress.</s> <s sid="67" id="eric.c3.s67">He bore for a time, until he felt that he _must_ have the justice and defence, without which it would have been impossible for him to continue at Roslyn school.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="eric.c3.p15"><s sid="68" id="eric.c3.s68">But why, you ask, didn't he tell the monitors?</s> <s sid="69" id="eric.c3.s69">Unfortunately at Roslyn the monitorial system was not established.</s> <s sid="70" id="eric.c3.s70">Although it was a school of 250 boys, the sixth form, with all their privileges, had no prerogative of authority.</s> <s sid="71" id="eric.c3.s71">They hadn't the least right to interfere, because no such power had been delegated to them, and therefore they felt themselves merely on a par with the rest, except for such eminence as their intellectual superiority gave them.</s> <s sid="72" id="eric.c3.s72">The consequence was, that any interference from them would have been of a simply individual nature, and was exerted very rarely.</s> <s sid="73" id="eric.c3.s73">It would have done Owen no more good to tell a sixth-form boy, than to tell any other boy; and as he was not a favorite, he was not likely to find any champion to fight his battles or maintain his just rights.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="eric.c3.p16"><s sid="74" id="eric.c3.s74">All this had happened before Eric's time, and he heard it from his best friend Russell.</s> <s sid="75" id="eric.c3.s75">His heart clave to that boy.</s> <s sid="76" id="eric.c3.s76">They became friends at once by a kind of electric sympathy; the first glance of each at the other's face prepared the friendship, and every day of acquaintance more firmly cemented it.</s> <s sid="77" id="eric.c3.s77">Eric could not have had a better friend; not so clever as himself, not so diligent as Owen, not so athletic as Duncan, or so fascinating as Montagu, Russell combined the best qualities of them all.</s> <s sid="78" id="eric.c3.s78">And, above all, he acted invariably from the highest principle; he presented that noblest of all noble spectacles--one so rare that many think it impossible--the spectacle of an honorable, pure-hearted, happy boy, who, as his early years speed by, is ever growing in wisdom, and stature, and favor with God and man.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="eric.c29.p26"><s sid="46" id="eric.c29.s46">Knowing how strong an interest Mr. Rose always took in Eric, I gave him a copy of these verses when last I visited him at his pleasant vicarage of Seaford, to which he was presented a year or two ago by Dr. Rowlands, now Bishop of Roslyn, who has also appointed him examining chaplain.</s> <s sid="47" id="eric.c29.s47">I sat and watched Mr. Rose while he read them.</s> <s sid="48" id="eric.c29.s48">A mournful interest was depicted on his face, his hand trembled a little, and I fancied that he bent his grey hair over the paper to hide a tear.</s> <s sid="49" id="eric.c29.s49">We always knew at school that Eric was one of his greatest favorites, as indeed he and Vernon were with all of us; and when the unhappy boy had run away without even having the opportunity for bidding any one farewell, Mr. Rose displayed such real grief, that for weeks he was like a man who went mourning for a son.</s> <s sid="50" id="eric.c29.s50">After those summer holidays, when we returned to school, Montagu and Wildney brought back with them the intelligence of Eric's return to Fairholm, and of his death.</s> <s sid="51" id="eric.c29.s51">The news plunged many of us in sorrow, and when, on the first Sunday in chapel, Mr. Rose alluded to this sad tale, there were few dry eyes among those who listened to him.</s> <s sid="52" id="eric.c29.s52">I shall never forget that Sunday afternoon.</s> <s sid="53" id="eric.c29.s53">A deep hush brooded over us, and before the sermon was over, many a face was hidden to conceal the emotion which could not be suppressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="eric.c29.p31"><s sid="67" id="eric.c29.s67">The suggestion took me by surprise, but I thought over it, and at once began to accomplish it.</s> <s sid="68" id="eric.c29.s68">My own reminiscences of Eric were numerous and vivid, and several of my old schoolfellows and friends gladly supplied me with other particulars, especially the Bishop of Roslyn, Mr. Rose, Montagu, and Wildney.</s> <s sid="69" id="eric.c29.s69">So the story of Eric's ruin has been told, and told as he would have wished it done, with simple truth.</s> <s sid="70" id="eric.c29.s70">Noble Eric!</s> <s sid="71" id="eric.c29.s71">I do not fear that I have wronged your memory, and you I know would rejoice to think how sorrowful hours have lost something of their sorrow, as I wrote the scenes in so many of which we were engaged together in our school-boy days.</s> </p>
