<p pid="24" id="unlikely.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="unlikely.c1.s55">It was certainly the wrong omnibus because instead of jolting slowly along dusty streets, it went quickly and smoothly down a green lane, with flowers in the hedges, and green trees overhead.</s> <s sid="56" id="unlikely.c1.s56">Matilda was so delighted that she sat quite still, a very rare thing with her.</s> <s sid="57" id="unlikely.c1.s57">Pridmore was reading a penny story called <qs/>"The Vengeance of the Lady Constantia,"<qe/> so she did not notice anything.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="unlikely.c6.p3"><s sid="9" id="unlikely.c6.s9">A great many kings who were not at all respectable would have given their royal ears to be allowed to send their daughters to this school, but Miss Fitzroy Robinson was very firm about references, and the consequence was that all the really high-class kings were only too pleased to be permitted to pay ten thousand pounds a year for their daughters' education.</s> <s sid="10" id="unlikely.c6.s10">And so Miss Fitzroy Robinson was able to lay aside a few pounds as a provision for her old age.</s> <s sid="11" id="unlikely.c6.s11">And all the money she saved was invested in land.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="unlikely.c6.p4"><s sid="12" id="unlikely.c6.s12">Only one monarch refused to send his daughter to Miss Fitzroy Robinson, on the ground that so cheap a school could not be a really select one, and it was found out afterwards that his references were not at all satisfactory.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="unlikely.c6.p5"><s sid="13" id="unlikely.c6.s13">There were only six boarders, and of course the best masters were engaged to teach the royal pupils everything which their parents wished them to learn, and as the girls were never asked to do lessons except when they felt quite inclined, they all said it was the nicest school in the world, and cried at the very thought of being taken away.</s> <s sid="14" id="unlikely.c6.s14">Thus it happened that the six pupils were quite grown up and were just becoming parlour boarders when events began to occur.</s> <s sid="15" id="unlikely.c6.s15">Princess Daisy, the daughter of King Fortunatus, the ruling sovereign, was the only little girl in the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="unlikely.c6.p6"><s sid="16" id="unlikely.c6.s16">Now it was when she had been at school about a year, that a ring came at the front door-bell, and the maid-servant came to the schoolroom with a visiting card held in the corner of her apron--for her hands were wet because it was washing-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="unlikely.c6.p7" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="unlikely.c6.s17"><qs/>"A gentleman to see you, Miss,"<qe/> she said; and Miss Fitzroy Robinson was quite fluttered because she thought it might be a respectable monarch, with a daughter who wanted teaching.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="unlikely.c6.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="unlikely.c6.s41"><qs/>"It's quite impossible,"<qe/> said she, and she spoke firmly, for she knew from history how dangerous it is for a Magician to be allowed anywhere near a princess.</s> <s sid="42" id="unlikely.c6.s42">Some harm almost always comes of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="unlikely.c6.p19" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="unlikely.c6.s43"><qs/>"Oh, very well!"<qe/> said the Professor.</s> </p>
