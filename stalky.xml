<title>CHAPTER 1. "IN AMBUSH."</title>
<p pid="1" id="stalky.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="stalky.c1.s1">In summer all right-minded boys built huts in the furze-hill behind the College--little lairs whittled out of the heart of the prickly bushes, full of stumps, odd root-ends, and spikes, but, since they were strictly forbidden, palaces of delight.</s> <s sid="2" id="stalky.c1.s2">And for the fifth summer in succession, Stalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they reached the dignity of a study) had built like beavers a place of retreat and meditation, where they smoked.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="stalky.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="stalky.c1.s3">Now, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout, their house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the subtle red-haired school Sergeant, trust them.</s> <s sid="4" id="stalky.c1.s4">His business was to wear tennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil boys.</s> <s sid="5" id="stalky.c1.s5">Had he taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided, for Foxy knew the manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr. Prout, whose school-name, derived from the size of his feet, was Hoofer, to investigate on his own account; and it was the cautious Stalky who found the track of his pugs on the very floor of their lair one peaceful afternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten Prout and his works in a volume of Surtees and a new briar-wood pipe.</s> <s sid="6" id="stalky.c1.s6">Crusoe, at sight of the footprint, did not act more swiftly than Stalky.</s> <s sid="7" id="stalky.c1.s7">He removed the pipes, swept up all loose match-ends, and departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="stalky.c1.p3"><s sid="8" id="stalky.c1.s8">But it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his allies till he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President of the Natural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in contempt, Hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he knew how, begged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as candidates; confessed to a long-smothered interest in first-flowerings, early butterflies, and new arrivals, and volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the new life at once.</s> <s sid="9" id="stalky.c1.s9">Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was also an enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by chance-heard remarks from the three, and specially Beetle.</s> <s sid="10" id="stalky.c1.s10">So he was gracious to that repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his book.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="stalky.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="stalky.c1.s11">Then, and not till then, did Stalky seek Beetle and McTurk in their house form-room.</s> <s sid="12" id="stalky.c1.s12">They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon in the furze, which they called the "wuzzy."</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="stalky.c1.p5"><s sid="13" id="stalky.c1.s13">"All up," said Stalky, serenely.</s> <s sid="14" id="stalky.c1.s14">"I spotted Heffy's fairy feet round our hut after dinner.</s> <s sid="15" id="stalky.c1.s15">'Blessing they're so big."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="stalky.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="stalky.c1.s18">"Oh, no.</s> <s sid="19" id="stalky.c1.s19">Left 'em in the middle of the hut, of course.</s> <s sid="20" id="stalky.c1.s20">What a blind ass you are, Beetle!</s> <s sid="21" id="stalky.c1.s21">D'you think nobody thinks but yourself?</s> <s sid="22" id="stalky.c1.s22">Well, we can't use the hut any more.</s> <s sid="23" id="stalky.c1.s23">Hoofer will be watchin' it."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="stalky.c1.p8"><s sid="24" id="stalky.c1.s24">"'Bother!</s> <s sid="25" id="stalky.c1.s25">Likewise blow!'" said McTurk thoughtfully, unpacking the volumes with which his chest was cased.</s> <s sid="26" id="stalky.c1.s26">The boys carried their libraries between their belt and their collar.</s> <s sid="27" id="stalky.c1.s27">"Nice job!</s> <s sid="28" id="stalky.c1.s28">This means we're under suspicion for the rest of the term."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="stalky.c1.p9"><s sid="29" id="stalky.c1.s29">"Why?</s> <s sid="30" id="stalky.c1.s30">All that Heffy has found is a hut.</s> <s sid="31" id="stalky.c1.s31">He and Foxy will watch it.</s> <s sid="32" id="stalky.c1.s32">It's nothing to do with us; only we mustn't be seen that way for a bit."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="stalky.c1.p10"><s sid="33" id="stalky.c1.s33">"Yes, and where else are we to go?" said Beetle.</s> <s sid="34" id="stalky.c1.s34">"You chose that place, too--an'--an' I wanted to read this afternoon."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="stalky.c1.p11"><s sid="35" id="stalky.c1.s35">Stalky sat on a desk drumming his heels on the form.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="stalky.c1.p12"><s sid="36" id="stalky.c1.s36">"You're a despondin' brute, Beetle.</s> <s sid="37" id="stalky.c1.s37">Sometimes I think I shall have to drop you altogether.</s> <s sid="38" id="stalky.c1.s38">Did you ever know your Uncle Stalky forget you yet?</s> <s sid="39" id="stalky.c1.s39">_His rebus infectis_--after I'd seen Heffy's man-tracks marchin' round our hut, I found little Hartopp--_destricto ense_--wavin' a butterfly-net.</s> <s sid="40" id="stalky.c1.s40">I conciliated Hartopp.</s> <s sid="41" id="stalky.c1.s41">'Told him that you'd read papers to the Bug-hunters if he'd let you join, Beetle.</s> <s sid="42" id="stalky.c1.s42">'Told him you liked butterflies, Turkey.</s> <s sid="43" id="stalky.c1.s43">Anyhow, I soothed the Hartoffles, and we're Bug-hunters now."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="stalky.c1.p13"><s sid="44" id="stalky.c1.s44">"What's the good of that?" said Beetle.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="stalky.c1.p14"><s sid="45" id="stalky.c1.s45">"Oh, Turkey, kick him!"</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="stalky.c1.p15"><s sid="46" id="stalky.c1.s46">In the interests of science bounds were largely relaxed for the members of the Natural History Society.</s> <s sid="47" id="stalky.c1.s47">They could wander, if they kept clear of all houses, practically where they chose; Mr. Hartopp holding himself responsible for their good conduct.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="stalky.c1.p16"><s sid="48" id="stalky.c1.s48">Beetle began to see this as McTurk began the kicking.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="stalky.c1.p17"><s sid="49" id="stalky.c1.s49">"I'm an ass, Stalky!" he said, guarding the afflicted part.</s> <s sid="50" id="stalky.c1.s50">"_Pax_, Turkey.</s> <s sid="51" id="stalky.c1.s51">I'm an ass."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="stalky.c1.p18"><s sid="52" id="stalky.c1.s52">"Don't stop, Turkey.</s> <s sid="53" id="stalky.c1.s53">Isn't your Uncle Stalky a great man?"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="stalky.c1.p19"><s sid="54" id="stalky.c1.s54">"Great man," said Beetle.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="stalky.c1.p20"><s sid="55" id="stalky.c1.s55">"All the same bug-huntin's a filthy business," said McTurk.</s> <s sid="56" id="stalky.c1.s56">"How the deuce does one begin?"</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="stalky.c1.p21"><s sid="57" id="stalky.c1.s57">"This way," said Stalky, turning to some fags' lockers behind him.</s> <s sid="58" id="stalky.c1.s58">"Fags are dabs at Natural History.</s> <s sid="59" id="stalky.c1.s59">Here's young Braybrooke's botany-case."</s> <s sid="60" id="stalky.c1.s60">He flung out a tangle of decayed roots and adjusted the slide.</s> <s sid="61" id="stalky.c1.s61">"'Gives one no end of a professional air, I think.</s> <s sid="62" id="stalky.c1.s62">Here's Clay Minor's geological hammer.</s> <s sid="63" id="stalky.c1.s63">Beetle can carry that.</s> <s sid="64" id="stalky.c1.s64">Turkey, you'd better covet a butterfly-net from somewhere."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="stalky.c1.p22"><s sid="65" id="stalky.c1.s65">"I'm blowed if I do," said McTurk, simply, with immense feeling.</s> <s sid="66" id="stalky.c1.s66">"Beetle, give me the hammer."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="stalky.c1.p24"><s sid="70" id="stalky.c1.s70">"That's all right.</s> <s sid="71" id="stalky.c1.s71">It's a collapsible jamboree, too.</s> <s sid="72" id="stalky.c1.s72">Beastly luxurious dogs these fags are.</s> <s sid="73" id="stalky.c1.s73">Built like a fishin'-rod.</s> <s sid="74" id="stalky.c1.s74">'Pon my sainted Sam, but we look the complete Bug-hunters!</s> <s sid="75" id="stalky.c1.s75">Now, listen to your Uncle Stalky!</s> <s sid="76" id="stalky.c1.s76">We're goin' along the cliffs after butterflies.</s> <s sid="77" id="stalky.c1.s77">Very few chaps come there.</s> <s sid="78" id="stalky.c1.s78">We're goin' to leg it, too.</s> <s sid="79" id="stalky.c1.s79">You'd better leave your book behind."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="stalky.c1.p25"><s sid="80" id="stalky.c1.s80">"Not much!" said Beetle, firmly.</s> <s sid="81" id="stalky.c1.s81">"I'm not goin' to be done out of my fun for a lot of filthy butterflies."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="stalky.c1.p26"><s sid="82" id="stalky.c1.s82">"Then you'll sweat horrid.</s> <s sid="83" id="stalky.c1.s83">You'd better carry my Jorrocks.</s> <s sid="84" id="stalky.c1.s84">'Twon't make you any hotter."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="stalky.c1.p27"><s sid="85" id="stalky.c1.s85">They all sweated; for Stalky led them at a smart trot west away along the cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe.</s> <s sid="86" id="stalky.c1.s86">They took no heed to flying rabbits or fluttering fritillaries, and all that Turkey said of geology was utterly unquotable.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="stalky.c1.p28"><s sid="87" id="stalky.c1.s87">"Are we going to Clovelly?" he puffed at last, and they flung themselves down on the short, springy turf between the drone of the sea below and the light summer wind among the inland trees.</s> <s sid="88" id="stalky.c1.s88">They were looking into a combe half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that ran up to a fringe of brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and hollies.</s> <s sid="89" id="stalky.c1.s89">It was as though one-half the combe were filled with golden fire to the cliff's edge.</s> <s sid="90" id="stalky.c1.s90">The side nearest to them was open grass, and fairly bristled with notice-boards.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="stalky.c1.p29"><s sid="91" id="stalky.c1.s91">"Fee-rocious old cove, this," said Stalky, reading the nearest.</s> <s sid="92" id="stalky.c1.s92">"'_Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law_.</s> <s sid="93" id="stalky.c1.s93">G.

<p pid="31" id="stalky.c1.p31"><s sid="99" id="stalky.c1.s99">"Glad of that, 'cause this looks like what we wanted.</s> <s sid="100" id="stalky.c1.s100">Not straight across, Beetle, you blind lunatic!</s> <s sid="101" id="stalky.c1.s101">Anyone could spot us half a mile off.</s> <s sid="102" id="stalky.c1.s102">This way; and furl up your beastly butterfly-net."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="stalky.c1.p32"><s sid="103" id="stalky.c1.s103">Beetle disconnected the ring, thrust the net into a pocket, shut up the handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his waist.</s> <s sid="104" id="stalky.c1.s104">Stalky led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter of a mile from the sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="stalky.c1.p33"><s sid="105" id="stalky.c1.s105">"_Now_ we can get straight down through the furze, and never show up at all," said the tactician.</s> <s sid="106" id="stalky.c1.s106">"Beetle, go ahead and explore.</s> <s sid="107" id="stalky.c1.s107">Snf!</s> <s sid="108" id="stalky.c1.s108">Snf!</s> <s sid="109" id="stalky.c1.s109">Beastly stink of fox somewhere!"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="stalky.c1.p34"><s sid="110" id="stalky.c1.s110">On all fours, save when he clung to his spectacles, Beetle wormed into the gorse, and presently announced between grunts of pain that he had found a very fair fox-track.</s> <s sid="111" id="stalky.c1.s111">This was well for Beetle, since Stalky pinched him _a tergo_.</s> <s sid="112" id="stalky.c1.s112">Down that tunnel they crawled.</s> <s sid="113" id="stalky.c1.s113">It was evidently a highway for the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their inexpressible joy, ended, at the very edge of the cliff, in a few square feet of dry turf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 8. THE LAST TERM.</title>
<p pid="1" id="stalky.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="stalky.c8.s1">It was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations, and, more important still, the issue of the College paper which Beetle edited.</s> <s sid="2" id="stalky.c8.s2">He had been cajoled into that office by the blandishments of Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study law.</s> <s sid="3" id="stalky.c8.s3">Once installed, he discovered, as others have done before him, that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized.</s> <s sid="4" id="stalky.c8.s4">Stalky christened it the "Swillingford Patriot," in pious memory of Sponge--and McTurk compared the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De Quincey.</s> <s sid="5" id="stalky.c8.s5">Only the Head took an interest in the publication, and his methods were peculiar.</s> <s sid="6" id="stalky.c8.s6">He gave Beetle the run of his brown-bound, tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending nothing.</s> <s sid="7" id="stalky.c8.s7">There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and unlimited pens and paper.</s> <s sid="8" id="stalky.c8.s8">There were scores and scores of ancient dramatists; there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of Muscovite authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady and bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs--Peacock was that writer's name; there was Borrow's "Lavengro"; an odd theme, purporting to be a translation of something, called a "Ruba'iyat," which the Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of volumes of verse---Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E.</s> <s sid="9" id="stalky.c8.s9">L.; Lydia Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe's "Faust "; and--this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for three days--Ossian; "The Earthly Paradise"; "Atalanta in Calydon"; and Rossetti--to name only a few.</s> <s sid="10" id="stalky.c8.s10">Then the Head, drifting in under pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a verse and here another of these poets, opening up avenues.</s> <s sid="11" id="stalky.c8.s11">And, slow breathing, with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great men living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth; of years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find their places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as young men know one another.</s> <s sid="12" id="stalky.c8.s12">So the regular work went to the dogs, Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and declaiming against the long-ridged seas.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="stalky.c8.p2"><s sid="13" id="stalky.c8.s13">Thanks in large part to their house-master's experienced distrust, the three for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion to the rank of prefect--an office that went by merit, and carried with it the honor of the ground-ash, and liberty, under restrictions, to use it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="stalky.c8.p3"><s sid="14" id="stalky.c8.s14">"_But_," said Stalky, "come to think of it, we've done more giddy jesting with the Sixth since we've been passed over than any one else in the last seven years."</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="stalky.c8.p4"><s sid="15" id="stalky.c8.s15">He touched his neck proudly.</s> <s sid="16" id="stalky.c8.s16">It was encircled by the stiffest of stick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the Sixth.</s> <s sid="17" id="stalky.c8.s17">And the Sixth saw those collars and said no word.</s> <s sid="18" id="stalky.c8.s18">"Pussy," Abanazar, or Dick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded in five minutes or... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but brilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for their dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three.</s> <s sid="19" id="stalky.c8.s19">So they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads, instead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should, and rejoiced in patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous made-up ties on Sundays--no man rebuking.</s> <s sid="20" id="stalky.c8.s20">McTurk was going up for Cooper's Hill, and Stalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head had told them both that, unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays, they were safe.</s> <s sid="21" id="stalky.c8.s21">As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in an estimate of form.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="stalky.c8.p5"><s sid="22" id="stalky.c8.s22">He had taken Beetle aside that day and given him much good advice, not one word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study, white with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale.</s> <s sid="23" id="stalky.c8.s23">It demanded a great belief.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="stalky.c8.p11"><s sid="39" id="stalky.c8.s39">"This time five years," said McTurk.</s> </p>
