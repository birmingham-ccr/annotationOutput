<qe/><title>PREFACE. AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</title>
<p pid="1" id="tenant.c0.p1"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c0.s1">While I acknowledge the success of the present work to have been greater than I anticipated, and the praises it has elicited from a few kind critics to have been greater than it deserved, I must also admit that from some other quarters it has been censured with an asperity which I was as little prepared to expect, and which my judgment, as well as my feelings, assures me is more bitter than just.</s> <s sid="2" id="tenant.c0.s2">It is scarcely the province of an author to refute the arguments of his censors and vindicate his own productions; but I may be allowed to make here a few observations with which I would have prefaced the first edition, had I foreseen the necessity of such precautions against the misapprehensions of those who would read it with a prejudiced mind or be content to judge it by a hasty glance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c0.p2"><s sid="3" id="tenant.c0.s3">My object in writing the following pages was not simply to amuse the Reader; neither was it to gratify my own taste, nor yet to ingratiate myself with the Press and the Public:</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c0.s4">I wished to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c0.s5">But as the priceless treasure too frequently hides at the bottom of a well, it needs some courage to dive for it, especially as he that does so will be likely to incur more scorn and obloquy for the mud and water into which he has ventured to plunge, than thanks for the jewel he procures; as, in like manner, she who undertakes the cleansing of a careless bachelor's apartment will be liable to more abuse for the dust she raises than commendation for the clearance she effects.</s> <s sid="6" id="tenant.c0.s6">Let it not be imagined, however, that I consider myself competent to reform the errors and abuses of society, but only that I would fain contribute my humble quota towards so good an aim; and if I can gain the public ear at all, I would rather whisper a few wholesome truths therein than much soft nonsense.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c0.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="tenant.c0.s7">As the story of <qs/>'Agnes Grey' was accused of extravagant over-colouring in those very parts that were carefully copied from the life, with a most scrupulous avoidance of all exaggeration, so, in the present work, I find myself censured for depicting _con amore_, with 'a morbid love of the coarse, if not of the brutal,'<qe/> those scenes which, I will venture to say, have not been more painful for the most fastidious of my critics to read than they were for me to describe.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c0.s8">I may have gone too far; in which case I shall be careful not to trouble myself or my readers in the same way again; but when we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear.</s> <s sid="9" id="tenant.c0.s9">To represent a bad thing in its least offensive light is, doubtless, the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the safest?</s> <s sid="10" id="tenant.c0.s10">Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and flowers?</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c0.s11">Oh, reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of facts--this whispering, <qs/>'Peace, peace,'<qe/> when there is no peace, there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c0.p4"><s sid="12" id="tenant.c0.s12">I would not be understood to suppose that the proceedings of the unhappy scapegrace, with his few profligate companions I have here introduced, are a specimen of the common practices of society--the case is an extreme one, as I trusted none would fail to perceive; but I know that such characters do exist, and if I have warned one rash youth from following in their steps, or prevented one thoughtless girl from falling into the very natural error of my heroine, the book has not been written in vain.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c0.s13">But, at the same time, if any honest reader shall have derived more pain than pleasure from its perusal, and have closed the last volume with a disagreeable impression on his mind, I humbly crave his pardon, for such was far from my intention; and I will endeavour to do better another time, for I love to give innocent pleasure.</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c0.s14">Yet, be it understood, I shall not limit my ambition to this--or even to producing 'a perfect work of art': time and talents so spent, I should consider wasted and misapplied.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c0.s15">Such humble talents as God has given me I will endeavour to put to their greatest use; if I am able to amuse, I will try to benefit too; and when I feel it my duty to speak an unpalatable truth, with the help of God, I _will_ speak it, though it be to the prejudice of my name and to the detriment of my reader's immediate pleasure as well as my own.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c0.p5"><s sid="16" id="tenant.c0.s16">One word more, and I have done.</s> <s sid="17" id="tenant.c0.s17">Respecting the author's identity, I would have it to be distinctly understood that Acton Bell is neither Currer nor Ellis Bell, and therefore let not his faults be attributed to them.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c0.s18">As to whether the name be real or fictitious, it cannot greatly signify to those who know him only by his works.</s> <s sid="19" id="tenant.c0.s19">As little, I should think, can it matter whether the writer so designated is a man, or a woman, as one or two of my critics profess to have discovered.</s> <s sid="20" id="tenant.c0.s20">I take the imputation in good part, as a compliment to the just delineation of my female characters; and though I am bound to attribute much of the severity of my censors to this suspicion, I make no effort to refute it, because, in my own mind, I am satisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be.</s> <s sid="21" id="tenant.c0.s21">All novels are, or should be, written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="tenant.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c1.s1">You must go back with me to the autumn of 1827.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="tenant.c1.s2">My father, as you know, was a sort of gentleman farmer in --shire; and I, by his express desire, succeeded him in the same quiet occupation, not very willingly, for ambition urged me to higher aims, and self-conceit assured me that, in disregarding its voice, I was burying my talent in the earth, and hiding my light under a bushel.</s> <s sid="3" id="tenant.c1.s3">My mother had done her utmost to persuade me that I was capable of great achievements; but my father, who thought ambition was the surest road to ruin, and change but another word for destruction, would listen to no scheme for bettering either my own condition, or that of my fellow mortals.</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c1.s4">He assured me it was all rubbish, and exhorted me, with his dying breath, to continue in the good old way, to follow his steps, and those of his father before him, and let my highest ambition be to walk honestly through the world, looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, and to transmit the paternal acres to my children in, at least, as flourishing a condition as he left them to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="tenant.c1.s5"><qs/>'Well!--an honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful members of society; and if I devote my talents to the cultivation of my farm, and the improvement of agriculture in general, I shall thereby benefit, not only my own immediate connections and dependants, but, in some degree, mankind at large:--hence I shall not have lived in vain.'<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="tenant.c1.s6">With such reflections as these I was endeavouring to console myself, as I plodded home from the fields, one cold, damp, cloudy evening towards the close of October.</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c1.s7">But the gleam of a bright red fire through the parlour window had more effect in cheering my spirits, and rebuking my thankless repinings, than all the sage reflections and good resolutions I had forced my mind to frame;--for I was young then, remember--only four-and-twenty--and had not acquired half the rule over my own spirit that I now possess--trifling as that may be.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="tenant.c1.s8">However, that haven of bliss must not be entered till I had exchanged my miry boots for a clean pair of shoes, and my rough surtout for a respectable coat, and made myself generally presentable before decent society; for my mother, with all her kindness, was vastly particular on certain points.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c1.p5"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c1.s9">In ascending to my room I was met upon the stairs by a smart, pretty girl of nineteen, with a tidy, dumpy figure, a round face, bright, blooming cheeks, glossy, clustering curls, and little merry brown eyes.</s> <s sid="10" id="tenant.c1.s10">I need not tell you this was my sister Rose.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c1.s11">She is, I know, a comely matron still, and, doubtless, no less lovely--in your eyes--than on the happy day you first beheld her.</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c1.s12">Nothing told me then that she, a few years hence, would be the wife of one entirely unknown to me as yet, but destined hereafter to become a closer friend than even herself, more intimate than that unmannerly lad of seventeen, by whom I was collared in the passage, on coming down, and well-nigh jerked off my equilibrium, and who, in correction for his impudence, received a resounding whack over the sconce, which, however, sustained no serious injury from the infliction; as, besides being more than commonly thick, it was protected by a redundant shock of short, reddish curls, that my mother called auburn.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c1.p6"><s sid="13" id="tenant.c1.s13">On entering the parlour we found that honoured lady seated in her arm-chair at the fireside, working away at her knitting, according to her usual custom, when she had nothing else to do.</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c1.s14">She had swept the hearth, and made a bright blazing fire for our reception; the servant had just brought in the tea-tray; and Rose was producing the sugar-basin and tea-caddy from the cupboard in the black oak side-board, that shone like polished ebony, in the cheerful parlour twilight.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="tenant.c1.s15"><qs/>'Well! here they both are,'<qe/> cried my mother, looking round upon us without retarding the motion of her nimble fingers and glittering needles.</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c1.s16"><qs/>'Now shut the door, and come to the fire, while Rose gets the tea ready; I'm sure you must be starved;--and tell me what you've been about all day;--I like to know what my children have been about.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tenant.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="tenant.c1.s17"><qs/>'I've been breaking in the grey colt--no easy business that--directing the ploughing of the last wheat stubble--for the ploughboy has not the sense to direct himself--and carrying out a plan for the extensive and efficient draining of the low meadowlands.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tenant.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="tenant.c1.s18"><qs/>'That's my brave boy!--and Fergus, what have you been doing?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tenant.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="tenant.c1.s19"><qs/>'Badger-baiting.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tenant.c1.p11"><s sid="20" id="tenant.c1.s20">And here he proceeded to give a particular account of his sport, and the respective traits of prowess evinced by the badger and the dogs; my mother pretending to listen with deep attention, and watching his animated countenance with a degree of maternal admiration I thought highly disproportioned to its object.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tenant.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="tenant.c1.s21"><qs/>'It's time you should be doing something else, Fergus,'<qe/> said I, as soon as a momentary pause in his narration allowed me to get in a word.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tenant.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="tenant.c1.s22"><qs/>'What can I do?'<qe/><sss/> replied he; <sse/><qs/>'my mother won't let me go to sea or enter the army; and I'm determined to do nothing else--except make myself such a nuisance to you all, that you will be thankful to get rid of me on any terms.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="tenant.c1.p14"><s sid="23" id="tenant.c1.s23">Our parent soothingly stroked his stiff, short curls.</s> <s sid="24" id="tenant.c1.s24">He growled, and tried to look sulky, and then we all took our seats at the table, in obedience to the thrice-repeated summons of Rose.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tenant.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="tenant.c1.s25"><qs/>'Now take your tea,'<qe/><sss/> said she; <sse/><qs/>'and I'll tell you what I've been doing.</s> <s sid="26" id="tenant.c1.s26">I've been to call on the Wilsons; and it's a thousand pities you didn't go with me, Gilbert, for Eliza Millward was there!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="tenant.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="tenant.c1.s27"><qs/>'Well! what of her?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tenant.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="tenant.c1.s28"><qs/>'Oh, nothing!--I'm not going to tell you about her;--only that she's a nice, amusing little thing, when she is in a merry humour, and I shouldn't mind calling her--'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tenant.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="tenant.c1.s29"><qs/>'Hush, hush, my dear! your brother has no such idea!'<qe/> whispered my mother earnestly, holding up her finger.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tenant.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="tenant.c1.s30"><qs/>'Well,'<qe/><sss/> resumed Rose; <sse/><qs/>'I was going to tell you an important piece of news I heard there--I have been bursting with it ever since.</s> <s sid="31" id="tenant.c1.s31">You know it was reported a month ago, that somebody was going to take Wildfell Hall--and--what do you think?</s> <s sid="32" id="tenant.c1.s32">It has actually been inhabited above a week!--and we never knew!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tenant.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="tenant.c1.s33"><qs/>'Impossible!'<qe/> cried my mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tenant.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="tenant.c1.s34"><qs/>'Preposterous!!!'<qe/> shrieked Fergus.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tenant.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="tenant.c1.s35"><qs/>'It has indeed!--and by a single lady!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tenant.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="tenant.c1.s36"><qs/>'Good gracious, my dear!</s> <s sid="37" id="tenant.c1.s37">The place is in ruins!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tenant.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="tenant.c1.s38"><qs/>'She has had two or three rooms made habitable; and there she lives, all alone--except an old woman for a servant!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tenant.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="tenant.c1.s39"><qs/>'Oh, dear! that spoils it--I'd hoped she was a witch,'<qe/> observed Fergus, while carving his inch-thick slice of bread and butter.</s> <s sid="40" id="tenant.c1.s40"><qs/>'Nonsense, Fergus!</s> <s sid="41" id="tenant.c1.s41">But isn't it strange, mamma?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tenant.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="tenant.c1.s42"><qs/>'Strange!</s> <s sid="43" id="tenant.c1.s43">I can hardly believe it.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tenant.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="tenant.c1.s44">'But you may believe it; for Jane Wilson has seen her.</s> <s sid="45" id="tenant.c1.s45">She went with her mother, who, of course, when she heard of a stranger being in the neighbourhood, would be on pins and needles till she had seen her and got all she could out of her.</s> <s sid="46" id="tenant.c1.s46">She is called Mrs. Graham, and she is in mourning--not widow's weeds, but slightish mourning--and she is quite young, they say,--not above five or six and twenty,--but so reserved!</s> <s sid="47" id="tenant.c1.s47">They tried all they could to find out who she was and where she came from, and, all about her, but neither Mrs. Wilson, with her pertinacious and impertinent home-thrusts, nor Miss Wilson, with her skilful manoeuvring, could manage to elicit a single satisfactory answer, or even a casual remark, or chance expression calculated to allay their curiosity, or throw the faintest ray of light upon her history, circumstances, or connections.</s> <s sid="48" id="tenant.c1.s48">Moreover, she was barely civil to them, and evidently better pleased to say <qs/>'good-by,'<qe/><sss/> than <sse/><qs/>'how do you do.'<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="tenant.c1.s49">But Eliza Millward says her father intends to call upon her soon, to offer some pastoral advice, which he fears she needs, as, though she is known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week, she did not make her appearance at church on Sunday; and she--Eliza, that is--will beg to accompany him, and is sure she can succeed in wheedling something out of her--you know, Gilbert, she can do anything.</s> <s sid="50" id="tenant.c1.s50">And we should call some time, mamma; it's only proper, you know.'</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tenant.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="tenant.c1.s51"><qs/>'Of course, my dear.</s> <s sid="52" id="tenant.c1.s52">Poor thing!</s> <s sid="53" id="tenant.c1.s53">How lonely she must feel!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tenant.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="tenant.c1.s54"><qs/>'And pray, be quick about it; and mind you bring me word how much sugar she puts in her tea, and what sort of caps and aprons she wears, and all about it; for I don't know how I can live till I know,'<qe/> said Fergus, very gravely.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tenant.c1.p30"><s sid="55" id="tenant.c1.s55">But if he intended the speech to be hailed as a master-stroke of wit, he signally failed, for nobody laughed.</s> <s sid="56" id="tenant.c1.s56">However, he was not much disconcerted at that; for when he had taken a mouthful of bread and butter and was about to swallow a gulp of tea, the humour of the thing burst upon him with such irresistible force, that he was obliged to jump up from the table, and rush snorting and choking from the room; and a minute after, was heard screaming in fearful agony in the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tenant.c1.p31"><s sid="57" id="tenant.c1.s57">As for me, I was hungry, and contented myself with silently demolishing the tea, ham, and toast, while my mother and sister went on talking, and continued to discuss the apparent or non-apparent circumstances, and probable or improbable history of the mysterious lady; but I must confess that, after my brother's misadventure, I once or twice raised the cup to my lips, and put it down again without daring to taste the contents, lest I should injure my dignity by a similar explosion.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tenant.c1.p32"><s sid="58" id="tenant.c1.s58">The next day my mother and Rose hastened to pay their compliments to the fair recluse; and came back but little wiser than they went; though my mother declared she did not regret the journey, for if she had not gained much good, she flattered herself she had imparted some, and that was better: she had given some useful advice, which, she hoped, would not be thrown away; for Mrs. Graham, though she said little to any purpose, and appeared somewhat self-opinionated, seemed not incapable of reflection,--though she did not know where she had been all her life, poor thing, for she betrayed a lamentable ignorance on certain points, and had not even the sense to be ashamed of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tenant.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="tenant.c1.s59"><qs/>'On what points, mother?'<qe/> asked I.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tenant.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="tenant.c1.s60"><qs/>'On household matters, and all the little niceties of cookery, and such things, that every lady ought to be familiar with, whether she be required to make a practical use of her knowledge or not.</s> <s sid="61" id="tenant.c1.s61">I gave her some useful pieces of information, however, and several excellent receipts, the value of which she evidently could not appreciate, for she begged I would not trouble myself, as she lived in such a plain, quiet way, that she was sure she should never make use of them.</s> <s sid="62" id="tenant.c1.s62"><alt-qs/>"No matter, my dear,"<alt-qe/><alt-sss/><sss/> said I; <sse/><alt-sse/><alt-qs/>"it is what every respectable female ought to know;--and besides, though you are alone now, you will not be always so; you have been married, and probably--I might say almost certainly--will be again."<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="63" id="tenant.c1.s63"><alt-qs/>"You are mistaken there, ma'am,"<alt-qe/><alt-sss/><sss/> said she, almost haughtily; <sse/><alt-sse/><alt-qs/>"I am certain I never shall."<alt-qe/>--But I told her I knew better.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="tenant.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="tenant.c1.s64"><qs/>'Some romantic young widow, I suppose,'<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>'come there to end her days in solitude, and mourn in secret for the dear departed--but it won't last long.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="tenant.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="tenant.c1.s65"><qs/>'No, I think not,'<qe/><sss/> observed Rose; <sse/><qs/>'for she didn't seem very disconsolate after all; and she's excessively pretty--handsome rather--you must see her, Gilbert; you will call her a perfect beauty, though you could hardly pretend to discover a resemblance between her and Eliza Millward.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="tenant.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="tenant.c1.s66"><qs/>'Well, I can imagine many faces more beautiful than Eliza's, though not more charming.</s> <s sid="67" id="tenant.c1.s67">I allow she has small claims to perfection; but then, I maintain that, if she were more perfect, she would be less interesting.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="tenant.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="tenant.c1.s68"><qs/>'And so you prefer her faults to other people's perfections?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="tenant.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="tenant.c1.s69"><qs/>'Just so--saving my mother's presence.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="tenant.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="tenant.c1.s70"><qs/>'Oh, my dear Gilbert, what nonsense you talk!--I know you don't mean it; it's quite out of the question,'<qe/> said my mother, getting up, and bustling out of the room, under pretence of household business, in order to escape the contradiction that was trembling on my tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="tenant.c1.p41"><s sid="71" id="tenant.c1.s71">After that Rose favoured me with further particulars respecting Mrs. Graham.</s> <s sid="72" id="tenant.c1.s72">Her appearance, manners, and dress, and the very furniture of the room she inhabited, were all set before me, with rather more clearness and precision than I cared to see them; but, as I was not a very attentive listener, I could not repeat the description if I would.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="tenant.c1.p42"><s sid="73" id="tenant.c1.s73">The next day was Saturday; and, on Sunday, everybody wondered whether or not the fair unknown would profit by the vicar's remonstrance, and come to church.</s> <s sid="74" id="tenant.c1.s74">I confess I looked with some interest myself towards the old family pew, appertaining to Wildfell Hall, where the faded crimson cushions and lining had been unpressed and unrenewed so many years, and the grim escutcheons, with their lugubrious borders of rusty black cloth, frowned so sternly from the wall above.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="tenant.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="tenant.c1.s75">And there I beheld a tall, lady-like figure, clad in black.</s> <s sid="76" id="tenant.c1.s76">Her face was towards me, and there was something in it which, once seen, invited me to look again.</s> <s sid="77" id="tenant.c1.s77">Her hair was raven black, and disposed in long glossy ringlets, a style of coiffure rather unusual in those days, but always graceful and becoming; her complexion was clear and pale; her eyes I could not see, for, being bent upon her prayer-book, they were concealed by their drooping lids and long black lashes, but the brows above were expressive and well defined; the forehead was lofty and intellectual, the nose, a perfect aquiline and the features, in general, unexceptionable--only there was a slight hollowness about the cheeks and eyes, and the lips, though finely formed, were a little too thin, a little too firmly compressed, and had something about them that betokened, I thought, no very soft or amiable temper; and I said in my heart--<qs/>'I would rather admire you from this distance, fair lady, than be the partner of your home.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="tenant.c1.p49"><s sid="90" id="tenant.c1.s90">Her sister, Mary, was several years older, several inches taller, and of a larger, coarser build--a plain, quiet, sensible girl, who had patiently nursed their mother, through her last long, tedious illness, and been the housekeeper, and family drudge, from thence to the present time.</s> <s sid="91" id="tenant.c1.s91">She was trusted and valued by her father, loved and courted by all dogs, cats, children, and poor people, and slighted and neglected by everybody else.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="tenant.c1.p50"><s sid="92" id="tenant.c1.s92">The Reverend Michael Millward himself was a tall, ponderous elderly gentleman, who placed a shovel hat above his large, square, massive-featured face, carried a stout walking-stick in his hand, and incased his still powerful limbs in knee-breeches and gaiters,--or black silk stockings on state occasions.</s> <s sid="93" id="tenant.c1.s93">He was a man of fixed principles, strong prejudices, and regular habits, intolerant of dissent in any shape, acting under a firm conviction that his opinions were always right, and whoever differed from them must be either most deplorably ignorant, or wilfully blind.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="tenant.c1.p51" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="tenant.c1.s94">In childhood, I had always been accustomed to regard him with a feeling of reverential awe--but lately, even now, surmounted, for, though he had a fatherly kindness for the well-behaved, he was a strict disciplinarian, and had often sternly reproved our juvenile failings and peccadilloes; and moreover, in those days, whenever he called upon our parents, we had to stand up before him, and say our catechism, or repeat, <qs/>'How doth the little busy bee,'<qe/> or some other hymn, or--worse than all--be questioned about his last text, and the heads of the discourse, which we never could remember.</s> <s sid="95" id="tenant.c1.s95">Sometimes, the worthy gentleman would reprove my mother for being over-indulgent to her sons, with a reference to old Eli, or David and Absalom, which was particularly galling to her feelings; and, very highly as she respected him, and all his sayings, I once heard her exclaim, <qs/>'I wish to goodness he had a son himself!</s> <s sid="96" id="tenant.c1.s96">He wouldn't be so ready with his advice to other people then;--he'd see what it is to have a couple of boys to keep in order.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="tenant.c1.p52"><s sid="97" id="tenant.c1.s97">He had a laudable care for his own bodily health--kept very early hours, regularly took a walk before breakfast, was vastly particular about warm and dry clothing, had never been known to preach a sermon without previously swallowing a raw egg--albeit he was gifted with good lungs and a powerful voice,--and was, generally, extremely particular about what he ate and drank, though by no means abstemious, and having a mode of dietary peculiar to himself,--being a great despiser of tea and such slops, and a patron of malt liquors, bacon and eggs, ham, hung beef, and other strong meats, which agreed well enough with his digestive organs, and therefore were maintained by him to be good and wholesome for everybody, and confidently recommended to the most delicate convalescents or dyspeptics, who, if they failed to derive the promised benefit from his prescriptions, were told it was because they had not persevered, and if they complained of inconvenient results therefrom, were assured it was all fancy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="tenant.c2.s2">I think the day I last mentioned was a certain Sunday, the latest in the October of 1827.</s> <s sid="3" id="tenant.c2.s3">On the following Tuesday I was out with my dog and gun, in pursuit of such game as I could find within the territory of Linden-Car; but finding none at all, I turned my arms against the hawks and carrion crows, whose depredations, as I suspected, had deprived me of better prey.</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c2.s4">To this end I left the more frequented regions, the wooded valleys, the corn-fields, and the meadow-lands, and proceeded to mount the steep acclivity of Wildfell, the wildest and the loftiest eminence in our neighbourhood, where, as you ascend, the hedges, as well as the trees, become scanty and stunted, the former, at length, giving place to rough stone fences, partly greened over with ivy and moss, the latter to larches and Scotch fir-trees, or isolated blackthorns.</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c2.s5">The fields, being rough and stony, and wholly unfit for the plough, were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle; the soil was thin and poor: bits of grey rock here and there peeped out from the grassy hillocks; bilberry-plants and heather--relics of more savage wildness--grew under the walls; and in many of the enclosures, ragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty herbage; but these were not my property.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c2.p3"><s sid="6" id="tenant.c2.s6">Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood Wildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of dark grey stone, venerable and picturesque to look at, but doubtless, cold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and little latticed panes, its time-eaten air-holes, and its too lonely, too unsheltered situation,--only shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the Hall itself.</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c2.s7">Behind it lay a few desolate fields, and then the brown heath-clad summit of the hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate, with large balls of grey granite--similar to those which decorated the roof and gables--surmounting the gate-posts) was a garden,--once stocked with such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener's torturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give them,--now, having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed, abandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the rain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c2.s8">The close green walls of privet, that had bordered the principal walk, were two-thirds withered away, and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had lost its neck and half its body: the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway, and the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in the waters under the earth; but, to my young imagination, they presented all of them a goblinish appearance, that harmonised well with the ghostly legions and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c2.p5"><s sid="10" id="tenant.c2.s10">I had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when I came within sight of the mansion; and then, relinquishing further depredations, I sauntered on, to have a look at the old place, and see what changes had been wrought in it by its new inhabitant.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c2.s11">I did not like to go quite to the front and stare in at the gate; but I paused beside the garden wall, and looked, and saw no change--except in one wing, where the broken windows and dilapidated roof had evidently been repaired, and where a thin wreath of smoke was curling up from the stack of chimneys.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c2.p6"><s sid="12" id="tenant.c2.s12">While I thus stood, leaning on my gun, and looking up at the dark gables, sunk in an idle reverie, weaving a tissue of wayward fancies, in which old associations and the fair young hermit, now within those walls, bore a nearly equal part, I heard a slight rustling and scrambling just within the garden; and, glancing in the direction whence the sound proceeded, I beheld a tiny hand elevated above the wall: it clung to the topmost stone, and then another little hand was raised to take a firmer hold, and then appeared a small white forehead, surmounted with wreaths of light brown hair, with a pair of deep blue eyes beneath, and the upper portion of a diminutive ivory nose.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c2.p7"><s sid="13" id="tenant.c2.s13">The eyes did not notice me, but sparkled with glee on beholding Sancho, my beautiful black and white setter, that was coursing about the field with its muzzle to the ground.</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c2.s14">The little creature raised its face and called aloud to the dog.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c2.s15">The good-natured animal paused, looked up, and wagged his tail, but made no further advances.</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c2.s16">The child (a little boy, apparently about five years old) scrambled up to the top of the wall, and called again and again; but finding this of no avail, apparently made up his mind, like Mahomet, to go to the mountain, since the mountain would not come to him, and attempted to get over; but a crabbed old cherry-tree, that grew hard by, caught him by the frock in one of its crooked scraggy arms that stretched over the wall.</s> <s sid="17" id="tenant.c2.s17">In attempting to disengage himself his foot slipped, and down he tumbled--but not to the earth;--the tree still kept him suspended.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c2.s18">There was a silent struggle, and then a piercing shriek;--but, in an instant, I had dropped my gun on the grass, and caught the little fellow in my arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c4.p6"><s sid="10" id="tenant.c4.s10">Richard Wilson, Jane's younger brother, sat in a corner, apparently good-tempered, but silent and shy, desirous to escape observation, but willing enough to listen and observe: and, although somewhat out of his element, he would have been happy enough in his own quiet way, if my mother could only have let him alone; but in her mistaken kindness, she would keep persecuting him with her attentions--pressing upon him all manner of viands, under the notion that he was too bashful to help himself, and obliging him to shout across the room his monosyllabic replies to the numerous questions and observations by which she vainly attempted to draw him into conversation.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c4.p7"><s sid="11" id="tenant.c4.s11">Rose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his company but for the importunities of his sister Jane, who was most anxious to show Mr. Lawrence that she had at least one brother more gentlemanly and refined than Robert.</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c4.s12">That worthy individual she had been equally solicitous to keep away; but he affirmed that he saw no reason why he should not enjoy a crack with Markham and the old lady (my mother was not old, really), and bonny Miss Rose and the parson, as well as the best;--and he was in the right of it too.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c4.s13">So he talked common-place with my mother and Rose, and discussed parish affairs with the vicar, farming matters with me, and politics with us both.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="tenant.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c6.s1">During the next four months I did not enter Mrs. Graham's house, nor she mine; but still the ladies continued to talk about her, and still our acquaintance continued, though slowly, to advance.</s> <s sid="2" id="tenant.c6.s2">As for their talk, I paid but little attention to that (when it related to the fair hermit, I mean), and the only information I derived from it was, that one fine frosty day she had ventured to take her little boy as far as the vicarage, and that, unfortunately, nobody was at home but Miss Millward; nevertheless, she had sat a long time, and, by all accounts, they had found a good deal to say to each other, and parted with a mutual desire to meet again.</s> <s sid="3" id="tenant.c6.s3">But Mary liked children, and fond mammas like those who can duly appreciate their treasures.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c6.p2"><s sid="4" id="tenant.c6.s4">But sometimes I saw her myself, not only when she came to church, but when she was out on the hills with her son, whether taking a long, purpose-like walk, or--on special fine days--leisurely rambling over the moor or the bleak pasture-lands, surrounding the old hall, herself with a book in her hand, her son gambolling about her; and, on any of these occasions, when I caught sight of her in my solitary walks or rides, or while following my agricultural pursuits, I generally contrived to meet or overtake her, for I rather liked to see Mrs. Graham, and to talk to her, and I decidedly liked to talk to her little companion, whom, when once the ice of his shyness was fairly broken, I found to be a very amiable, intelligent, and entertaining little fellow; and we soon became excellent friends--how much to the gratification of his mamma I cannot undertake to say.</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c6.s5">I suspected at first that she was desirous of throwing cold water on this growing intimacy--to quench, as it were, the kindling flame of our friendship--but discovering, at length, in spite of her prejudice against me, that I was perfectly harmless, and even well-intentioned, and that, between myself and my dog, her son derived a great deal of pleasure from the acquaintance that he would not otherwise have known, she ceased to object, and even welcomed my coming with a smile.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c6.p3"><s sid="6" id="tenant.c6.s6">As for Arthur, he would shout his welcome from afar, and run to meet me fifty yards from his mother's side.</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c6.s7">If I happened to be on horseback he was sure to get a canter or a gallop; or, if there was one of the draught horses within an available distance, he was treated to a steady ride upon that, which served his turn almost as well; but his mother would always follow and trudge beside him--not so much, I believe, to ensure his safe conduct, as to see that I instilled no objectionable notions into his infant mind, for she was ever on the watch, and never would allow him to be taken out of her sight.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c6.s8">What pleased her best of all was to see him romping and racing with Sancho, while I walked by her side--not, I fear, for love of my company (though I sometimes deluded myself with that idea), so much as for the delight she took in seeing her son thus happily engaged in the enjoyment of those active sports so invigorating to his tender frame, yet so seldom exercised for want of playmates suited to his years: and, perhaps, her pleasure was sweetened not a little by the fact of my being with her instead of with him, and therefore incapable of doing him any injury directly or indirectly, designedly or otherwise, small thanks to her for that same.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c6.p4"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c6.s9">But sometimes, I believe, she really had some little gratification in conversing with me; and one bright February morning, during twenty minutes' stroll along the moor, she laid aside her usual asperity and reserve, and fairly entered into conversation with me, discoursing with so much eloquence and depth of thought and feeling on a subject happily coinciding with my own ideas, and looking so beautiful withal, that I went home enchanted; and on the way (morally) started to find myself thinking that, after all, it would, perhaps, be better to spend one's days with such a woman than with Eliza Millward; and then I (figuratively) blushed for my inconstancy.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c6.p5"><s sid="10" id="tenant.c6.s10">On entering the parlour I found Eliza there with Rose, and no one else.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c6.s11">The surprise was not altogether so agreeable as it ought to have been.</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c6.s12">We chatted together a long time, but I found her rather frivolous, and even a little insipid, compared with the more mature and earnest Mrs. Graham.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c6.s13">Alas, for human constancy!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c6.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="tenant.c6.s14"><qs/>'However,'<qe/><sss/> thought I, <sse/><qs/>'I ought not to marry Eliza, since my mother so strongly objects to it, and I ought not to delude the girl with the idea that I intended to do so.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c6.s15">Now, if this mood continue, I shall have less difficulty in emancipating my affections from her soft yet unrelenting sway; and, though Mrs. Graham might be equally objectionable, I may be permitted, like the doctors, to cure a greater evil by a less, for I shall not fall seriously in love with the young widow, I think, nor she with me--that's certain--but if I find a little pleasure in her society I may surely be allowed to seek it; and if the star of her divinity be bright enough to dim the lustre of Eliza's, so much the better, but I scarcely can think it.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c6.p7"><s sid="16" id="tenant.c6.s16">And thereafter I seldom suffered a fine day to pass without paying a visit to Wildfell about the time my new acquaintance usually left her hermitage; but so frequently was I baulked in my expectations of another interview, so changeable was she in her times of coming forth and in her places of resort, so transient were the occasional glimpses I was able to obtain, that I felt half inclined to think she took as much pains to avoid my company as I to seek hers; but this was too disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could conveniently be dismissed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tenant.c6.p8"><s sid="17" id="tenant.c6.s17">One calm, clear afternoon, however, in March, as I was superintending the rolling of the meadow-land, and the repairing of a hedge in the valley, I saw Mrs. Graham down by the brook, with a sketch-book in her hand, absorbed in the exercise of her favourite art, while Arthur was putting on the time with constructing dams and breakwaters in the shallow, stony stream.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c6.s18">I was rather in want of amusement, and so rare an opportunity was not to be neglected; so, leaving both meadow and hedge, I quickly repaired to the spot, but not before Sancho, who, immediately upon perceiving his young friend, scoured at full gallop the intervening space, and pounced upon him with an impetuous mirth that precipitated the child almost into the middle of the beck; but, happily, the stones preserved him from any serious wetting, while their smoothness prevented his being too much hurt to laugh at the untoward event.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tenant.c6.p9"><s sid="19" id="tenant.c6.s19">Mrs. Graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different varieties of trees in their winter nakedness, and copying, with a spirited, though delicate touch, their various ramifications.</s> <s sid="20" id="tenant.c6.s20">She did not talk much, but I stood and watched the progress of her pencil: it was a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by those fair and graceful fingers.</s> <s sid="21" id="tenant.c6.s21">But ere long their dexterity became impaired, they began to hesitate, to tremble slightly, and make false strokes, and then suddenly came to a pause, while their owner laughingly raised her face to mine, and told me that her sketch did not profit by my superintendence.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER VII.</title>
<p pid="1" id="tenant.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c7.s1">Not many days after this, on a mild sunny morning--rather soft under foot; for the last fall of snow was only just wasted away, leaving yet a thin ridge, here and there, lingering on the fresh green grass beneath the hedges; but beside them already, the young primroses were peeping from among their moist, dark foliage, and the lark above was singing of summer, and hope, and love, and every heavenly thing--I was out on the hill-side, enjoying these delights, and looking after the well-being of my young lambs and their mothers, when, on glancing round me, I beheld three persons ascending from the vale below.</s> <s sid="2" id="tenant.c7.s2">They were Eliza Millward, Fergus, and Rose; so I crossed the field to meet them; and, being told they were going to Wildfell Hall, I declared myself willing to go with them, and offering my arm to Eliza, who readily accepted it in lieu of my brother's, told the latter he might go back, for I would accompany the ladies.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="tenant.c7.s3"><qs/>'I beg your pardon!'<qe/> exclaimed he.</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c7.s4"><qs/>'It's the ladies that are accompanying me, not I them.</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c7.s5">You had all had a peep at this wonderful stranger but me, and I could endure my wretched ignorance no longer--come what would, I must be satisfied; so I begged Rose to go with me to the Hall, and introduce me to her at once.</s> <s sid="6" id="tenant.c7.s6">She swore she would not, unless Miss Eliza would go too; so I ran to the vicarage and fetched her; and we've come hooked all the way, as fond as a pair of lovers--and now you've taken her from me; and you want to deprive me of my walk and my visit besides.</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c7.s7">Go back to your fields and your cattle, you lubberly fellow; you're not fit to associate with ladies and gentlemen like us, that have nothing to do but to run snooking about to our neighbours' houses, peeping into their private corners, and scenting out their secrets, and picking holes in their coats, when we don't find them ready made to our hands--you don't understand such refined sources of enjoyment.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="tenant.c7.s8"><qs/>'Can't you both go?'<qe/> suggested Eliza, disregarding the latter half of the speech.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c7.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c7.s9"><qs/>'Yes, both, to be sure!'<qe/><sss/> cried Rose; <sse/><qs/>'the more the merrier--and I'm sure we shall want all the cheerfulness we can carry with us to that great, dark, gloomy room, with its narrow latticed windows, and its dismal old furniture--unless she shows us into her studio again.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c7.p5"><s sid="10" id="tenant.c7.s10">So we went all in a body; and the meagre old maid-servant, that opened the door, ushered us into an apartment such as Rose had described to me as the scene of her first introduction to Mrs. Graham, a tolerably spacious and lofty room, but obscurely lighted by the old-fashioned windows, the ceiling, panels, and chimney-piece of grim black oak--the latter elaborately but not very tastefully carved,--with tables and chairs to match, an old bookcase on one side of the fire-place, stocked with a motley assemblage of books, and an elderly cabinet piano on the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c7.p6"><s sid="11" id="tenant.c7.s11">The lady was seated in a stiff, high-backed arm-chair, with a small round table, containing a desk and a work-basket on one side of her, and her little boy on the other, who stood leaning his elbow on her knee, and reading to her, with wonderful fluency, from a small volume that lay in her lap; while she rested her hand on his shoulder, and abstractedly played with the long, wavy curls that fell on his ivory neck.</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c7.s12">They struck me as forming a pleasing contrast to all the surrounding objects; but of course their position was immediately changed on our entrance.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c7.s13">I could only observe the picture during the few brief seconds that Rachel held the door for our admittance.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="tenant.c7.s14">I do not think Mrs. Graham was particularly delighted to see us: there was something indescribably chilly in her quiet, calm civility; but I did not talk much to her.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c7.s15">Seating myself near the window, a little back from the circle, I called Arthur to me, and he and I and Sancho amused ourselves very pleasantly together, while the two young ladies baited his mother with small talk, and Fergus sat opposite with his legs crossed and his hands in his breeches-pockets, leaning back in his chair, and staring now up at the ceiling, now straight forward at his hostess (in a manner that made me strongly inclined to kick him out of the room), now whistling sotto voce to himself a snatch of a favourite air, now interrupting the conversation, or filling up a pause (as the case might be) with some most impertinent question or remark.</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c7.s16">At one time it was,--<qs/>'It, amazes me, Mrs. Graham, how you could choose such a dilapidated, rickety old place as this to live in.</s> <s sid="17" id="tenant.c7.s17">If you couldn't afford to occupy the whole house, and have it mended up, why couldn't you take a neat little cottage?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tenant.c7.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="tenant.c7.s21"><qs/>'But then how can you bear such a situation--your nearest neighbours two miles distant, and nobody looking in or passing by?</s> <s sid="22" id="tenant.c7.s22">Rose would go stark mad in such a place.</s> <s sid="23" id="tenant.c7.s23">She can't put on life unless she sees half a dozen fresh gowns and bonnets a day--not to speak of the faces within; but you might sit watching at these windows all day long, and never see so much as an old woman carrying her eggs to market.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tenant.c7.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="tenant.c7.s24"><qs/>'I am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief recommendations.</s> <s sid="25" id="tenant.c7.s25">I take no pleasure in watching people pass the windows; and I like to be quiet.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tenant.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="tenant.c7.s26"><qs/>'Oh! as good as to say you wish we would all of us mind our own business, and let you alone.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tenant.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="tenant.c7.s27"><qs/>'No, I dislike an extensive acquaintance; but if I have a few friends, of course I am glad to see them occasionally.</s> <s sid="28" id="tenant.c7.s28">No one can be happy in eternal solitude.</s> <s sid="29" id="tenant.c7.s29">Therefore, Mr. Fergus, if you choose to enter my house as a friend, I will make you welcome; if not, I must confess, I would rather you kept away.'<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="tenant.c7.s30">She then turned and addressed some observation to Rose or Eliza.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tenant.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="tenant.c7.s31"><qs/>'And, Mrs. Graham,'<qe/><sls/> said he again, five minutes after, <sle/><qs/>'we were disputing, as we came along, a question that you can readily decide for us, as it mainly regarded yourself--and, indeed, we often hold discussions about you; for some of us have nothing better to do than to talk about our neighbours' concerns, and we, the indigenous plants of the soil, have known each other so long, and talked each other over so often, that we are quite sick of that game; so that a stranger coming amongst us makes an invaluable addition to our exhausted sources of amusement.</s> <s sid="32" id="tenant.c7.s32">Well, the question, or questions, you are requested to solve--'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tenant.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="tenant.c7.s39"><qs/>'Except this--'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tenant.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="tenant.c7.s40"><qs/>'No, not one more!'<qe/> laughed she, and, instantly quitting her seat, she sought refuge at the window by which I was seated, and, in very desperation, to escape my brother's persecutions, endeavoured to draw me into conversation.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tenant.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="tenant.c7.s41"><qs/>'Mr. Markham,'<qe/><sls/> said she, her rapid utterance and heightened colour too plainly evincing her disquietude, <sle/><qs/>'have you forgotten the fine sea-view we were speaking of some time ago?</s> <s sid="42" id="tenant.c7.s42">I think I must trouble you, now, to tell me the nearest way to it; for if this beautiful weather continue, I shall, perhaps, be able to walk there, and take my sketch; I have exhausted every other subject for painting; and I long to see it.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tenant.c7.p20"><s sid="43" id="tenant.c7.s43">I was about to comply with her request, but Rose would not suffer me to proceed.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tenant.c7.p21" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="tenant.c7.s44"><qs/>'Oh, don't tell her, Gilbert!'<qe/><sss/> cried she; <sse/><qs/>'she shall go with us.</s> <s sid="45" id="tenant.c7.s45">It's -- Bay you are thinking about, I suppose, Mrs. Graham?</s> <s sid="46" id="tenant.c7.s46">It is a very long walk, too far for you, and out of the question for Arthur.</s> <s sid="47" id="tenant.c7.s47">But we were thinking about making a picnic to see it some fine day; and, if you will wait till the settled fine weather comes, I'm sure we shall all be delighted to have you amongst us.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tenant.c7.p22"><s sid="48" id="tenant.c7.s48">Poor Mrs. Graham looked dismayed, and attempted to make excuses, but Rose, either compassionating her lonely life, or anxious to cultivate her acquaintance, was determined to have her; and every objection was overruled.</s> <s sid="49" id="tenant.c7.s49">She was told it would only be a small party, and all friends, and that the best view of all was from -- Cliffs, full five miles distant.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tenant.c7.p23" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="tenant.c7.s50"><qs/>'Just a nice walk for the gentlemen,'<qe/><sss/> continued Rose; <sse/><qs/>'but the ladies will drive and walk by turns; for we shall have our pony-carriage, which will be plenty large enough to contain little Arthur and three ladies, together with your sketching apparatus, and our provisions.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tenant.c7.p24"><s sid="51" id="tenant.c7.s51">So the proposal was finally acceded to; and, after some further discussion respecting the time and manner of the projected excursion, we rose, and took our leave.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tenant.c7.p25"><s sid="52" id="tenant.c7.s52">But this was only March: a cold, wet April, and two weeks of May passed over before we could venture forth on our expedition with the reasonable hope of obtaining that pleasure we sought in pleasant prospects, cheerful society, fresh air, good cheer and exercise, without the alloy of bad roads, cold winds, or threatening clouds.</s> <s sid="53" id="tenant.c7.s53">Then, on a glorious morning, we gathered our forces and set forth.</s> <s sid="54" id="tenant.c7.s54">The company consisted of Mrs. and Master Graham, Mary and Eliza Millward, Jane and Richard Wilson, and Rose, Fergus, and Gilbert Markham.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tenant.c7.p26"><s sid="55" id="tenant.c7.s55">Mr. Lawrence had been invited to join us, but, for some reason best known to himself, had refused to give us his company.</s> <s sid="56" id="tenant.c7.s56">I had solicited the favour myself.</s> <s sid="57" id="tenant.c7.s57">When I did so, he hesitated, and asked who were going.</s> <s sid="58" id="tenant.c7.s58">Upon my naming Miss Wilson among the rest, he seemed half inclined to go, but when I mentioned Mrs. Graham, thinking it might be a further inducement, it appeared to have a contrary effect, and he declined it altogether, and, to confess the truth, the decision was not displeasing to me, though I could scarcely tell you why.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tenant.c7.p27"><s sid="59" id="tenant.c7.s59">It was about midday when we reached the place of our destination.</s> <s sid="60" id="tenant.c7.s60">Mrs. Graham walked all the way to the cliffs; and little Arthur walked the greater part of it too; for he was now much more hardy and active than when he first entered the neighbourhood, and he did not like being in the carriage with strangers, while all his four friends, mamma, and Sancho, and Mr. Markham, and Miss Millward, were on foot, journeying far behind, or passing through distant fields and lanes.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tenant.c7.p28"><s sid="61" id="tenant.c7.s61">I have a very pleasant recollection of that walk, along the hard, white, sunny road, shaded here and there with bright green trees, and adorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious fragrance; or through pleasant fields and lanes, all glorious in the sweet flowers and brilliant verdure of delightful May.</s> <s sid="62" id="tenant.c7.s62">It was true, Eliza was not beside me; but she was with her friends in the pony-carriage, as happy, I trusted, as I was; and even when we pedestrians, having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the fields, beheld the little carriage far away, disappearing amid the green, embowering trees, I did not hate those trees for snatching the dear little bonnet and shawl from my sight, nor did I feel that all those intervening objects lay between my happiness and me; for, to confess the truth, I was too happy in the company of Mrs. Graham to regret the absence of Eliza Millward.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tenant.c7.p29"><s sid="63" id="tenant.c7.s63">The former, it is true, was most provokingly unsociable at first--seemingly bent upon talking to no one but Mary Millward and Arthur.</s> <s sid="64" id="tenant.c7.s64">She and Mary journeyed along together, generally with the child between them;--but where the road permitted, I always walked on the other side of her, Richard Wilson taking the other side of Miss Millward, and Fergus roving here and there according to his fancy; and, after a while, she became more friendly, and at length I succeeded in securing her attention almost entirely to myself--and then I was happy indeed; for whenever she did condescend to converse, I liked to listen.</s> <s sid="65" id="tenant.c7.s65">Where her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme good sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where they differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal or defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that piqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or looks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me the more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed her, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in her eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tenant.c7.p30"><s sid="66" id="tenant.c7.s66">At length our walk was ended.</s> <s sid="67" id="tenant.c7.s67">The increasing height and boldness of the hills had for some time intercepted the prospect; but, on gaining the summit of a steep acclivity, and looking downward, an opening lay before us--and the blue sea burst upon our sight!--deep violet blue--not deadly calm, but covered with glinting breakers--diminutive white specks twinkling on its bosom, and scarcely to be distinguished, by the keenest vision, from the little seamews that sported above, their white wings glittering in the sunshine: only one or two vessels were visible, and those were far away.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tenant.c7.p31"><s sid="68" id="tenant.c7.s68">I looked at my companion to see what she thought of this glorious scene.</s> <s sid="69" id="tenant.c7.s69">She said nothing: but she stood still, and fixed her eyes upon it with a gaze that assured me she was not disappointed.</s> <s sid="70" id="tenant.c7.s70">She had very fine eyes, by-the-by--I don't know whether I have told you before, but they were full of soul, large, clear, and nearly black--not brown, but very dark grey.</s> <s sid="71" id="tenant.c7.s71">A cool, reviving breeze blew from the sea--soft, pure, salubrious: it waved her drooping ringlets, and imparted a livelier colour to her usually too pallid lip and cheek.</s> <s sid="72" id="tenant.c7.s72">She felt its exhilarating influence, and so did I--I felt it tingling through my frame, but dared not give way to it while she remained so quiet.</s> <s sid="73" id="tenant.c7.s73">There was an aspect of subdued exhilaration in her face, that kindled into almost a smile of exalted, glad intelligence as her eye met mine.</s> <s sid="74" id="tenant.c7.s74">Never had she looked so lovely: never had my heart so warmly cleaved to her as now.</s> <s sid="75" id="tenant.c7.s75">Had we been left two minutes longer standing there alone, I cannot answer for the consequences.</s> <s sid="76" id="tenant.c7.s76">Happily for my discretion, perhaps for my enjoyment during the remainder of the day, we were speedily summoned to the repast--a very respectable collation, which Rose, assisted by Miss Wilson and Eliza, who, having shared her seat in the carriage, had arrived with her a little before the rest, had set out upon an elevated platform overlooking the sea, and sheltered from the hot sun by a shelving rock and overhanging trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tenant.c7.p32"><s sid="77" id="tenant.c7.s77">Mrs. Graham seated herself at a distance from me.</s> <s sid="78" id="tenant.c7.s78">Eliza was my nearest neighbour.</s> <s sid="79" id="tenant.c7.s79">She exerted herself to be agreeable, in her gentle, unobtrusive way, and was, no doubt, as fascinating and charming as ever, if I could only have felt it.</s> <s sid="80" id="tenant.c7.s80">But soon my heart began to warm towards her once again; and we were all very merry and happy together--as far as I could see--throughout the protracted social meal.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tenant.c7.p33"><s sid="81" id="tenant.c7.s81">When that was over, Rose summoned Fergus to help her to gather up the fragments, and the knives, dishes, &amp;c., and restore them to the baskets; and Mrs. Graham took her camp-stool and drawing materials; and having begged Miss Millward to take charge of her precious son, and strictly enjoined him not to wander from his new guardian's side, she left us and proceeded along the steep, stony hill, to a loftier, more precipitous eminence at some distance, whence a still finer prospect was to be had, where she preferred taking her sketch, though some of the ladies told her it was a frightful place, and advised her not to attempt it.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tenant.c7.p34"><s sid="82" id="tenant.c7.s82">When she was gone, I felt as if there was to be no more fun--though it is difficult to say what she had contributed to the hilarity of the party.</s> <s sid="83" id="tenant.c7.s83">No jests, and little laughter, had escaped her lips; but her smile had animated my mirth; a keen observation or a cheerful word from her had insensibly sharpened my wits, and thrown an interest over all that was done and said by the rest.</s> <s sid="84" id="tenant.c7.s84">Even my conversation with Eliza had been enlivened by her presence, though I knew it not; and now that she was gone, Eliza's playful nonsense ceased to amuse me--nay, grew wearisome to my soul, and I grew weary of amusing her:</s> <s sid="85" id="tenant.c7.s85">I felt myself drawn by an irresistible attraction to that distant point where the fair artist sat and plied her solitary task--and not long did I attempt to resist it: while my little neighbour was exchanging a few words with Miss Wilson, I rose and cannily slipped away.</s> <s sid="86" id="tenant.c7.s86">A few rapid strides, and a little active clambering, soon brought me to the place where she was seated--a narrow ledge of rock at the very verge of the cliff, which descended with a steep, precipitous slant, quite down to the rocky shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="tenant.c24.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c24.s1">March 25th.--Arthur is getting tired--not of me, I trust, but of the idle, quiet life he leads--and no wonder, for he has so few sources of amusement: he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting magazines; and when he sees me occupied with a book, he won't let me rest till I close it.</s> <s sid="2" id="tenant.c24.s2">In fine weather he generally manages to get through the time pretty well, but on rainy days, of which we have had a good many of late, it is quite painful to witness his ennui.</s> <s sid="3" id="tenant.c24.s3">I do all I can to amuse him, but it is impossible to get him to feel interested in what I most like to talk about, while, on the other hand, he likes to talk about things that cannot interest me--or even that annoy me--and these please him--the most of all: for his favourite amusement is to sit or loll beside me on the sofa, and tell me stories of his former amours, always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl or the cozening of some unsuspecting husband; and when I express my horror and indignation, he lays it all to the charge of jealousy, and laughs till the tears run down his cheeks.</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c24.s4">I used to fly into passions or melt into tears at first, but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to my anger and agitation, I have since endeavoured to suppress my feelings and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt; but still he reads the inward struggle in my face, and misconstrues my bitterness of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded jealousy; and when he has sufficiently diverted himself with that, or fears my displeasure will become too serious for his comfort, he tries to kiss and soothe me into smiles again--never were his caresses so little welcome as then!</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c24.s5">This is double selfishness displayed to me and to the victims of his former love.</s> <s sid="6" id="tenant.c24.s6">There are times when, with a momentary pang--a flash of wild dismay, I ask myself, <qs/>'Helen, what have you done?'<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c24.s7">But I rebuke the inward questioner, and repel the obtrusive thoughts that crowd upon me; for were he ten times as sensual and impenetrable to good and lofty thoughts, I well know I have no right to complain.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c24.s8">And I don't and won't complain.</s> <s sid="9" id="tenant.c24.s9">I do and will love him still; and I do not and will not regret that I have linked my fate with his.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c24.p2"><s sid="10" id="tenant.c24.s10">April 4th.--We have had a downright quarrel.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c24.s11">The particulars are as follows:</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c24.s12">Arthur had told me, at different intervals, the whole story of his intrigue with Lady F--, which I would not believe before.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c24.s13">It was some consolation, however, to find that in this instance the lady had been more to blame than he, for he was very young at the time, and she had decidedly made the first advances, if what he said was true.</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c24.s14">I hated her for it, for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to his corruption; and when he was beginning to talk about her the other day, I begged he would not mention her, for I detested the very sound of her name.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c24.p3" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="tenant.c24.s15"><qs/>'Not because you loved her, Arthur, mind, but because she injured you and deceived her husband, and was altogether a very abominable woman, whom you ought to be ashamed to mention.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c24.p4"><s sid="16" id="tenant.c24.s16">But he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband, whom it was impossible to love.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c24.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="tenant.c24.s17"><qs/>'Then why did she marry him?'<qe/> said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c24.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="tenant.c24.s18"><qs/>'For his money,'<qe/> was the reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c24.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="tenant.c24.s19"><qs/>'Then that was another crime, and her solemn promise to love and honour him was another, that only increased the enormity of the last.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tenant.c24.p8" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="tenant.c24.s20"><qs/>'You are too severe upon the poor lady,'<qe/> laughed he.</s> <s sid="21" id="tenant.c24.s21"><qs/>'But never mind, Helen, I don't care for her now; and I never loved any of them half as much as I do you, so you needn't fear to be forsaken like them.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tenant.c24.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="tenant.c24.s22"><qs/>'If you had told me these things before, Arthur, I never should have given you the chance.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tenant.c24.p11" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="tenant.c24.s24"><qs/>'Most certainly not!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tenant.c24.p12"><s sid="25" id="tenant.c24.s25">He laughed incredulously.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tenant.c24.p13" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="tenant.c24.s26"><qs/>'I wish I could convince you of it now!'<qe/> cried I, starting up from beside him: and for the first time in my life, and I hope the last, I wished I had not married him.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="tenant.c24.p14" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="tenant.c24.s27"><qs/>'Helen,'<qe/><sss/> said he, more gravely, <sse/><qs/>'do you know that if I believed you now I should be very angry? but thank heaven I don't.</s> <s sid="28" id="tenant.c24.s28">Though you stand there with your white face and flashing eyes, looking at me like a very tigress, I know the heart within you perhaps a trifle better than you know it yourself.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tenant.c24.p15"><s sid="29" id="tenant.c24.s29">Without another word I left the room and locked myself up in my own chamber.</s> <s sid="30" id="tenant.c24.s30">In about half an hour he came to the door, and first he tried the handle, then he knocked.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="tenant.c24.p16" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="tenant.c24.s31"><qs/>'Won't you let me in, Helen?'<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="32" id="tenant.c24.s32"><qs/>'No; you have displeased me,'<qe/><sss/> I replied, <sse/><qs/>'and I don't want to see your face or hear your voice again till the morning.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tenant.c24.p17"><s sid="33" id="tenant.c24.s33">He paused a moment as if dumfounded or uncertain how to answer such a speech, and then turned and walked away.</s> <s sid="34" id="tenant.c24.s34">This was only an hour after dinner:</s> <s sid="35" id="tenant.c24.s35">I knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening; and this considerably softened my resentment, though it did not make me relent.</s> <s sid="36" id="tenant.c24.s36">I was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave, and I could live without him if I chose; and I sat down and wrote a long letter to my aunt, of course telling her nothing of all this.</s> <s sid="37" id="tenant.c24.s37">Soon after ten o'clock I heard him come up again, but he passed my door and went straight to his own dressing-room, where he shut himself in for the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tenant.c24.p18"><s sid="38" id="tenant.c24.s38">I was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning, and not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfast-room with a careless smile.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tenant.c24.p19" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="tenant.c24.s39"><qs/>'Are you cross still, Helen?'<qe/> said he, approaching as if to salute me.</s> <s sid="40" id="tenant.c24.s40">I coldly turned to the table, and began to pour out the coffee, observing that he was rather late.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tenant.c24.p20" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="tenant.c24.s41">He uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window, where he stood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen grey clouds, streaming rain, soaking lawn, and dripping leafless trees, and muttering execrations on the weather, and then sat down to breakfast.</s> <s sid="42" id="tenant.c24.s42">While taking his coffee he muttered it was <qs/>'d--d cold.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tenant.c24.p21" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="tenant.c24.s43"><qs/>'You should not have left it so long,'<qe/> said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tenant.c24.p22"><s sid="44" id="tenant.c24.s44">He made no answer, and the meal was concluded in silence.</s> <s sid="45" id="tenant.c24.s45">It was a relief to both when the letter-bag was brought in.</s> <s sid="46" id="tenant.c24.s46">It contained upon examination a newspaper and one or two letters for him, and a couple of letters for me, which he tossed across the table without a remark.</s> <s sid="47" id="tenant.c24.s47">One was from my brother, the other from Milicent Hargrave, who is now in London with her mother.</s> <s sid="48" id="tenant.c24.s48">His, I think, were business letters, and apparently not much to his mind, for he crushed them into his pocket with some muttered expletives that I should have reproved him for at any other time.</s> <s sid="49" id="tenant.c24.s49">The paper he set before him, and pretended to be deeply absorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast, and a considerable time after.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tenant.c24.p23"><s sid="50" id="tenant.c24.s50">The reading and answering of my letters, and the direction of household concerns, afforded me ample employment for the morning: after lunch I got my drawing, and from dinner till bed-time I read.</s> <s sid="51" id="tenant.c24.s51">Meanwhile, poor Arthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his time.</s> <s sid="52" id="tenant.c24.s52">He wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as I did.</s> <s sid="53" id="tenant.c24.s53">Had the weather at all permitted, he would doubtless have ordered his horse and set off to some distant region, no matter where, immediately after breakfast, and not returned till night: had there been a lady anywhere within reach, of any age between fifteen and forty-five, he would have sought revenge and found employment in getting up, or trying to get up, a desperate flirtation with her; but being, to my private satisfaction, entirely cut off from both these sources of diversion, his sufferings were truly deplorable.</s> <s sid="54" id="tenant.c24.s54">When he had done yawning over his paper and scribbling short answers to his shorter letters, he spent the remainder of the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from room to room, watching the clouds, cursing the rain, alternately petting and teasing and abusing his dogs, sometimes lounging on the sofa with a book that he could not force himself to read, and very often fixedly gazing at me when he thought I did not perceive it, with the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears, or some tokens of remorseful anguish in my face.</s> <s sid="55" id="tenant.c24.s55">But I managed to preserve an undisturbed though grave serenity throughout the day.</s> <s sid="56" id="tenant.c24.s56">I was not really angry:</s> <s sid="57" id="tenant.c24.s57">I felt for him all the time, and longed to be reconciled; but I determined he should make the first advances, or at least show some signs of an humble and contrite spirit first; for, if I began, it would only minister to his self-conceit, increase his arrogance, and quite destroy the lesson I wanted to give him.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tenant.c24.p24"><s sid="58" id="tenant.c24.s58">He made a long stay in the dining-room after dinner, and, I fear, took an unusual quantity of wine, but not enough to loosen his tongue: for when he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book, too busy to lift my head on his entrance, he merely murmured an expression of suppressed disapprobation, and, shutting the door with a bang, went and stretched himself at full length on the sofa, and composed himself to sleep.</s> <s sid="59" id="tenant.c24.s59">But his favourite cocker, Dash, that had been lying at my feet, took the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face.</s> <s sid="60" id="tenant.c24.s60">He struck it off with a smart blow, and the poor dog squeaked and ran cowering back to me.</s> <s sid="61" id="tenant.c24.s61">When he woke up, about half an hour after, he called it to him again, but Dash only looked sheepish and wagged the tip of his tail.</s> <s sid="62" id="tenant.c24.s62">He called again more sharply, but Dash only clung the closer to me, and licked my hand, as if imploring protection.</s> <s sid="63" id="tenant.c24.s63">Enraged at this, his master snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head.</s> <s sid="64" id="tenant.c24.s64">The poor dog set up a piteous outcry, and ran to the door.</s> <s sid="65" id="tenant.c24.s65">I let him out, and then quietly took up the book.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tenant.c24.p25" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="tenant.c24.s66"><qs/>'Give that book to me,'<qe/> said Arthur, in no very courteous tone.</s> <s sid="67" id="tenant.c24.s67">I gave it to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tenant.c24.p26" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="tenant.c24.s68"><qs/>'Why did you let the dog out?'<qe/><sss/> he asked; <sse/><qs/>'you knew I wanted him.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tenant.c24.p27" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="tenant.c24.s69"><qs/>'By what token?'<qe/></s> <s sid="70" id="tenant.c24.s70">I replied; <qs/>'by your throwing the book at him? but perhaps it was intended for me?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tenant.c24.p28" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="tenant.c24.s71"><qs/>'No; but I see you've got a taste of it,'<qe/> said he, looking at my hand, that had also been struck, and was rather severely grazed.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tenant.c24.p29" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="tenant.c24.s72">I returned to my reading, and he endeavoured to occupy himself in the same manner; but in a little while, after several portentous yawns, he pronounced his book to be <qs/>'cursed trash,'<qe/> and threw it on the table.</s> <s sid="73" id="tenant.c24.s73">Then followed eight or ten minutes of silence, during the greater part of which, I believe, he was staring at me.</s> <s sid="74" id="tenant.c24.s74">At last his patience was tired out.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tenant.c24.p30" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="tenant.c24.s75"><qs/>'What is that book, Helen?'<qe/> he exclaimed.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tenant.c24.p31"><s sid="76" id="tenant.c24.s76">I told him.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tenant.c24.p32" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="tenant.c24.s77"><qs/>'Is it interesting?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tenant.c24.p33" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="tenant.c24.s78"><qs/>'Yes, very.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tenant.c24.p34"><s sid="79" id="tenant.c24.s79">I went on reading, or pretending to read, at least--I cannot say there was much communication between my eyes and my brain; for, while the former ran over the pages, the latter was earnestly wondering when Arthur would speak next, and what he would say, and what I should answer.</s> <s sid="80" id="tenant.c24.s80">But he did not speak again till I rose to make the tea, and then it was only to say he should not take any.</s> <s sid="81" id="tenant.c24.s81">He continued lounging on the sofa, and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch and at me, till bed-time, when I rose, and took my candle and retired.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="tenant.c24.p35" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="tenant.c24.s82"><qs/>'Helen!'<qe/> cried he, the moment I had left the room.</s> <s sid="83" id="tenant.c24.s83">I turned back, and stood awaiting his commands.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="tenant.c24.p36" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="tenant.c24.s84"><qs/>'What do you want, Arthur?'<qe/></s> <s sid="85" id="tenant.c24.s85">I said at length.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="tenant.c24.p37" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="tenant.c24.s86"><qs/>'Nothing,'<qe/> replied he.</s> <s sid="87" id="tenant.c24.s87"><qs/>'Go!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="tenant.c24.p38" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="tenant.c24.s88">I went, but hearing him mutter something as I was closing the door, I turned again.</s> <s sid="89" id="tenant.c24.s89">It sounded very like <qs/>'confounded slut,'<qe/> but I was quite willing it should be something else.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="tenant.c24.p39" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="tenant.c24.s90"><qs/>'Were you speaking, Arthur?'<qe/></s> <s sid="91" id="tenant.c24.s91">I asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="tenant.c24.p40" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="tenant.c24.s92"><qs/>'No,'<qe/> was the answer, and I shut the door and departed.</s> <s sid="93" id="tenant.c24.s93">I saw nothing more of him till the following morning at breakfast, when he came down a full hour after the usual time.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="tenant.c24.p41" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="tenant.c24.s94"><qs/>'You're very late,'<qe/> was my morning's salutation.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="tenant.c24.p42" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="tenant.c24.s95"><qs/>'You needn't have waited for me,'<qe/> was his; and he walked up to the window again.</s> <s sid="96" id="tenant.c24.s96">It was just such weather as yesterday.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="tenant.c24.p43" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="tenant.c24.s97"><qs/>'Oh, this confounded rain!'<qe/> he muttered.</s> <s sid="98" id="tenant.c24.s98">But, after studiously regarding it for a minute or two, a bright idea, seemed to strike him, for he suddenly exclaimed, <qs/>'But I know what I'll do!'<qe/> and then returned and took his seat at the table.</s> <s sid="99" id="tenant.c24.s99">The letter-bag was already there, waiting to be opened.</s> <s sid="100" id="tenant.c24.s100">He unlocked it and examined the contents, but said nothing about them.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="tenant.c24.p49"><s sid="107" id="tenant.c24.s107">I rose and withdrew to the next room, wondering if we were to have another such miserable day as yesterday, and wishing intensely for an end of these mutually inflicted torments.</s> <s sid="108" id="tenant.c24.s108">Shortly after I heard him ring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as if he meditated a long journey.</s> <s sid="109" id="tenant.c24.s109">He then sent for the coachman, and I heard something about the carriage and the horses, and London, and seven o'clock to-morrow morning, that startled and disturbed me not a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c26.p6"><s sid="26" id="tenant.c26.s26">Mrs. Hargrave's anxiety to make good matches for her daughters is partly the cause, and partly the result, of these errors: by making a figure in the world, and showing them off to advantage, she hopes to obtain better chances for them; and by thus living beyond her legitimate means, and lavishing so much on their brother, she renders them portionless, and makes them burdens on her hands.</s> <s sid="27" id="tenant.c26.s27">Poor Milicent, I fear, has already fallen a sacrifice to the manoeuvrings of this mistaken mother, who congratulates herself on having so satisfactorily discharged her maternal duty, and hopes to do as well for Esther.</s> <s sid="28" id="tenant.c26.s28">But Esther is a child as yet, a little merry romp of fourteen: as honest-hearted, and as guileless and simple as her sister, but with a fearless spirit of her own, that I fancy her mother will find some difficulty in bending to her purposes.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="tenant.c37.p1"><s sid="1" id="tenant.c37.s1">December 20th, 1825.--Another year is past; and I am weary of this life.</s> <s sid="2" id="tenant.c37.s2">And yet I cannot wish to leave it: whatever afflictions assail me here, I cannot wish to go and leave my darling in this dark and wicked world alone, without a friend to guide him through its weary mazes, to warn him of its thousand snares, and guard him from the perils that beset him on every hand.</s> <s sid="3" id="tenant.c37.s3">I am not well fitted to be his only companion, I know; but there is no other to supply my place.</s> <s sid="4" id="tenant.c37.s4">I am too grave to minister to his amusements and enter into his infantile sports as a nurse or a mother ought to do, and often his bursts of gleeful merriment trouble and alarm me; I see in them his father's spirit and temperament, and I tremble for the consequences; and too often damp the innocent mirth I ought to share.</s> <s sid="5" id="tenant.c37.s5">That father, on the contrary, has no weight of sadness on his mind; is troubled with no fears, no scruples concerning his son's future welfare; and at evenings especially, the times when the child sees him the most and the oftenest, he is always particularly jocund and open-hearted: ready to laugh and to jest with anything or anybody but me, and I am particularly silent and sad: therefore, of course, the child dotes upon his seemingly joyous amusing, ever-indulgent papa, and will at any time gladly exchange my company for his.</s> <s sid="6" id="tenant.c37.s6">This disturbs me greatly; not so much for the sake of my son's affection (though I do prize that highly, and though I feel it is my right, and know I have done much to earn it) as for that influence over him which, for his own advantage, I would strive to purchase and retain, and which for very spite his father delights to rob me of, and, from motives of mere idle egotism, is pleased to win to himself; making no use of it but to torment me and ruin the child.</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c37.s7">My only consolation is, that he spends comparatively little of his time at home, and, during the months he passes in London or elsewhere, I have a chance of recovering the ground I had lost, and overcoming with good the evil he has wrought by his wilful mismanagement.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c37.s8">But then it is a bitter trial to behold him, on his return, doing his utmost to subvert my labours and transform my innocent, affectionate, tractable darling into a selfish, disobedient, and mischievous boy; thereby preparing the soil for those vices he has so successfully cultivated in his own perverted nature.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c37.p2"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c37.s9">Happily, there were none of Arthur's 'friends' invited to Grassdale last autumn: he took himself off to visit some of them instead.</s> <s sid="10" id="tenant.c37.s10">I wish he would always do so, and I wish his friends were numerous and loving enough to keep him amongst them all the year round.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c37.s11">Mr. Hargrave, considerably to my annoyance, did not go with him; but I think I have done with that gentleman at last.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c37.p3"><s sid="12" id="tenant.c37.s12">For seven or eight months he behaved so remarkably well, and managed so skilfully too, that I was almost completely off my guard, and was really beginning to look upon him as a friend, and even to treat him as such, with certain prudent restrictions (which I deemed scarcely necessary); when, presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness, he thought he might venture to overstep the bounds of decent moderation and propriety that had so long restrained him.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c37.s13">It was on a pleasant evening at the close of May:</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c37.s14">I was wandering in the park, and he, on seeing me there as he rode past, made bold to enter and approach me, dismounting and leaving his horse at the gate.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c37.s15">This was the first time he had ventured to come within its inclosure since I had been left alone, without the sanction of his mother's or sister's company, or at least the excuse of a message from them.</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c37.s16">But he managed to appear so calm and easy, so respectful and self-possessed in his friendliness, that, though a little surprised, I was neither alarmed nor offended at the unusual liberty, and he walked with me under the ash-trees and by the water-side, and talked, with considerable animation, good taste, and intelligence, on many subjects, before I began to think about getting rid of him.</s> <s sid="17" id="tenant.c37.s17">Then, after a pause, during which we both stood gazing on the calm, blue water--I revolving in my mind the best means of politely dismissing my companion, he, no doubt, pondering other matters equally alien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his senses,--he suddenly electrified me by beginning, in a peculiar tone, low, soft, but perfectly distinct, to pour forth the most unequivocal expressions of earnest and passionate love; pleading his cause with all the bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c37.s18">But I cut short his appeal, and repulsed him so determinately, so decidedly, and with such a mixture of scornful indignation, tempered with cool, dispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind, that he withdrew, astonished, mortified, and discomforted; and, a few days after, I heard that he had departed for London.</s> <s sid="19" id="tenant.c37.s19">He returned, however, in eight or nine weeks, and did not entirely keep aloof from me, but comported himself in so remarkable a manner that his quick-sighted sister could not fail to notice the change.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c37.p4" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="tenant.c37.s20"><qs/>'What have you done to Walter, Mrs. Huntingdon?'<qe/> said she one morning, when I had called at the Grove, and he had just left the room after exchanging a few words of the coldest civility.</s> <s sid="21" id="tenant.c37.s21"><qs/>'He has been so extremely ceremonious and stately of late, I can't imagine what it is all about, unless you have desperately offended him.</s> <s sid="22" id="tenant.c37.s22">Tell me what it is, that I may be your mediator, and make you friends again.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tenant.c37.p12" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="tenant.c37.s34"><qs/>'Esther, how can you be so rude!'<qe/> cried Mrs. Hargrave, who was seated gravely knitting in her easy-chair.</s> <s sid="35" id="tenant.c37.s35"><qs/>'Surely, you never will learn to conduct yourself like a lady!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tenant.c37.p13" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="tenant.c37.s36"><qs/>'Well, mamma, you said yourself--'<qe/>  But the young lady was silenced by the uplifted finger of her mamma, accompanied with a very stern shake of the head.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tenant.c37.p18" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="tenant.c37.s42"><qs/>'My brother's compliments, Mrs. Huntingdon, and he hopes you and he will come to a better understanding by-and-by.</s> <s sid="43" id="tenant.c37.s43">Will that do, Walter?'<qe/><sls/> added the saucy girl, turning to him and putting her arm round his neck, as he stood leaning upon the sill of the window--<sle/><qs/>'or should I have said that you are sorry you were so touchy? or that you hope she will pardon your offence?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tenant.c37.p19" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="tenant.c37.s44"><qs/>'You silly girl! you don't know what you are talking about,'<qe/> replied he gravely.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tenant.c37.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="tenant.c37.s45"><qs/>'Indeed I don't: for I'm quite in the dark!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tenant.c37.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="tenant.c37.s46"><qs/>'Now, Esther,'<qe/><sls/> interposed Mrs. Hargrave, who, if equally benighted on the subject of our estrangement, saw at least that her daughter was behaving very improperly, <sle/><qs/>'I must insist upon your leaving the room!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tenant.c37.p22" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="tenant.c37.s47"><qs/>'Pray don't, Mrs. Hargrave, for I'm going to leave it myself,'<qe/> said I, and immediately made my adieux.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tenant.c37.p23"><s sid="48" id="tenant.c37.s48">About a week after Mr. Hargrave brought his sister to see me.</s> <s sid="49" id="tenant.c37.s49">He conducted himself, at first, with his usual cold, distant, half-stately, half-melancholy, altogether injured air; but Esther made no remark upon it this time: she had evidently been schooled into better manners.</s> <s sid="50" id="tenant.c37.s50">She talked to me, and laughed and romped with little Arthur, her loved and loving playmate.</s> <s sid="51" id="tenant.c37.s51">He, somewhat to my discomfort, enticed her from the room to have a run in the hall, and thence into the garden.</s> <s sid="52" id="tenant.c37.s52">I got up to stir the fire.</s> <s sid="53" id="tenant.c37.s53">Mr. Hargrave asked if I felt cold, and shut the door--a very unseasonable piece of officiousness, for I had meditated following the noisy playfellows if they did not speedily return.</s> <s sid="54" id="tenant.c37.s54">He then took the liberty of walking up to the fire himself, and asking me if I were aware that Mr. Huntingdon was now at the seat of Lord Lowborough, and likely to continue there some time.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tenant.c37.p24" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="tenant.c37.s55"><qs/>'No; but it's no matter,'<qe/> I answered carelessly; and if my cheek glowed like fire, it was rather at the question than the information it conveyed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tenant.c37.p25" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="tenant.c37.s56"><qs/>'You don't object to it?'<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tenant.c37.p34" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="tenant.c37.s68"><qs/>'Then, sir, I fear you must be very much worse than you should be, if I, a mere ordinary mortal, am, by your own confession, so vastly your superior; and since there exists so little sympathy between us, I think we had better each look out for some more congenial companion.'<qe/></s> <s sid="69" id="tenant.c37.s69">And forthwith moving to the window, I began to look out for my little son and his gay young friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c43.p2"><s sid="6" id="tenant.c43.s6">He said I was not fit to teach children, or to be with them:</s> <s sid="7" id="tenant.c43.s7">I had already reduced the boy to little better than an automaton; I had broken his fine spirit with my rigid severity; and I should freeze all the sunshine out of his heart, and make him as gloomy an ascetic as myself, if I had the handling of him much longer.</s> <s sid="8" id="tenant.c43.s8">And poor Rachel, too, came in for her share of abuse, as usual; he cannot endure Rachel, because he knows she has a proper appreciation of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c43.p3"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c43.s9">I calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess, and still resisted the proposed addition to our family; but he cut me short by saying it was no use bothering about the matter, for he had engaged a governess already, and she was coming next week; so that all I had to do was to get things ready for her reception.</s> <s sid="10" id="tenant.c43.s10">This was a rather startling piece of intelligence.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c43.s11">I ventured to inquire her name and address, by whom she had been recommended, or how he had been led to make choice of her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c43.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="tenant.c43.s12"><qs/>'She is a very estimable, pious young person,'<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>'you needn't be afraid.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c43.s13">Her name is Myers, I believe; and she was recommended to me by a respectable old dowager: a lady of high repute in the religious world.</s> <s sid="14" id="tenant.c43.s14">I have not seen her myself, and therefore cannot give you a particular account of her person and conversation, and so forth; but, if the old lady's eulogies are correct, you will find her to possess all desirable qualifications for her position: an inordinate love of children among the rest.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tenant.c43.p5"><s sid="15" id="tenant.c43.s15">All this was gravely and quietly spoken, but there was a laughing demon in his half-averted eye that boded no good, I imagined.</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c43.s16">However, I thought of my asylum in --shire, and made no further objections.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tenant.c43.p6"><s sid="17" id="tenant.c43.s17">When Miss Myers arrived, I was not prepared to give her a very cordial reception.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c43.s18">Her appearance was not particularly calculated to produce a favourable impression at first sight, nor did her manners and subsequent conduct, in any degree, remove the prejudice I had already conceived against her.</s> <s sid="19" id="tenant.c43.s19">Her attainments were limited, her intellect noways above mediocrity.</s> <s sid="20" id="tenant.c43.s20">She had a fine voice, and could sing like a nightingale, and accompany herself sufficiently well on the piano; but these were her only accomplishments.</s> <s sid="21" id="tenant.c43.s21">There was a look of guile and subtlety in her face, a sound of it in her voice.</s> <s sid="22" id="tenant.c43.s22">She seemed afraid of me, and would start if I suddenly approached her.</s> <s sid="23" id="tenant.c43.s23">In her behaviour she was respectful and complaisant, even to servility: she attempted to flatter and fawn upon me at first, but I soon checked that.</s> <s sid="24" id="tenant.c43.s24">Her fondness for her little pupil was overstrained, and I was obliged to remonstrate with her on the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious praise; but she could not gain his heart.</s> <s sid="25" id="tenant.c43.s25">Her piety consisted in an occasional heaving of sighs, and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling, and the utterance of a few cant phrases.</s> <s sid="26" id="tenant.c43.s26">She told me she was a clergyman's daughter, and had been left an orphan from her childhood, but had had the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family; and then she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its different members, that I reproached myself for my uncharitable thoughts and unfriendly conduct, and relented for a time, but not for long: my causes of dislike were too rational, my suspicions too well founded for that; and I knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize till those suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tenant.c43.p7"><s sid="27" id="tenant.c43.s27">I asked the name and residence of the kind and pious family.</s> <s sid="28" id="tenant.c43.s28">She mentioned a common name, and an unknown and distant place of abode, but told me they were now on the Continent, and their present address was unknown to her.</s> <s sid="29" id="tenant.c43.s29">I never saw her speak much to Mr. Huntingdon; but he would frequently look into the school-room to see how little Arthur got on with his new companion, when I was not there.</s> <s sid="30" id="tenant.c43.s30">In the evening, she sat with us in the drawing-room, and would sing and play to amuse him or us, as she pretended, and was very attentive to his wants, and watchful to anticipate them, though she only talked to me; indeed, he was seldom in a condition to be talked to.</s> <s sid="31" id="tenant.c43.s31">Had she been other than she was, I should have felt her presence a great relief to come between us thus, except, indeed, that I should have been thoroughly ashamed for any decent person to see him as he often was.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tenant.c43.p8" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="tenant.c43.s32">I did not mention my suspicions to Rachel; but she, having sojourned for half a century in this land of sin and sorrow, has learned to be suspicious herself.</s> <s sid="33" id="tenant.c43.s33">She told me from the first she was <qs/>'down of that new governess,'<qe/> and I soon found she watched her quite as narrowly as I did; and I was glad of it, for I longed to know the truth: the atmosphere of Grassdale seemed to stifle me, and I could only live by thinking of Wildfell Hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tenant.c43.p9"><s sid="34" id="tenant.c43.s34">At last, one morning, she entered my chamber with such intelligence that my resolution was taken before she had ceased to speak.</s> <s sid="35" id="tenant.c43.s35">While she dressed me I explained to her my intentions and what assistance I should require from her, and told her which of my things she was to pack up, and what she was to leave behind for herself, as I had no other means of recompensing her for this sudden dismissal after her long and faithful service: a circumstance I most deeply regretted, but could not avoid.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tenant.c43.p10" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="tenant.c43.s36"><qs/>'And what will you do, Rachel?'<qe/><sss/> said I; <sse/><qs/>'will you go home, or seek another place?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tenant.c43.p11" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="tenant.c43.s37"><qs/>'I have no home, ma'am, but with you,'<qe/><sss/> she replied; <sse/><qs/>'and if I leave you I'll never go into place again as long as I live.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tenant.c43.p12" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="tenant.c43.s38"><qs/>'But I can't afford to live like a lady now,'<qe/> returned I:</s> <s sid="39" id="tenant.c43.s39"><qs/>'I must be my own maid and my child's nurse.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tenant.c43.p13" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="tenant.c43.s40"><qs/>'What signifies!'<qe/> replied she, in some excitement.</s> <s sid="41" id="tenant.c43.s41"><qs/>'You'll want somebody to clean and wash, and cook, won't you?</s> <s sid="42" id="tenant.c43.s42">I can do all that; and never mind the wages:</s> <s sid="43" id="tenant.c43.s43">I've my bits o' savings yet, and if you wouldn't take me I should have to find my own board and lodging out of 'em somewhere, or else work among strangers: and it's what I'm not used to: so you can please yourself, ma'am.'<qe/></s> <s sid="44" id="tenant.c43.s44">Her voice quavered as she spoke, and the tears stood in her eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="tenant.c43.p14" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="tenant.c43.s45"><qs/>'I should like it above all things, Rachel, and I'd give you such wages as I could afford: such as I should give to any servant-of-all-work I might employ: but don't you see I should be dragging you down with me when you have done nothing to deserve it?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tenant.c43.p15" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="tenant.c43.s46"><qs/>'Oh, fiddle!'<qe/> ejaculated she.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="tenant.c43.p16" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="tenant.c43.s47"><qs/>'And, besides, my future way of living will be so widely different to the past: so different to all you have been accustomed to--'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tenant.c43.p17" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="tenant.c43.s48"><qs/>'Do you think, ma'am, I can't bear what my missis can? surely I'm not so proud and so dainty as that comes to; and my little master, too, God bless him!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tenant.c43.p18"><s sid="49" id="tenant.c43.s49">'But I'm young, Rachel; I sha'n't mind it; and Arthur is young too: it will be nothing to him.'</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tenant.c43.p19" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="tenant.c43.s50"><qs/>'Nor me either:</s> <s sid="51" id="tenant.c43.s51">I'm not so old but what I can stand hard fare and hard work, if it's only to help and comfort them as I've loved like my own bairns: for all I'm too old to bide the thoughts o' leaving 'em in trouble and danger, and going amongst strangers myself.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tenant.c43.p20" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="tenant.c43.s52">'Then you sha'n't, Rachel!' cried I, embracing my faithful friend.</s> <s sid="53" id="tenant.c43.s53"><qs/>'We'll all go together, and you shall see how the new life suits you.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tenant.c43.p21" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="tenant.c43.s54"><qs/>'Bless you, honey!'<qe/> cried she, affectionately returning my embrace.</s> <s sid="55" id="tenant.c43.s55"><qs/>'Only let us get shut of this wicked house, and we'll do right enough, you'll see.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tenant.c43.p22" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="tenant.c43.s56"><qs/>'So think I,'<qe/> was my answer; and so that point was settled.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tenant.c43.p23"><s sid="57" id="tenant.c43.s57">By that morning's post I despatched a few hasty lines to Frederick, beseeching him to prepare my asylum for my immediate reception: for I should probably come to claim it within a day after the receipt of that note: and telling him, in few words, the cause of my sudden resolution.</s> <s sid="58" id="tenant.c43.s58">I then wrote three letters of adieu: the first to Esther Hargrave, in which I told her that I found it impossible to stay any longer at Grassdale, or to leave my son under his father's protection; and, as it was of the last importance that our future abode should be unknown to him and his acquaintance, I should disclose it to no one but my brother, through the medium of whom I hoped still to correspond with my friends.</s> <s sid="59" id="tenant.c43.s59">I then gave her his address, exhorted her to write frequently, reiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own concerns, and bade her a fond farewell.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tenant.c43.p24"><s sid="60" id="tenant.c43.s60">The second was to Milicent; much to the same effect, but a little more confidential, as befitted our longer intimacy, and her greater experience and better acquaintance with my circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tenant.c43.p25"><s sid="61" id="tenant.c43.s61">The third was to my aunt: a much more difficult and painful undertaking, and therefore I had left it to the last; but I must give her some explanation of that extraordinary step I had taken: and that quickly, for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or two after my disappearance, as it was probable that Mr. Huntingdon would speedily apply to them to know what was become of me.</s> <s sid="62" id="tenant.c43.s62">At last, however, I told her I was sensible of my error:</s> <s sid="63" id="tenant.c43.s63">I did not complain of its punishment, and I was sorry to trouble my friends with its consequences; but in duty to my son I must submit no longer; it was absolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his father's corrupting influence.</s> <s sid="64" id="tenant.c43.s64">I should not disclose my place of refuge even to her, in order that she and my uncle might be able, with truth, to deny all knowledge concerning it; but any communications addressed to me under cover to my brother would be certain to reach me.</s> <s sid="65" id="tenant.c43.s65">I hoped she and my uncle would pardon the step I had taken, for if they knew all, I was sure they would not blame me; and I trusted they would not afflict themselves on my account, for if I could only reach my retreat in safety and keep it unmolested, I should be very happy, but for the thoughts of them; and should be quite contented to spend my life in obscurity, devoting myself to the training up of my child, and teaching him to avoid the errors of both his parents.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tenant.c43.p26"><s sid="66" id="tenant.c43.s66">These things were done yesterday:</s> <s sid="67" id="tenant.c43.s67">I have given two whole days to the preparation for our departure, that Frederick may have more time to prepare the rooms, and Rachel to pack up the things: for the latter task must be done with the utmost caution and secrecy, and there is no one but me to assist her.</s> <s sid="68" id="tenant.c43.s68">I can help to get the articles together, but I do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes, so as to take up the smallest possible space; and there are her own things to do, as well as mine and Arthur's.</s> <s sid="69" id="tenant.c43.s69">I can ill afford to leave anything behind, since I have no money, except a few guineas in my purse; and besides, as Rachel observed, whatever I left would most likely become the property of Miss Myers, and I should not relish that.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tenant.c43.p27"><s sid="70" id="tenant.c43.s70">But what trouble I have had throughout these two days, struggling to appear calm and collected, to meet him and her as usual, when I was obliged to meet them, and forcing myself to leave my little Arthur in her hands for hours together!</s> <s sid="71" id="tenant.c43.s71">But I trust these trials are over now:</s> <s sid="72" id="tenant.c43.s72">I have laid him in my bed for better security, and never more, I trust, shall his innocent lips be defiled by their contaminating kisses, or his young ears polluted by their words.</s> <s sid="73" id="tenant.c43.s73">But shall we escape in safety?</s> <s sid="74" id="tenant.c43.s74">Oh, that the morning were come, and we were on our way at least!</s> <s sid="75" id="tenant.c43.s75">This evening, when I had given Rachel all the assistance I could, and had nothing left me but to wait, and wish and tremble, I became so greatly agitated that I knew not what to do.</s> <s sid="76" id="tenant.c43.s76">I went down to dinner, but I could not force myself to eat.</s> <s sid="77" id="tenant.c43.s77">Mr. Huntingdon remarked the circumstance.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tenant.c43.p28" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="tenant.c43.s78"><qs/>'What's to do with you now?'<qe/> said he, when the removal of the second course gave him time to look about him.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tenant.c43.p29" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="tenant.c43.s79"><qs/>'I am not well,'<qe/> I replied:</s> <s sid="80" id="tenant.c43.s80"><qs/>'I think I must lie down a little; you won't miss me much?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tenant.c43.p30" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="tenant.c43.s81"><qs/>'Not the least: if you leave your chair, it'll do just as well--better, a trifle,'<qe/><sls/> he muttered, as I left the room, <sle/><qs/>'for I can fancy somebody else fills it.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tenant.c43.p31" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="tenant.c43.s82"><qs/>'Somebody else may fill it to-morrow,'<qe/> I thought, but did not say.</s> <s sid="83" id="tenant.c43.s83"><qs/>'There!</s> <s sid="84" id="tenant.c43.s84">I've seen the last of you, I hope,'<qe/> I muttered, as I closed the door upon him.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tenant.c43.p32"><s sid="85" id="tenant.c43.s85">Rachel urged me to seek repose at once, to recruit my strength for to-morrow's journey, as we must be gone before the dawn; but in my present state of nervous excitement that was entirely out of the question.</s> <s sid="86" id="tenant.c43.s86">It was equally out of the question to sit, or wander about my room, counting the hours and the minutes between me and the appointed time of action, straining my ears and trembling at every sound, lest someone should discover and betray us after all.</s> <s sid="87" id="tenant.c43.s87">I took up a book and tried to read: my eyes wandered over the pages, but it was impossible to bind my thoughts to their contents.</s> <s sid="88" id="tenant.c43.s88">Why not have recourse to the old expedient, and add this last event to my chronicle?</s> <s sid="89" id="tenant.c43.s89">I opened its pages once more, and wrote the above account--with difficulty, at first, but gradually my mind became more calm and steady.</s> <s sid="90" id="tenant.c43.s90">Thus several hours have passed away: the time is drawing near; and now my eyes feel heavy and my frame exhausted.</s> <s sid="91" id="tenant.c43.s91">I will commend my cause to God, and then lie down and gain an hour or two of sleep; and then!--</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tenant.c43.p33"><s sid="92" id="tenant.c43.s92">Little Arthur sleeps soundly.</s> <s sid="93" id="tenant.c43.s93">All the house is still: there can be no one watching.</s> <s sid="94" id="tenant.c43.s94">The boxes were all corded by Benson, and quietly conveyed down the back stairs after dusk, and sent away in a cart to the M-- coach-office.</s> <s sid="95" id="tenant.c43.s95">The name upon the cards was Mrs. Graham, which appellation I mean henceforth to adopt.</s> <s sid="96" id="tenant.c43.s96">My mother's maiden name was Graham, and therefore I fancy I have some claim to it, and prefer it to any other, except my own, which I dare not resume.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="tenant.c44.p2"><s sid="9" id="tenant.c44.s9">What trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us, as we issued from the park!</s> <s sid="10" id="tenant.c44.s10">Then, for one moment, I paused, to inhale one draught of that cool, bracing air, and venture one look back upon the house.</s> <s sid="11" id="tenant.c44.s11">All was dark and still: no light glimmered in the windows, no wreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty sky.</s> <s sid="12" id="tenant.c44.s12">As I bade farewell for ever to that place, the scene of so much guilt and misery, I felt glad that I had not left it before, for now there was no doubt about the propriety of such a step--no shadow of remorse for him I left behind.</s> <s sid="13" id="tenant.c44.s13">There was nothing to disturb my joy but the fear of detection; and every step removed us further from the chance of that.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tenant.c44.p3"><s sid="14" id="tenant.c44.s14">We had left Grassdale many miles behind us before the round red sun arose to welcome our deliverance; and if any inhabitant of its vicinity had chanced to see us then, as we bowled along on the top of the coach, I scarcely think they would have suspected our identity.</s> <s sid="15" id="tenant.c44.s15">As I intend to be taken for a widow, I thought it advisable to enter my new abode in mourning:</s> <s sid="16" id="tenant.c44.s16">I was, therefore, attired in a plain black silk dress and mantle, a black veil (which I kept carefully over my face for the first twenty or thirty miles of the journey), and a black silk bonnet, which I had been constrained to borrow of Rachel, for want of such an article myself.</s> <s sid="17" id="tenant.c44.s17">It was not in the newest fashion, of course; but none the worse for that, under present circumstances.</s> <s sid="18" id="tenant.c44.s18">Arthur was clad in his plainest clothes, and wrapped in a coarse woollen shawl; and Rachel was muffled in a grey cloak and hood that had seen better days, and gave her more the appearance of an ordinary though decent old woman, than of a lady's-maid.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tenant.c44.p4"><s sid="19" id="tenant.c44.s19">Oh, what delight it was to be thus seated aloft, rumbling along the broad, sunshiny road, with the fresh morning breeze in my face, surrounded by an unknown country, all smiling--cheerfully, gloriously smiling in the yellow lustre of those early beams; with my darling child in my arms, almost as happy as myself, and my faithful friend beside me: a prison and despair behind me, receding further, further back at every clatter of the horses' feet; and liberty and hope before!</s> <s sid="20" id="tenant.c44.s20">I could hardly refrain from praising God aloud for my deliverance, or astonishing my fellow-passengers by some surprising outburst of hilarity.</s> </p>
