<p pid="9" id="quatermain.c0.p9"><s sid="31" id="quatermain.c0.s31">When I was in England I used to live in a very fine house--at least I call it a fine house, speaking comparatively, and judging from the standard of the houses I have been accustomed to all my life in Africa--not five hundred yards from the old church where Harry is asleep, and thither I went after the funeral and ate some food; for it is no good starving even if one has just buried all one's earthly hopes.</s> <s sid="32" id="quatermain.c0.s32">But I could not eat much, and soon I took to walking, or rather limping--being permanently lame from the bite of a lion--up and down, up and down the oak-panelled vestibule; for there is a vestibule in my house in England.</s> <s sid="33" id="quatermain.c0.s33">On all the four walls of this vestibule were placed pairs of horns--about a hundred pairs altogether, all of which I had shot myself.</s> <s sid="34" id="quatermain.c0.s34">They are beautiful specimens, as I never keep any horns which are not in every way perfect, unless it may be now and again on account of the associations connected with them.</s> <s sid="35" id="quatermain.c0.s35">In the centre of the room, however, over the wide fireplace, there was a clear space left on which I had fixed up all my rifles.</s> <s sid="36" id="quatermain.c0.s36">Some of them I have had for forty years, old muzzle-loaders that nobody would look at nowadays.</s> <s sid="37" id="quatermain.c0.s37">One was an elephant gun with strips of rimpi, or green hide, lashed round the stock and locks, such as used to be owned by the Dutchmen--a 'roer' they call it.</s> <s sid="38" id="quatermain.c0.s38">That gun, the Boer I bought it from many years ago told me, had been used by his father at the battle of the Blood River, just after Dingaan swept into Natal and slaughtered six hundred men, women, and children, so that the Boers named the place where they died 'Weenen', or the 'Place of Weeping'; and so it is called to this day, and always will be called.</s> <s sid="39" id="quatermain.c0.s39">And many an elephant have I shot with that old gun.</s> <s sid="40" id="quatermain.c0.s40">She always took a handful of black powder and a three-ounce ball, and kicked like the very deuce.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="quatermain.c0.p10"><s sid="41" id="quatermain.c0.s41">Well, up and down I walked, staring at the guns and the horns which the guns had brought low; and as I did so there rose up in me a great craving:--I would go away from this place where I lived idly and at ease, back again to the wild land where I had spent my life, where I met my dear wife and poor Harry was born, and so many things, good, bad, and indifferent, had happened to me.</s> <s sid="42" id="quatermain.c0.s42">The thirst for the wilderness was on me; I could tolerate this place no more; I would go and die as I had lived, among the wild game and the savages.</s> <s sid="43" id="quatermain.c0.s43">Yes, as I walked, I began to long to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and mysterious sea of bush, and watch the lines of game travelling down the ridges to the water.</s> <s sid="44" id="quatermain.c0.s44">The ruling passion is strong in death, they say, and my heart was dead that night.</s> <s sid="45" id="quatermain.c0.s45">But, independently of my trouble, no man who has for forty years lived the life I have, can with impunity go coop himself in this prim English country, with its trim hedgerows and cultivated fields, its stiff formal manners, and its well-dressed crowds.</s> <s sid="46" id="quatermain.c0.s46">He begins to long--ah, how he longs!--for the keen breath of the desert air; he dreams of the sight of Zulu impis breaking on their foes like surf upon the rocks, and his heart rises up in rebellion against the strict limits of the civilized life.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="quatermain.c0.p11"><s sid="47" id="quatermain.c0.s47">Ah! this civilization, what does it all come to?</s> <s sid="48" id="quatermain.c0.s48">For forty years and more I lived among savages, and studied them and their ways; and now for several years I have lived here in England, and have in my own stupid manner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light; and what have I found?</s> <s sid="49" id="quatermain.c0.s49">A great gulf fixed?</s> <s sid="50" id="quatermain.c0.s50">No, only a very little one, that a plain man's thought may spring across.</s> <s sid="51" id="quatermain.c0.s51">I say that as the savage is, so is the white man, only the latter is more inventive, and possesses the faculty of combination; save and except also that the savage, as I have known him, is to a large extent free from the greed of money, which eats like a cancer into the heart of the white man.</s> <s sid="52" id="quatermain.c0.s52">It is a depressing conclusion, but in all essentials the savage and the child of civilization are identical.</s> <s sid="53" id="quatermain.c0.s53">I dare say that the highly civilized lady reading this will smile at an old fool of a hunter's simplicity when she thinks of her black bead-bedecked sister; and so will the superfine cultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club, the cost of which would keep a starving family for a week.</s> <s sid="54" id="quatermain.c0.s54">And yet, my dear young lady, what are those pretty things round your own neck?--they have a strong family resemblance, especially when you wear that _very_ low dress, to the savage woman's beads.</s> <s sid="55" id="quatermain.c0.s55">Your habit of turning round and round to the sound of horns and tom-toms, your fondness for pigments and powders, the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich warrior who has captured you in marriage, and the quickness with which your taste in feathered head-dresses varies--all these things suggest touches of kinship; and you remember that in the fundamental principles of your nature you are quite identical.</s> <s sid="56" id="quatermain.c0.s56">As for you, sir, who also laugh, let some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying that marvellous-looking dish, and we shall soon see how much of the savage there is in _you_.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="quatermain.c0.p12"><s sid="57" id="quatermain.c0.s57">There, I might go on for ever, but what is the good?</s> <s sid="58" id="quatermain.c0.s58">Civilization is only savagery silver-gilt.</s> <s sid="59" id="quatermain.c0.s59">A vainglory is it, and like a northern light, comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark.</s> <s sid="60" id="quatermain.c0.s60">Out of the soil of barbarism it has grown like a tree, and, as I believe, into the soil like a tree it will once more, sooner or later, fall again, as the Egyptian civilization fell, as the Hellenic civilization fell, and as the Roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost count, fell also.</s> <s sid="61" id="quatermain.c0.s61">Do not let me, however, be understood as decrying our modern institutions, representing as they do the gathered experience of humanity applied for the good of all.</s> <s sid="62" id="quatermain.c0.s62">Of course they have great advantages--hospitals for instance; but then, remember, we breed the sickly people who fill them.</s> <s sid="63" id="quatermain.c0.s63">In a savage land they do not exist.</s> <s sid="64" id="quatermain.c0.s64">Besides, the question will arise:</s> <s sid="65" id="quatermain.c0.s65">How many of these blessings are due to Christianity as distinct from civilization?</s> <s sid="66" id="quatermain.c0.s66">And so the balance sways and the story runs--here a gain, there a loss, and Nature's great average struck across the two, whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in that mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity of her purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="quatermain.c0.p13"><s sid="67" id="quatermain.c0.s67">I make no apology for this digression, especially as this is an introduction which all young people and those who never like to think (and it is a bad habit) will naturally skip.</s> <s sid="68" id="quatermain.c0.s68">It seems to me very desirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations of our nature, so that we may not be carried away by the pride of knowledge.</s> <s sid="69" id="quatermain.c0.s69">Man's cleverness is almost indefinite, and stretches like an elastic band, but human nature is like an iron ring.</s> <s sid="70" id="quatermain.c0.s70">You can go round and round it, you can polish it highly, you can even flatten it a little on one side, whereby you will make it bulge out the other, but you will _never_, while the world endures and man is man, increase its total circumference.</s> <s sid="71" id="quatermain.c0.s71">It is the one fixed unchangeable thing--fixed as the stars, more enduring than the mountains, as unalterable as the way of the Eternal.</s> <s sid="72" id="quatermain.c0.s72">Human nature is God's kaleidoscope, and the little bits of coloured glass which represent our passions, hopes, fears, joys, aspirations towards good and evil and what not, are turned in His mighty hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars, and continually fall into new patterns and combinations.</s> <s sid="73" id="quatermain.c0.s73">But the composing elements remain the same, nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor one less for ever and ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="quatermain.c0.p14"><s sid="74" id="quatermain.c0.s74">This being so, supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves into twenty parts, nineteen savage and one civilized, we must look to the nineteen savage portions of our nature, if we would really understand ourselves, and not to the twentieth, which, though so insignificant in reality, is spread all over the other nineteen, making them appear quite different from what they really are, as the blacking does a boot, or the veneer a table.</s> <s sid="75" id="quatermain.c0.s75">It is on the nineteen rough serviceable savage portions that we fall back on emergencies, not on the polished but unsubstantial twentieth.</s> <s sid="76" id="quatermain.c0.s76">Civilization should wipe away our tears, and yet we weep and cannot be comforted.</s> <s sid="77" id="quatermain.c0.s77">Warfare is abhorrent to her, and yet we strike out for hearth and home, for honour and fair fame, and can glory in the blow.</s> <s sid="78" id="quatermain.c0.s78">And so on, through everything.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="quatermain.c0.p15"><s sid="79" id="quatermain.c0.s79">So, when the heart is stricken, and the head is humbled in the dust, civilization fails us utterly.</s> <s sid="80" id="quatermain.c0.s80">Back, back, we creep, and lay us like little children on the great breast of Nature, she that perchance may soothe us and make us forget, or at least rid remembrance of its sting.</s> <s sid="81" id="quatermain.c0.s81">Who has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward features of the universal Mother; to lie on the mountains and watch the clouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the shore, to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life; to feel the slow beat of her eternal heart, and to forget his woes, and let his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of her of whom we are, from whom we came, and with whom we shall again be mingled, who gave us birth, and will in a day to come give us our burial also.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="quatermain.c0.p16"><s sid="82" id="quatermain.c0.s82">And so in my trouble, as I walked up and down the oak-panelled vestibule of my house there in Yorkshire, I longed once more to throw myself into the arms of Nature.</s> <s sid="83" id="quatermain.c0.s83">Not the Nature which you know, the Nature that waves in well-kept woods and smiles out in corn-fields, but Nature as she was in the age when creation was complete, undefiled as yet by any human sinks of sweltering humanity.</s> <s sid="84" id="quatermain.c0.s84">I would go again where the wild game was, back to the land whereof none know the history, back to the savages, whom I love, although some of them are almost as merciless as Political Economy.</s> <s sid="85" id="quatermain.c0.s85">There, perhaps, I should be able to learn to think of poor Harry lying in the churchyard, without feeling as though my heart would break in two.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="quatermain.c0.p17"><s sid="86" id="quatermain.c0.s86">And now there is an end of this egotistical talk, and there shall be no more of it.</s> <s sid="87" id="quatermain.c0.s87">But if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my written thoughts have got so far as this, I ask you to persevere, since what I have to tell you is not without its interest, and it has never been told before, nor will again.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="quatermain.c1.p4"><s sid="13" id="quatermain.c1.s13">Then there was Good, who is not like either of us, being short, dark, stout--_very_ stout--with twinkling black eyes, in one of which an eyeglass is everlastingly fixed.</s> <s sid="14" id="quatermain.c1.s14">I say stout, but it is a mild term; I regret to state that of late years Good has been running to fat in a most disgraceful way.</s> <s sid="15" id="quatermain.c1.s15">Sir Henry tells him that it comes from idleness and over-feeding, and Good does not like it at all, though he cannot deny it.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="quatermain.c2.p16"><s sid="102" id="quatermain.c2.s102">In the distance I heard a hippopotamus splash faintly, then the owl hooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note {Endnote 4}, and the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees, making a heart-chilling music.</s> <s sid="103" id="quatermain.c2.s103">Above was the black bosom of the cloud, and beneath me swept the black flood of the water, and I felt as though I and Death were utterly alone between them.</s> <s sid="104" id="quatermain.c2.s104">It was very desolate.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="quatermain.c3.p21"><s sid="83" id="quatermain.c3.s83">As I was following him, and wondering what on earth he could mean by this, there suddenly appeared, through the door that opened on to the veranda from the house, a dapper little man, dressed in a neat blue cotton suit, with shoes made of tanned hide, and remarkable for a bustling air and most enormous black mustachios, shaped into an upward curve, and coming to a point for all the world like a pair of buffalo-horns.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="quatermain.c3.p25"><s sid="90" id="quatermain.c3.s90">At this everybody began to laugh, and Umslopogaas, perceiving that he was the object of remark, frowned ferociously, for he had a most lordly dislike of anything like a personal liberty.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="quatermain.c3.p29" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="quatermain.c3.s99"><qs/>'Oh,'<qe/><sss/> answered Mrs Mackenzie, <sse/><qs/>'he arrived here of his own accord about a year ago, and asked to be taken into our service.</s> <s sid="100" id="quatermain.c3.s100">He had got into some trouble in France, and fled to Zanzibar, where he found an application had been made by the French Government for his extradition.</s> <s sid="101" id="quatermain.c3.s101">Whereupon he rushed off up-country, and fell in, when nearly starved, with our caravan of men, who were bringing us our annual supply of goods, and was brought on here.</s> <s sid="102" id="quatermain.c3.s102">You should get him to tell you the story.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="quatermain.c6.p2"><s sid="2" id="quatermain.c6.s2">Immediately after we had settled upon the outline of our plan of action as suggested by Umslopogaas, Mr Mackenzie sent for four sharp boys of from twelve to fifteen years of age, and despatched them to various points where they could keep an outlook upon the Masai camp, with others to report from time to time what was going on.</s> <s sid="3" id="quatermain.c6.s3">Other lads and even women were stationed at intervals along the wall in order to guard against the possibility of surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="quatermain.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="quatermain.c9.s1">A week had passed, and we all sat at supper one night in the Mission dining-room, feeling very much depressed in spirits, for the reason that we were going to say goodbye to our kind friends, the Mackenzies, and depart upon our way at dawn on the morrow.</s> <s sid="2" id="quatermain.c9.s2">Nothing more had been seen or heard of the Masai, and save for a spear or two which had been overlooked and was rusting in the grass, and a few empty cartridges where we had stood outside the wall, it would have been difficult to tell that the old cattle kraal at the foot of the slope had been the scene of so desperate a struggle.</s> <s sid="3" id="quatermain.c9.s3">Mackenzie was, thanks chiefly to his being so temperate a man, rapidly recovering from his wound, and could get about on a pair of crutches; and as for the other wounded men, one had died of gangrene, and the rest were in a fair way to recovery.</s> <s sid="4" id="quatermain.c9.s4">Mr Mackenzie's caravan of men had also returned from the coast, so that the station was now amply garrisoned.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="quatermain.c9.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="quatermain.c9.s5">Under these circumstances we concluded, warm and pressing as were the invitations for us to stay, that it was time to move on, first to Mount Kenia, and thence into the unknown in search of the mysterious white race which we had set our hearts on discovering.</s> <s sid="6" id="quatermain.c9.s6">This time we were going to progress by means of the humble but useful donkey, of which we had collected no less than a dozen, to carry our goods and chattels, and, if necessary, ourselves.</s> <s sid="7" id="quatermain.c9.s7">We had now but two Wakwafis left for servants, and found it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into the unknown parts we proposed to explore--and small blame to them.</s> <s sid="8" id="quatermain.c9.s8">After all, as Mr Mackenzie said, it was odd that three men, each of whom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth living--health, sufficient means, and position, etc.--should from their own pleasure start out upon a wild-goose chase, from which the chances were they never would return.</s> <s sid="9" id="quatermain.c9.s9">But then that is what Englishmen are, adventurers to the backbone; and all our magnificent muster-roll of colonies, each of which will in time become a great nation, testify to the extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight looks like a mild form of lunacy.</s> <s sid="10" id="quatermain.c9.s10"><qs/>'Adventurer'<qe/>--he that goes out to meet whatever may come.</s> <s sid="11" id="quatermain.c9.s11">Well, that is what we all do in the world one way or another, and, speaking for myself, I am proud of the title, because it implies a brave heart and a trust in Providence.</s> <s sid="12" id="quatermain.c9.s12">Besides, when many and many a noted Croesus, at whose feet the people worship, and many and many a time-serving and word-coining politician are forgotten, the names of those grand-hearted old adventurers who have made England what she is, will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be.</s> <s sid="13" id="quatermain.c9.s13">Not that we three can expect to be numbered with such as these, yet have we done something--enough, perhaps, to throw a garment over the nakedness of our folly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="quatermain.c9.p4" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="quatermain.c9.s32">Well, the morrow came, and by seven o'clock the donkeys were all loaded, and the time of parting was at hand.</s> <s sid="33" id="quatermain.c9.s33">It was a melancholy business, especially saying goodbye to dear little Flossie.</s> <s sid="34" id="quatermain.c9.s34">She and I were great friends, and often used to have talks together--but her nerves had never got over the shock of that awful night when she lay in the power of those bloodthirsty Masai.</s> <s sid="35" id="quatermain.c9.s35"><qs/>'Oh, Mr Quatermain,'<qe/><sls/> she cried, throwing her arms round my neck and bursting into tears, <sle/><qs/>'I can't bear to say goodbye to you.</s> <s sid="36" id="quatermain.c9.s36">I wonder when we shall meet again?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="quatermain.c9.p6"><s sid="48" id="quatermain.c9.s48">Poor little Flossie cried very much, and gave me a lock of her bright hair in return, which I still have.</s> <s sid="49" id="quatermain.c9.s49">The cheque I gave her was for a thousand pounds (which being now well off, and having no calls upon me except those of charity, I could well afford), and in the note I directed her father to invest it for her in Government security, and when she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace he could get for the money and accumulated interest.</s> <s sid="50" id="quatermain.c9.s50">I chose diamonds because I think that now that King Solomon's Mines are lost to the world, their price will never be much lower than it is at present, so that if in after-life she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties, she will be able to turn them into money.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="quatermain.c9.p7"><s sid="51" id="quatermain.c9.s51">Well, at last we got off, after much hand-shaking, hat-waving, and also farewell saluting from the natives, Alphonse weeping copiously (for he has a warm heart) at parting with his master and mistress; and I was not sorry for it at all, for I hate those goodbyes.</s> <s sid="52" id="quatermain.c9.s52">Perhaps the most affecting thing of all was to witness Umslopogaas' distress at parting with Flossie, for whom the grim old warrior had conceived a strong affection.</s> <s sid="53" id="quatermain.c9.s53">He used to say that she was as sweet to see as the only star on a dark night, and was never tired of loudly congratulating himself on having killed the Lygonani who had threatened to murder her.</s> <s sid="54" id="quatermain.c9.s54">And that was the last we saw of the pleasant Mission-house--a true oasis in the desert--and of European civilization.</s> <s sid="55" id="quatermain.c9.s55">But I often think of the Mackenzies, and wonder how they got down country, and if they are now safe and well in England, and will ever see these words.</s> <s sid="56" id="quatermain.c9.s56">Dear little Flossie!</s> <s sid="57" id="quatermain.c9.s57">I wonder how she fares there where there are no black folk to do her imperious bidding, and no sky-piercing snow-clad Kenia for her to look at when she gets up in the morning.</s> <s sid="58" id="quatermain.c9.s58">And so goodbye to Flossie.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="quatermain.c9.p8"><s sid="59" id="quatermain.c9.s59">After leaving the Mission-house we made our way, comparatively unmolested, past the base of Mount Kenia, which the Masai call 'Donyo Egere', or the 'speckled mountain', on account of the black patches of rock that appear upon its mighty spire, where the sides are too precipitous to allow of the snow lying on them; then on past the lonely lake Baringo, where one of our two remaining Askari, having unfortunately trodden on a puff-adder, died of snake-bite, in spite of all our efforts to save him.</s> <s sid="60" id="quatermain.c9.s60">Thence we proceeded a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snow-clad mountain called Lekakisera, which has never, to the best of my belief, been visited before by a European, but which I cannot now stop to describe.</s> <s sid="61" id="quatermain.c9.s61">There we rested a fortnight, and then started out into the trackless and uninhabited forest of a vast district called Elgumi.</s> <s sid="62" id="quatermain.c9.s62">In this forest alone there are more elephants than I ever met with or heard of before.</s> <s sid="63" id="quatermain.c9.s63">The mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man, and only kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing beyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them.</s> <s sid="64" id="quatermain.c9.s64">Needless to say, however, we did not shoot many of them, first because we could not afford to waste ammunition, of which our stock was getting perilously low, a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in fording a flooded river; and secondly, because we could not carry away the ivory, and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter.</s> <s sid="65" id="quatermain.c9.s65">So we let the great beasts be, only shooting one or two in self-protection.</s> <s sid="66" id="quatermain.c9.s66">In this district, the elephants, being unacquainted with the hunter and his tender mercies, would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of them in the open, while they stood, with their great ears cocked for all the world like puzzled and gigantic puppy-dogs, and stared at that new and extraordinary phenomenon--man.</s> <s sid="67" id="quatermain.c9.s67">Occasionally, when the inspection did not prove satisfactory, the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge, but this did not often happen.</s> <s sid="68" id="quatermain.c9.s68">When it did we had to use our rifles.</s> <s sid="69" id="quatermain.c9.s69">Nor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great Elgumi forest.</s> <s sid="70" id="quatermain.c9.s70">All sorts of large game abounded, including lions--confound them!</s> <s sid="71" id="quatermain.c9.s71">I have always hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for life.</s> <s sid="72" id="quatermain.c9.s72">As a consequence, another thing that abounded was the dreadful tsetse fly, whose bite is death to domestic animals.</s> <s sid="73" id="quatermain.c9.s73">Donkeys have, together with men, hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity from its attacks; but all I have to say, whether it was on account of their poor condition, or because the tsetse in those parts is more poisonous than usual, I do not know, but ours succumbed to its onslaught.</s> <s sid="74" id="quatermain.c9.s74">Fortunately, however, that was not till two months or so after the bites had been inflicted, when suddenly, after a two days' cold rain, they all died, and on removing the skins of several of them I found the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of death from bites from the tsetse, marking the spot where the insect had inserted his proboscis.</s> <s sid="75" id="quatermain.c9.s75">On emerging from the great Elgumi forest, we, still steering northwards, in accordance with the information Mr Mackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him only to die so tragically, struck the base in due course of the large lake, called Laga by the natives, which is about fifty miles long by twenty broad, and of which, it may be remembered, he made mention.</s> <s sid="76" id="quatermain.c9.s76">Thence we pushed on nearly a month's journey over great rolling uplands, something like those in the Transvaal, but diversified by patches of bush country.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="quatermain.c9.p9"><s sid="77" id="quatermain.c9.s77">All this time we were continually ascending at the rate of about one hundred feet every ten miles.</s> <s sid="78" id="quatermain.c9.s78">Indeed the country was on a slope which appeared to terminate at a mass of snow-tipped mountains, for which we were steering, and where we learnt the second lake of which the wanderer had spoken as the lake without a bottom was situated.</s> <s sid="79" id="quatermain.c9.s79">At length we arrived there, and, having ascertained that there _was_ a large lake on top of the mountains, ascended three thousand feet more till we came to a precipitous cliff or edge, to find a great sheet of water some twenty miles square lying fifteen hundred feet below us, and evidently occupying an extinct volcanic crater or craters of vast extent.</s> <s sid="80" id="quatermain.c9.s80">Perceiving villages on the border of this lake, we descended with great difficulty through forests of pine trees, which now clothed the precipitous sides of the crater, and were well received by the people, a simple, unwarlike folk, who had never seen or even heard of a white man before, and treated us with great reverence and kindness, supplying us with as much food and milk as we could eat and drink.</s> <s sid="81" id="quatermain.c9.s81">This wonderful and beautiful lake lay, according to our aneroid, at a height of no less than 11,450 feet above sea-level, and its climate was quite cold, and not at all unlike that of England.</s> <s sid="82" id="quatermain.c9.s82">Indeed, for the first three days of our stay there we saw little or nothing of the scenery on account of an unmistakable Scotch mist which prevailed.</s> <s sid="83" id="quatermain.c9.s83">It was this rain that set the tsetse poison working in our remaining donkeys, so that they all died.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="quatermain.c9.p10"><s sid="84" id="quatermain.c9.s84">This disaster left us in a very awkward position, as we had now no means of transport whatever, though on the other hand we had not much to carry.</s> <s sid="85" id="quatermain.c9.s85">Ammunition, too, was very short, amounting to but one hundred and fifty rounds of rifle cartridges and some fifty shot-gun cartridges.</s> <s sid="86" id="quatermain.c9.s86">How to get on we did not know; indeed it seemed to us that we had about reached the end of our tether.</s> <s sid="87" id="quatermain.c9.s87">Even if we had been inclined to abandon the object of our search, which, shadow as it was, was by no means the case, it was ridiculous to think of forcing our way back some seven hundred miles to the coast in our present plight; so we came to the conclusion that the only thing to be done was to stop where we were--the natives being so well disposed and food plentiful--for the present, and abide events, and try to collect information as to the countries beyond.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="quatermain.c9.p11"><s sid="88" id="quatermain.c9.s88">Accordingly, having purchased a capital log canoe, large enough to hold us all and our baggage, from the headman of the village we were staying in, presenting him with three empty cold-drawn brass cartridges by way of payment, with which he was perfectly delighted, we set out to make a tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a camp.</s> <s sid="89" id="quatermain.c9.s89">As we did not know if we should return to this village, we put all our gear into the canoe, and also a quarter of cooked water-buck, which when young is delicious eating, and off we set, natives having already gone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other villages of our approach.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="quatermain.c9.p12"><s sid="90" id="quatermain.c9.s90">As we were puddling leisurely along Good remarked upon the extraordinary deep blue colour of the water, and said that he understood from the natives, who were great fishermen--fish, indeed, being their principal food--that the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep, and to have a hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some great fire that was raging below.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="quatermain.c9.p13"><s sid="91" id="quatermain.c9.s91">I pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend arising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time when one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity.</s> <s sid="92" id="quatermain.c9.s92">We saw several round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working at a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater which now formed the bed of the lake itself.</s> <s sid="93" id="quatermain.c9.s93">When it finally became extinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run down and put out the big fire below, more especially as, though it was constantly fed by streams running from the snow-tipped peaks about, there was no visible exit to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="quatermain.c11.p33"><s sid="172" id="quatermain.c11.s172">This staircase with its supports was, indeed, a work of which any living man might have been proud, both on account of its magnitude and its surpassing beauty.</s> <s sid="173" id="quatermain.c11.s173">Four times, as we afterwards learnt, did the work, which was commenced in remote antiquity, fail, and was then abandoned for three centuries when half-finished, till at last there rose a youthful engineer named Rademas, who said that he would complete it successfully, and staked his life upon it.</s> <s sid="174" id="quatermain.c11.s174">If he failed he was to be hurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale; if he succeeded, he was to be rewarded by the hand of the king's daughter.</s> <s sid="175" id="quatermain.c11.s175">Five years was given to him to complete the work, and an unlimited supply of labour and material.</s> <s sid="176" id="quatermain.c11.s176">Three times did his arch fall, till at last, seeing failure to be inevitable, he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the third collapse.</s> <s sid="177" id="quatermain.c11.s177">That night, however, a beautiful woman came to him in a dream and touched his forehead, and of a sudden he saw a vision of the completed work, and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties connected with the flying arch that had hitherto baffled his genius were to be overcome.</s> <s sid="178" id="quatermain.c11.s178">Then he awoke and once more commenced the work, but on a different plan, and behold! he achieved it, and on the last day of the five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into the palace.</s> <s sid="179" id="quatermain.c11.s179">And in due course he became king by right of his wife, and founded the present Zu-Vendi dynasty, which is to this day called the 'House of the Stairway', thus proving once more how energy and talent are the natural stepping-stones to grandeur.</s> <s sid="180" id="quatermain.c11.s180">And to commemorate his triumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming, and of the fair woman who touched him on the forehead, and placed it in the great hall of the palace, and there it stands to this day.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="quatermain.c11.p34"><s sid="181" id="quatermain.c11.s181">Such was the great stair of Milosis, and such the city beyond.</s> <s sid="182" id="quatermain.c11.s182">No wonder they named it the 'Frowning City', for certainly those mighty works in solid granite did seem to frown down upon our littleness in their sombre splendour.</s> <s sid="183" id="quatermain.c11.s183">This was so even in the sunshine, but when the storm-clouds gathered on her imperial brow Milosis looked more like a supernatural dwelling-place, or some imagining of a poet's brain, than what she is--a mortal city, carven by the patient genius of generations out of the red silence of the mountain side.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="quatermain.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="quatermain.c13.s1">And now the curtain is down for a few hours, and the actors in this novel drama are plunged in dewy sleep.</s> <s sid="2" id="quatermain.c13.s2">Perhaps we should except Nyleptha, whom the reader may, if poetically inclined, imagine lying in her bed of state encompassed by her maidens, tiring women, guards, and all the other people and appurtenances that surround a throne, and yet not able to slumber for thinking of the strangers who had visited a country where no such strangers had ever come before, and wondering, as she lay awake, who they were and what their past has been, and if she was ugly compared to the women of their native place.</s> <s sid="3" id="quatermain.c13.s3">I, however, not being poetically inclined, will take advantage of the lull to give some account of the people among whom we found ourselves, compiled, needless to state, from information which we subsequently collected.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="quatermain.c13.p2"><s sid="4" id="quatermain.c13.s4">The name of this country, to begin at the beginning, is Zu-Vendis, from Zu, 'yellow', and Vendis, 'place or country'.</s> <s sid="5" id="quatermain.c13.s5">Why it is called the Yellow Country I have never been able to ascertain accurately, nor do the inhabitants themselves know.</s> <s sid="6" id="quatermain.c13.s6">Three reasons are, however, given, each of which would suffice to account for it.</s> <s sid="7" id="quatermain.c13.s7">The first is that the name owes its origin to the great quantity of gold that is found in the land.</s> <s sid="8" id="quatermain.c13.s8">Indeed, in this respect Zu-Vendis is a veritable Eldorado, the precious metal being extraordinarily plentiful.</s> <s sid="9" id="quatermain.c13.s9">At present it is collected from purely alluvial diggings, which we subsequently inspected, and which are situated within a day's journey from Milosis, being mostly found in pockets and in nuggets weighing from an ounce up to six or seven pounds in weight.</s> <s sid="10" id="quatermain.c13.s10">But other diggings of a similar nature are known to exist, and I have besides seen great veins of gold-bearing quartz.</s> <s sid="11" id="quatermain.c13.s11">In Zu-Vendis gold is a much commoner metal than silver, and thus it has curiously enough come to pass that silver is the legal tender of the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="quatermain.c13.p3"><s sid="12" id="quatermain.c13.s12">The second reason given is, that at certain times of the year the native grasses of the country, which are very sweet and good, turn as yellow as ripe corn; and the third arises from a tradition that the people were originally yellow skinned, but grew white after living for many generations upon these high lands.</s> <s sid="13" id="quatermain.c13.s13">Zu-Vendis is a country about the size of France, is, roughly speaking, oval in shape; and on every side cut off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of impenetrable thorn, beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of morasses, deserts, and great mountains.</s> <s sid="14" id="quatermain.c13.s14">It is, in short, a huge, high tableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent, much as in southern Africa flat-topped mountains rise from the level of the surrounding veldt.</s> <s sid="15" id="quatermain.c13.s15">Milosis itself lies, according to my aneroid, at a level of about nine thousand feet above the sea, but most of the land is even higher, the greatest elevation of the open country being, I believe, about eleven thousand feet.</s> <s sid="16" id="quatermain.c13.s16">As a consequence the climate is, comparatively speaking, a cold one, being very similar to that of southern England, only brighter and not so rainy.</s> <s sid="17" id="quatermain.c13.s17">The land is, however, exceedingly fertile, and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and timber to perfection; and in the lower-lying parts even produces a hardy variety of sugar-cane.</s> <s sid="18" id="quatermain.c13.s18">Coal is found in great abundance, and in many places crops out from the surface; and so is pure marble, both black and white.</s> <s sid="19" id="quatermain.c13.s19">The same may be said of almost every metal except silver, which is scarce, and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the north.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="quatermain.c13.p4"><s sid="20" id="quatermain.c13.s20">Zu-Vendis comprises in her boundaries a great variety of scenery, including two ranges of snow-clad mountains, one on the western boundary beyond the impenetrable belt of thorn forest, and the other piercing the country from north to south, and passing at a distance of about eighty miles from Milosis, from which town its higher peaks are distinctly visible.</s> <s sid="21" id="quatermain.c13.s21">This range forms the chief watershed of the land.</s> <s sid="22" id="quatermain.c13.s22">There are also three large lakes--the biggest, namely that whereon we emerged, and which is named Milosis after the city, covering some two hundred square miles of country--and numerous small ones, some of them salt.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="quatermain.c13.p5"><s sid="23" id="quatermain.c13.s23">The population of this favoured land is, comparatively speaking, dense, numbering at a rough estimate from ten to twelve millions.</s> <s sid="24" id="quatermain.c13.s24">It is almost purely agricultural in its habits, and divided into great classes as in civilized countries.</s> <s sid="25" id="quatermain.c13.s25">There is a territorial nobility, a considerable middle class, formed principally of merchants, officers of the army, etc.; but the great bulk of the people are well-to-do peasants who live upon the lands of the lords, from whom they hold under a species of feudal tenure.</s> <s sid="26" id="quatermain.c13.s26">The best bred people in the country are, as I think I have said, pure whites with a somewhat southern cast of countenance; but the common herd are much darker, though they do not show any negro or other African characteristics.</s> <s sid="27" id="quatermain.c13.s27">As to their descent I can give no certain information.</s> <s sid="28" id="quatermain.c13.s28">Their written records, which extend back for about a thousand years, give no hint of it.</s> <s sid="29" id="quatermain.c13.s29">One very ancient chronicler does indeed, in alluding to some old tradition that existed in his day, talk of it as having probably originally 'come down with the people from the coast', but that may mean little or nothing.</s> <s sid="30" id="quatermain.c13.s30">In short, the origin of the Zu-Vendi is lost in the mists of time.</s> <s sid="31" id="quatermain.c13.s31">Whence they came or of what race they are no man knows.</s> <s sid="32" id="quatermain.c13.s32">Their architecture and some of their sculptures suggest an Egyptian or possibly an Assyrian origin; but it is well known that their present remarkable style of building has only sprung up within the last eight hundred years, and they certainly retain no traces of Egyptian theology or customs.</s> <s sid="33" id="quatermain.c13.s33">Again, their appearance and some of their habits are rather Jewish; but here again it seems hardly conceivable that they should have utterly lost all traces of the Jewish religion.</s> <s sid="34" id="quatermain.c13.s34">Still, for aught I know, they may be one of the lost ten tribes whom people are so fond of discovering all over the world, or they may not.</s> <s sid="35" id="quatermain.c13.s35">I do not know, and so can only describe them as I find them, and leave wiser heads than mine to make what they can out of it, if indeed this account should ever be read at all, which is exceedingly doubtful.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="quatermain.c13.p6"><s sid="36" id="quatermain.c13.s36">And now after I have said all this, I am, after all, going to hazard a theory of my own, though it is only a very little one, as the young lady said in mitigation of her baby.</s> <s sid="37" id="quatermain.c13.s37">This theory is founded on a legend which I have heard among the Arabs on the east coast, which is to the effect that 'more than two thousand years ago' there were troubles in the country which was known as Babylonia, and that thereon a vast horde of Persians came down to Bushire, where they took ship and were driven by the north-east monsoon to the east coast of Africa, where, according to the legend, 'the sun and fire worshippers' fell into conflict with the belt of Arab settlers who even then were settled on the east coast, and finally broke their way through them, and, vanishing into the interior, were no more seen.</s> <s sid="38" id="quatermain.c13.s38">Now, I ask, is it not at least possible that the Zu-Vendi people are the descendants of these 'sun and fire worshippers' who broke through the Arabs and vanished?</s> <s sid="39" id="quatermain.c13.s39">As a matter of fact, there is a good deal in their characters and customs that tallies with the somewhat vague ideas that I have of Persians.</s> <s sid="40" id="quatermain.c13.s40">Of course we have no books of reference here, but Sir Henry says that if his memory does not fail him, there was a tremendous revolt in Babylon about 500 BC, whereon a vast multitude were expelled from the city.</s> <s sid="41" id="quatermain.c13.s41">Anyhow, it is a well-established fact that there have been many separate emigrations of Persians from the Persian Gulf to the east coast of Africa up to as lately as seven hundred years ago.</s> <s sid="42" id="quatermain.c13.s42">There are Persian tombs at Kilwa, on the east coast, still in good repair, which bear dates showing them to be just seven hundred years old.</s> <s sid="43" id="quatermain.c13.s43">{Endnote 12}</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="quatermain.c13.p7"><s sid="44" id="quatermain.c13.s44">In addition to being an agricultural people, the Zu-Vendi are, oddly enough, excessively warlike, and as they cannot from the exigencies of their position make war upon other nations, they fight among each other like the famed Kilkenny cats, with the happy result that the population never outgrows the power of the country to support it.</s> <s sid="45" id="quatermain.c13.s45">This habit of theirs is largely fostered by the political condition of the country.</s> <s sid="46" id="quatermain.c13.s46">The monarchy is nominally an absolute one, save in so far as it is tempered by the power of the priests and the informal council of the great lords; but, as in many other institutions, the king's writ does not run unquestioned throughout the length and breadth of the land.</s> <s sid="47" id="quatermain.c13.s47">In short, the whole system is a purely feudal one (though absolute serfdom or slavery is unknown), all the great lords holding nominally from the throne, but a number of them being practically independent, having the power of life and death, waging war against and making peace with their neighbours as the whim or their interests lead them, and even on occasion rising in open rebellion against their royal master or mistress, and, safely shut up in their castles and fenced cities, as far from the seat of government, successfully defying them for years.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="quatermain.c13.p8"><s sid="48" id="quatermain.c13.s48">Zu-Vendis has had its king-makers as well as England, a fact that will be well appreciated when I state that eight different dynasties have sat upon the throne in the last one thousand years, every one of which took its rise from some noble family that succeeded in grasping the purple after a sanguinary struggle.</s> <s sid="49" id="quatermain.c13.s49">At the date of our arrival in the country things were a little better than they had been for some centuries, the last king, the father of Nyleptha and Sorais, having been an exceptionally able and vigorous ruler, and, as a consequence, he kept down the power of the priests and nobles.</s> <s sid="50" id="quatermain.c13.s50">On his death, two years before we reached Zu-Vendis, the twin sisters, his children, were, following an ancient precedent, called to the throne, since an attempt to exclude either would instantly have provoked a sanguinary civil war; but it was generally felt in the country that this measure was a most unsatisfactory one, and could hardly be expected to be permanent.</s> <s sid="51" id="quatermain.c13.s51">Indeed, as it was, the various intrigues that were set on foot by ambitious nobles to obtain the hand of one or other of the queens in marriage had disquieted the country, and the general opinion was that there would be bloodshed before long.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="quatermain.c13.p9"><s sid="52" id="quatermain.c13.s52">I will now pass on to the question of the Zu-Vendi religion, which is nothing more or less than sun-worship of a pronounced and highly developed character.</s> <s sid="53" id="quatermain.c13.s53">Around this sun-worship is grouped the entire social system of the Zu-Vendi.</s> <s sid="54" id="quatermain.c13.s54">It sends its roots through every institution and custom of the land.</s> <s sid="55" id="quatermain.c13.s55">From the cradle to the grave the Zu-Vendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying.</s> <s sid="56" id="quatermain.c13.s56">As an infant he is solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to 'the symbol of good, the expression of power, and the hope of Eternity', the ceremony answering to our baptism.</s> <s sid="57" id="quatermain.c13.s57">Whilst still a tiny child, his parents point out the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god, and he worships it at its up-rising and down-setting.</s> <s sid="58" id="quatermain.c13.s58">Then when still quite small, he goes, holding fast to the pendent end of his mother's 'kaf' (toga), up to the temple of the Sun of the nearest city, and there, when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden central altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon, he hears the white-robed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the people fall down to adore, and then, amidst the blowing of the golden trumpets, watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath the altar.</s> <s sid="59" id="quatermain.c13.s59">Here he comes again to be declared 'a man' by the priests, and consecrated to war and to good works; here before the solemn altar he leads his bride; and here too, if differences shall unhappily arise, he divorces her.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="quatermain.c13.p10"><s sid="60" id="quatermain.c13.s60">And so on, down life's long pathway till the last mile is travelled, and he comes again armed indeed, and with dignity, but no longer a man.</s> <s sid="61" id="quatermain.c13.s61">Here they bear him dead and lay his bier upon the falling brazen doors before the eastern altar, and when the last ray from the setting sun falls upon his white face the bolts are drawn and he vanishes into the raging furnace beneath and is ended.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="quatermain.c13.p11"><s sid="62" id="quatermain.c13.s62">The priests of the Sun do not marry, but are recruited as young men specially devoted to the work by their parents and supported by the State.</s> <s sid="63" id="quatermain.c13.s63">The nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with the Crown, but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed, and it is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land.</s> <s sid="64" id="quatermain.c13.s64">To begin with, they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy, so that an order issued by the High Priest at Milosis will be instantly and unhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country town three or four hundred miles off.</s> <s sid="65" id="quatermain.c13.s65">They are the judges of the land, criminal and civil, an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of the district, and from him to the king; and they have, of course, practically unlimited jurisdiction over religious and moral offences, together with a right of excommunication, which, as in the faiths of more highly civilized lands, is a very effective weapon.</s> <s sid="66" id="quatermain.c13.s66">Indeed, their rights and powers are almost unlimited, but I may as well state here that the priests of the Sun are wise in their generation, and do not push things too far.</s> <s sid="67" id="quatermain.c13.s67">It is but very seldom that they go to extremes against anybody, being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorous-minded people on whose neck they have set their yoke, lest it should rise and break it off altogether.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="quatermain.c13.p12"><s sid="68" id="quatermain.c13.s68">Another source of the power of the priests is their practical monopoly of learning, and their very considerable astronomical knowledge, which enables them to keep a hold on the popular mind by predicting eclipses and even comets.</s> <s sid="69" id="quatermain.c13.s69">In Zu-Vendis only a few of the upper classes can read and write, but nearly all the priests have this knowledge, and are therefore looked upon as learned men.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="quatermain.c13.p13"><s sid="70" id="quatermain.c13.s70">The law of the country is, on the whole, mild and just, but differs in several respects from our civilized law.</s> <s sid="71" id="quatermain.c13.s71">For instance, the law of England is much more severe upon offences against property than against the person, as becomes a people whose ruling passion is money.</s> <s sid="72" id="quatermain.c13.s72">A man may half kick his wife to death or inflict horrible sufferings upon his children at a much cheaper rate of punishment than he can compound for the theft of a pair of old boots.</s> <s sid="73" id="quatermain.c13.s73">In Zu-Vendis this is not so, for there they rightly or wrongly look upon the person as of more consequence than goods and chattels, and not, as in England, as a sort of necessary appendage to the latter.</s> <s sid="74" id="quatermain.c13.s74">For murder the punishment is death, for treason death, for defrauding the orphan and the widow, for sacrilege, and for attempting to quit the country (which is looked on as a sacrilege) death.</s> <s sid="75" id="quatermain.c13.s75">In each case the method of execution is the same, and a rather awful one.</s> <s sid="76" id="quatermain.c13.s76">The culprit is thrown alive into the fiery furnace beneath one of the altars to the Sun.</s> <s sid="77" id="quatermain.c13.s77">For all other offences, including the offence of idleness, the punishment is forced labour upon the vast national buildings which are always going on in some part of the country, with or without periodical floggings, according to the crime.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="quatermain.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="quatermain.c15.s1">After our escape from Agon and his pious crew we returned to our quarters in the palace and had a very good time.</s> <s sid="2" id="quatermain.c15.s2">The two Queens, the nobles and the people vied with each other in doing us honour and showering gifts upon us.</s> <s sid="3" id="quatermain.c15.s3">As for that painful little incident of the hippopotami it sank into oblivion, where we were quite content to leave it.</s> <s sid="4" id="quatermain.c15.s4">Every day deputations and individuals waited on us to examine our guns and clothing, our chain shirts, and our instruments, especially our watches, with which they were much delighted.</s> <s sid="5" id="quatermain.c15.s5">In short, we became quite the rage, so much so that some of the fashionable young swells among the Zu-Vendi began to copy the cut of some of our clothes, notably Sir Henry's shooting jacket.</s> <s sid="6" id="quatermain.c15.s6">One day, indeed, a deputation waited on us and, as usual, Good donned his full-dress uniform for the occasion.</s> <s sid="7" id="quatermain.c15.s7">This deputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally came to visit us.</s> <s sid="8" id="quatermain.c15.s8">They were little insignificant men of an excessively polite, not to say servile, demeanour; and their attention appeared to be chiefly taken up with observing the details of Good's full-dress uniform, of which they took copious notes and measurements.</s> <s sid="9" id="quatermain.c15.s9">Good was much flattered at the time, not suspecting that he had to deal with the six leading tailors of Milosis.</s> <s sid="10" id="quatermain.c15.s10">A fortnight afterwards, however, when on attending court as usual he had the pleasure of seeing some seven or eight Zu-Vendi 'mashers' arrayed in all the glory of a very fair imitation of his full-dress uniform, he changed his mind.</s> <s sid="11" id="quatermain.c15.s11">I shall never forget his face of astonishment and disgust.</s> <s sid="12" id="quatermain.c15.s12">It was after this, chiefly to avoid remark, and also because our clothes were wearing out and had to be saved up, that we resolved to adopt the native dress; and a very comfortable one we found it, though I am bound to say that I looked sufficiently ridiculous in it, and as for Alphonse!</s> <s sid="13" id="quatermain.c15.s13">Only Umslopogaas would have none of these things; when his moocha was worn out the fierce old Zulu made him a new one, and went about unconcerned, as grim and naked as his own battleaxe.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="quatermain.c15.p2"><s sid="14" id="quatermain.c15.s14">Meanwhile we pursued our study of the language steadily and made very good progress.</s> <s sid="15" id="quatermain.c15.s15">On the morning following our adventure in the temple, three grave and reverend signiors presented themselves armed with manuscript books, ink-horns and feather pens, and indicated that they had been sent to teach us.</s> <s sid="16" id="quatermain.c15.s16">So, with the exception of Umslopogaas, we all buckled to with a will, doing four hours a day.</s> <s sid="17" id="quatermain.c15.s17">As for Umslopogaas, he would have none of that either.</s> <s sid="18" id="quatermain.c15.s18">He did not wish to learn that 'woman's talk', not he; and when one of the teachers advanced on him with a book and an ink-horn and waved them before him in a mild persuasive way, much as a churchwarden invitingly shakes the offertory bag under the nose of a rich but niggardly parishioner, he sprang up with a fierce oath and flashed Inkosi-kaas before the eyes of our learned friend, and there was an end of the attempt to teach _him_ Zu-Vendi.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="quatermain.c15.p3"><s sid="19" id="quatermain.c15.s19">Thus we spent our mornings in useful occupation which grew more and more interesting as we proceeded, and the afternoons were given up to recreation.</s> <s sid="20" id="quatermain.c15.s20">Sometimes we made trips, notably one to the gold mines and another to the marble quarries both of which I wish I had space and time to describe; and sometimes we went out hunting buck with dogs trained for that purpose, and a very exciting sport it is, as the country is full of agricultural enclosures and our horses were magnificent.</s> <s sid="21" id="quatermain.c15.s21">This is not to be wondered at, seeing that the royal stables were at our command, in addition to which we had four splendid saddle horses given to us by Nyleptha.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="quatermain.c15.p4"><s sid="22" id="quatermain.c15.s22">Sometimes, again, we went hawking, a pastime that is in great favour among the Zu-Vendi, who generally fly their birds at a species of partridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its flight.</s> <s sid="23" id="quatermain.c15.s23">When attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head, and, instead of seeking cover, flies high into the sky, thus offering wonderful sport.</s> <s sid="24" id="quatermain.c15.s24">I have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out of sight when followed by the hawk.</s> <s sid="25" id="quatermain.c15.s25">Still better sport is offered by a variety of solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock, which is plentiful in this country, and which is flown at with a very small, agile, and highly-trained hawk with an almost red tail.</s> <s sid="26" id="quatermain.c15.s26">The zigzagging of the great snipe and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the red-tailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one.</s> <s sid="27" id="quatermain.c15.s27">Another variety of the same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope with trained eagles; and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the great bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the sunlight, and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannon-ball upon some cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything but that piercing eye.</s> <s sid="28" id="quatermain.c15.s28">Still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes the buck running.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="quatermain.c15.p5"><s sid="29" id="quatermain.c15.s29">On other days we would pay visits to the country seats at some of the great lords' beautiful fortified places, and the villages clustering beneath their walls.</s> <s sid="30" id="quatermain.c15.s30">Here we saw vineyards and corn-fields and well-kept park-like grounds, with such timber in them as filled me with delight, for I do love a good tree.</s> <s sid="31" id="quatermain.c15.s31">There it stands so strong and sturdy, and yet so beautiful, a very type of the best sort of man.</s> <s sid="32" id="quatermain.c15.s32">How proudly it lifts its bare head to the winter storms, and with what a full heart it rejoices when the spring has come again!</s> <s sid="33" id="quatermain.c15.s33">How grand its voice is, too, when it talks with the wind: a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf.</s> <s sid="34" id="quatermain.c15.s34">All day it points to the sunshine and all night to the stars, and thus passionless, and yet full of life, it endures through the centuries, come storm, come shine, drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth, and as the slow years roll by, learning the great mysteries of growth and of decay.</s> <s sid="35" id="quatermain.c15.s35">And so on and on through generations, outliving individuals, customs, dynasties--all save the landscape it adorns and human nature--till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and rejoices over a reclaimed space, or decay puts the last stroke to his fungus-fingered work.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="quatermain.c15.p6"><s sid="36" id="quatermain.c15.s36">Ah, one should always think twice before one cuts down a tree!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="quatermain.c15.p7"><s sid="37" id="quatermain.c15.s37">In the evenings it was customary for Sir Henry, Good, and myself to dine, or rather sup, with their Majesties--not every night, indeed, but about three or four times a week, whenever they had not much company, or the affairs of state would allow of it.</s> <s sid="38" id="quatermain.c15.s38">And I am bound to say that those little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that I ever had to do with.</s> <s sid="39" id="quatermain.c15.s39">How true is the saying that the very highest in rank are always the most simple and kindly.</s> <s sid="40" id="quatermain.c15.s40">It is from your half-and-half sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity, the difference between the two being very much what one sees every day in England between the old, out-at-elbows, broken-down county family, and the overbearing, purse-proud people who come and 'take the place'.</s> <s sid="41" id="quatermain.c15.s41">I really think that Nyleptha's greatest charm is her sweet simplicity, and her kindly genuine interest even in little things.</s> <s sid="42" id="quatermain.c15.s42">She is the simplest woman I ever knew, and where her passions are not involved, one of the sweetest; but she can look queenly enough when she likes, and be as fierce as any savage too.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="quatermain.c15.p8"><s sid="43" id="quatermain.c15.s43">For instance, never shall I forget that scene when I for the first time was sure that she was really in love with Curtis.</s> <s sid="44" id="quatermain.c15.s44">It came about in this way--all through Good's weakness for ladies' society.</s> <s sid="45" id="quatermain.c15.s45">When we had been employed for some three months in learning Zu-Vendi, it struck Master Good that he was getting rather tired of the old gentlemen who did us the honour to lead us in the way that we should go, so he proceeded, without saying a word to anybody else, to inform them that it was a peculiar fact, but that we could not make any real progress in the deeper intricacies of a foreign language unless we were taught by ladies--young ladies, he was careful to explain.</s> <s sid="46" id="quatermain.c15.s46">In his own country, he pointed out, it was habitual to choose the very best-looking and most charming girls who could be found to instruct any strangers who happened to come that way, etc.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="quatermain.c15.p9"><s sid="47" id="quatermain.c15.s47">All of this the old gentlemen swallowed open-mouthed.</s> <s sid="48" id="quatermain.c15.s48">There was, they admitted, reason in what he said, since the contemplation of the beautiful, as their philosophy taught, induced a certain porosity of mind similar to that produced upon the physical body by the healthful influences of sun and air.</s> <s sid="49" id="quatermain.c15.s49">Consequently it was probable that we might absorb the Zu-Vendi tongue a little faster if suitable teachers could be found.</s> <s sid="50" id="quatermain.c15.s50">Another thing was that, as the female sex was naturally loquacious, good practice would be gained in the viva voce department of our studies.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="quatermain.c15.p10"><s sid="51" id="quatermain.c15.s51">To all of this Good gravely assented, and the learned gentlemen departed, assuring him that their orders were to fall in with our wishes in every way, and that, if possible, our views should be met.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="quatermain.c15.p11"><s sid="52" id="quatermain.c15.s52">Imagine, therefore the surprise and disgust of myself, and I trust and believe Sir Henry, when, on entering the room where we were accustomed to carry on our studies the following morning, we found, instead of our usual venerable tutors, three of the best-looking young women whom Milosis could produce--and that is saying a good deal--who blushed and smiled and curtseyed, and gave us to understand that they were there to carry on our instruction.</s> <s sid="53" id="quatermain.c15.s53">Then Good, as we gazed at one another in bewilderment, thought fit to explain, saying that it had slipped his memory before--but the old gentlemen had told him, on the previous evening, that it was absolutely necessary that our further education should be carried on by the other sex.</s> <s sid="54" id="quatermain.c15.s54">I was overwhelmed, and appealed to Sir Henry for advice in such a crisis.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="quatermain.c15.p12" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="quatermain.c15.s55"><qs/>'Well,'<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>'you see the ladies are here, ain't they?</s> <s sid="56" id="quatermain.c15.s56">If we sent them away, don't you think it might hurt their feelings, eh?</s> <s sid="57" id="quatermain.c15.s57">One doesn't like to be rough, you see; and they look regular _blues_, don't they, eh?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="quatermain.c15.p13" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="quatermain.c15.s58">By this time Good had already begun his lessons with the handsomest of the three, and so with a sigh I yielded.</s> <s sid="59" id="quatermain.c15.s59">That day everything went very well: the young ladies were certainly very clever, and they only smiled when we blundered.</s> <s sid="60" id="quatermain.c15.s60">I never saw Good so attentive to his books before, and even Sir Henry appeared to tackle Zu-Vendi with a renewed zest.</s> <s sid="61" id="quatermain.c15.s61"><qs/>'Ah,'<qe/><sss/> thought I, <sse/><qs/>'will it always be thus?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="quatermain.c15.p14"><s sid="62" id="quatermain.c15.s62">Next day we were much more lively, our work was pleasingly interspersed with questions about our native country, what the ladies were like there, etc., all of which we answered as best as we could in Zu-Vendi, and I heard Good assuring his teacher that her loveliness was to the beauties of Europe as the sun to the moon, to which she replied with a little toss of the head, that she was a plain teaching woman and nothing else, and that it was not kind 'to deceive a poor girl so'.</s> <s sid="63" id="quatermain.c15.s63">Then we had a little singing that was really charming, so natural and unaffected.</s> <s sid="64" id="quatermain.c15.s64">The Zu-Vendi love-songs are most touching.</s> <s sid="65" id="quatermain.c15.s65">On the third day we were all quite intimate.</s> <s sid="66" id="quatermain.c15.s66">Good narrated some of his previous love affairs to his fair teacher, and so moved was she that her sighs mingled with his own.</s> <s sid="67" id="quatermain.c15.s67">I discoursed with mine, a merry blue-eyed girl, upon Zu-Vendian art, and never saw that she was waiting for an opportunity to drop a specimen of the cockroach tribe down my back, whilst in the corner Sir Henry and his governess appeared, so far as I could judge, to be going through a lesson framed on the great educational principles laid down by Wackford Squeers Esq., though in a very modified or rather spiritualized form.</s> <s sid="68" id="quatermain.c15.s68">The lady softly repeated the Zu-Vendi word for 'hand', and he took hers; 'eyes', and he gazed deep into her brown orbs; 'lips', and--but just at that moment _my_ young lady dropped the cockroach down my back and ran away laughing.</s> <s sid="69" id="quatermain.c15.s69">Now if there is one thing I loathe more than another it is cockroaches, and moved quite beyond myself, and yet laughing at her impudence, I took up the cushion she had been sitting on and threw it after her.</s> <s sid="70" id="quatermain.c15.s70">Imagine then my shame--my horror, and my distress--when the door opened, and, attended by two guards only, in walked _Nyleptha_.</s> <s sid="71" id="quatermain.c15.s71">The cushion could not be recalled (it missed the girl and hit one of the guards on the head), but I instantly and ineffectually tried to look as though I had not thrown it.</s> <s sid="72" id="quatermain.c15.s72">Good ceased his sighing, and began to murder Zu-Vendi at the top of his voice, and Sir Henry whistled and looked silly.</s> <s sid="73" id="quatermain.c15.s73">As for the poor girls, they were utterly dumbfounded.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="quatermain.c15.p15"><s sid="74" id="quatermain.c15.s74">And Nyleptha! she drew herself up till her frame seemed to tower even above that of the tall guards, and her face went first red, and then pale as death.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="quatermain.c15.p24"><s sid="90" id="quatermain.c15.s90">Presently, however, one of the guards returned with a message to the girls that they were, on pain of death, to leave the city and return to their homes in the country, and that no further harm would come to them; and accordingly they went, one of them remarking philosophically that it could not be helped, and that it was a satisfaction to know that they had taught us a little serviceable Zu-Vendi.</s> <s sid="91" id="quatermain.c15.s91">Mine was an exceedingly nice girl, and, overlooking the cockroach, I made her a present of my favourite lucky sixpence with a hole in it when she went away.</s> <s sid="92" id="quatermain.c15.s92">After that our former masters resumed their course of instruction, needless to say to my great relief.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="quatermain.c15.p25"><s sid="93" id="quatermain.c15.s93">That night, when in fear and trembling we attended the royal supper table, we found that Nyleptha was laid up with a bad headache.</s> <s sid="94" id="quatermain.c15.s94">That headache lasted for three whole days; but on the fourth she was present at supper as usual, and with the most gracious and sweet smile gave Sir Henry her hand to lead her to the table.</s> <s sid="95" id="quatermain.c15.s95">No allusion was made to the little affair described above beyond her saying, with a charming air of innocence, that when she came to see us at our studies the other day she had been seized with a giddiness from which she had only now recovered.</s> <s sid="96" id="quatermain.c15.s96">She supposed, she added with a touch of the humour that was common to her, that it was the sight of people working so hard which had affected her.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="quatermain.c15.p26"><s sid="97" id="quatermain.c15.s97">In reply Sir Henry said, dryly, that he had thought she did not look quite herself on that day, whereat she flashed one of those quick glances of hers at him, which if he had the feelings of a man must have gone through him like a knife, and the subject dropped entirely.</s> <s sid="98" id="quatermain.c15.s98">Indeed, after supper was over Nyleptha condescended to put us through an examination to see what we had learnt, and to express herself well satisfied with the results.</s> <s sid="99" id="quatermain.c15.s99">Indeed, she proceeded to give us, especially Sir Henry, a lesson on her own account, and very interesting we found it.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="quatermain.c19.p29"><s sid="92" id="quatermain.c19.s92">This, no doubt, was the cause of her anxiety to get a hold of Good, whom she would have used till he ceased to be of service and then cast off.</s> <s sid="93" id="quatermain.c19.s93">But Good having drawn back she grasped at the opportunity of securing Alphonse, who was not unlike him in personal appearance though smaller, no doubt with the object of showing him off in the cities and country as the great Bougwan himself.</s> <s sid="94" id="quatermain.c19.s94">I told Good that I thought that that was her plan, and his face was a sight to see--he was so horrified at the idea.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="quatermain.c24.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="quatermain.c24.s8">The messenger who is to go--and I wish him joy of his journey--is Alphonse.</s> <s sid="9" id="quatermain.c24.s9">For a long while he has been wearied to death of Zu-Vendis and its inhabitants.</s> <s sid="10" id="quatermain.c24.s10"><qs/>'Oh, oui, c'est beau,'<qe/><sls/> he says, with an expressive shrug; <sle/><qs/>'mais je m'ennuie; ce n'est pas chic.'<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="quatermain.c24.s11">Again, he complains dreadfully of the absence of cafes and theatres, and moans continually for his lost Annette, of whom he says he dreams three times a week.</s> <s sid="12" id="quatermain.c24.s12">But I fancy his secret cause of disgust at the country, putting aside the homesickness to which every Frenchman is subject, is that the people here laugh at him so dreadfully about his conduct on the occasion of the great battle of the Pass about eighteen months ago, when he hid beneath a banner in Sorais's tent in order to avoid being sent forth to fight, which he says would have gone against his conscience.</s> <s sid="13" id="quatermain.c24.s13">Even the little boys call out at him in the streets, thereby offending his pride and making his life unbearable.</s> <s sid="14" id="quatermain.c24.s14">At any rate, he has determined to brave the horrors of a journey of almost unprecedented difficulty and danger, and also to run the risk of falling into the hands of the French police to answer for a certain little indiscretion of his own some years old (though I do not consider that a very serious matter), rather than remain in ce triste pays.</s> <s sid="15" id="quatermain.c24.s15">Poor Alphonse! we shall be very sorry to part with him; but I sincerely trust, for his own sake and also for the sake of this history, which is, I think, worth giving to the world, that he may arrive in safety.</s> <s sid="16" id="quatermain.c24.s16">If he does, and can carry the treasure we have provided him with in the shape of bars of solid gold, he will be, comparatively speaking, a rich man for life, and well able to marry his Annette, if she is still in the land of the living and willing to marry her Alphonse.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="quatermain.c24.p3"><s sid="17" id="quatermain.c24.s17">Anyhow, on the chance, I may as well add a word or two to dear old Quatermain's narrative.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="quatermain.c24.p4"><s sid="18" id="quatermain.c24.s18">He died at dawn on the day following that on which he wrote the last words of the last chapter.</s> <s sid="19" id="quatermain.c24.s19">Nyleptha, Good and myself were present, and a most touching and yet in its way beautiful scene it was.</s> <s sid="20" id="quatermain.c24.s20">An hour before the daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking, and our distress was very keen.</s> <s sid="21" id="quatermain.c24.s21">Indeed, Good melted into tears at the idea--a fact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying friend, for even at that hour he could be humorous.</s> <s sid="22" id="quatermain.c24.s22">Good's emotion had, by loosening the muscles, naturally caused his eyeglass to fall from its accustomed place, and Quatermain, who always observed everything, observed this also.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="quatermain.c24.p5" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="quatermain.c24.s23"><qs/>'At last,'<qe/><sls/> he gasped, with an attempt at a smile, <sle/><qs/>'I have seen Good without his eyeglass.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="quatermain.c24.p6"><s sid="24" id="quatermain.c24.s24">After that he said no more till the day broke, when he asked to be lifted up to watch the rising of the sun for the last time.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="quatermain.c24.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="quatermain.c24.s25"><qs/>'In a very few minutes,'<qe/><sls/> he said, after gazing earnestly at it, <sle/><qs/>'I shall have passed through those golden gates.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="quatermain.c24.p8"><s sid="26" id="quatermain.c24.s26">Ten minutes afterwards he raised himself and looked us fixedly in the face.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="quatermain.c24.p9" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="quatermain.c24.s27"><qs/>'I am going a stranger journey than any we have ever taken together.</s> <s sid="28" id="quatermain.c24.s28">Think of me sometimes,'<qe/> he murmured.</s> <s sid="29" id="quatermain.c24.s29"><qs/>'God bless you all.</s> <s sid="30" id="quatermain.c24.s30">I shall wait for you.'<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="quatermain.c24.s31">And with a sigh he fell back dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="quatermain.c24.p10"><s sid="32" id="quatermain.c24.s32">And so passed away a character that I consider went as near perfection as any it has ever been my lot to encounter.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="quatermain.c24.p11" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="quatermain.c24.s33">Tender, constant, humorous, and possessing of many of the qualities that go to make a poet, he was yet almost unrivalled as a man of action and a citizen of the world.</s> <s sid="34" id="quatermain.c24.s34">I never knew any one so competent to form an accurate judgment of men and their motives.</s> <s sid="35" id="quatermain.c24.s35"><qs/>'I have studied human nature all my life,'<qe/><sss/> he would say, <sse/><qs/>'and I ought to know something about it,'<qe/> and he certainly did.</s> <s sid="36" id="quatermain.c24.s36">He had but two faults--one was his excessive modesty, and the other a slight tendency which he had to be jealous of anybody on whom he concentrated his affections.</s> <s sid="37" id="quatermain.c24.s37">As regards the first of these points, anybody who reads what he has written will be able to form his own opinion; but I will add one last instance of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="quatermain.c24.p12"><s sid="38" id="quatermain.c24.s38">As the reader will doubtless remember, it is a favourite trick of his to talk of himself as a timid man, whereas really, though very cautious, he possessed a most intrepid spirit, and, what is more, never lost his head.</s> <s sid="39" id="quatermain.c24.s39">Well, in the great battle of the Pass, where he got the wound that finally killed him, one would imagine from the account which he gives of the occurrence that it was a chance blow that fell on him in the scrimmage.</s> <s sid="40" id="quatermain.c24.s40">As a matter of fact, however, he was wounded in a most gallant and successful attempt to save Good's life, at the risk and, as it ultimately turned out, at the cost of his own.</s> <s sid="41" id="quatermain.c24.s41">Good was down on the ground, and one of Nasta's highlanders was about to dispatch him, when Quatermain threw himself on to his prostrate form and received the blow on his own body, and then, rising, killed the soldier.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="quatermain.c24.p13"><s sid="42" id="quatermain.c24.s42">As regards his jealousy, a single instance which I give in justice to myself and Nyleptha will suffice.</s> <s sid="43" id="quatermain.c24.s43">The reader will, perhaps, recollect that in one or two places he speaks as though Nyleptha monopolized me, and he was left by both of us rather out in the cold.</s> <s sid="44" id="quatermain.c24.s44">Now Nyleptha is not perfect, any more than any other woman is, and she may be a little exigeante at times, but as regards Quatermain the whole thing is pure imagination.</s> <s sid="45" id="quatermain.c24.s45">Thus when he complains about my not coming to see him when he is ill, the fact was that, in spite of my entreaties, the doctors positively forbade it.</s> <s sid="46" id="quatermain.c24.s46">Those little remarks of his pained me very much when I read them, for I loved Quatermain as dearly as though he were my own father, and should never have dreamed of allowing my marriage to interfere with that affection.</s> <s sid="47" id="quatermain.c24.s47">But let it pass; it is, after all, but one little weakness, which makes no great show among so many and such lovable virtues.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="quatermain.c24.p14"><s sid="48" id="quatermain.c24.s48">Well, he died, and Good read the Burial Service over him in the presence of Nyleptha and myself; and then his remains were, in deference to the popular clamour, accorded a great public funeral, or rather cremation.</s> <s sid="49" id="quatermain.c24.s49">I could not help thinking, however, as I marched in that long and splendid procession up to the Temple, how he would have hated the whole thing could he have been there to see it, for he had a horror of ostentation.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="quatermain.c24.p15"><s sid="50" id="quatermain.c24.s50">And so, a few minutes before sunset, on the third night after his death, they laid him on the brazen flooring before the altar, and waited for the last ray of the setting sun to fall upon his face.</s> <s sid="51" id="quatermain.c24.s51">Presently it came, and struck him like a golden arrow, crowning the pale brows with glory, and then the trumpets blew, and the flooring revolved, and all that remained of our beloved friend fell into the furnace below.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="quatermain.c24.p16"><s sid="52" id="quatermain.c24.s52">We shall never see his like again if we live a hundred years.</s> <s sid="53" id="quatermain.c24.s53">He was the ablest man, the truest gentleman, the firmest friend, the finest sportsman, and, I believe, the best shot in all Africa.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="quatermain.c24.p17"><s sid="54" id="quatermain.c24.s54">And so ended the very remarkable and adventurous life of Hunter Quatermain.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="quatermain.c24.p18"><s sid="55" id="quatermain.c24.s55">Since then things have gone very well with us.</s> <s sid="56" id="quatermain.c24.s56">Good has been, and still is, busily employed in the construction of a navy on Lake Milosis and another of the large lakes, by means of which we hope to be able to increase trade and commerce, and also to overcome some very troublesome and warlike sections of the population who live upon their borders.</s> <s sid="57" id="quatermain.c24.s57">Poor fellow! he is beginning to get over the sad death of that misguided but most attractive woman, Sorais, but it is a sad blow to him, for he was really deeply attached to her.</s> <s sid="58" id="quatermain.c24.s58">I hope, however, that he will in time make a suitable marriage and get that unhappy business out of his head.</s> <s sid="59" id="quatermain.c24.s59">Nyleptha has one or two young ladies in view, especially a daughter of Nasta's (who was a widower), a very fine imperial-looking girl, but with too much of her father's intriguing, and yet haughty, spirit to suit my taste.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="quatermain.c24.p19"><s sid="60" id="quatermain.c24.s60">As for myself, I should scarcely know where to begin if I set to work to describe my doings, so I had best leave them undescribed, and content myself with saying that, on the whole, I am getting on very well in my curious position of King-Consort--better, indeed, than I had any right to expect.</s> <s sid="61" id="quatermain.c24.s61">But, of course, it is not all plain sailing, and I find the responsibilities very heavy.</s> <s sid="62" id="quatermain.c24.s62">Still, I hope to be able to do some good in my time, and I intend to devote myself to two great ends--namely, to the consolidation of the various clans which together make up the Zu-Vendi people, under one strong central government, and to the sapping of the power of the priesthood.</s> <s sid="63" id="quatermain.c24.s63">The first of these reforms will, if it can be carried out, put an end to the disastrous civil wars that have for centuries devastated this country; and the second, besides removing a source of political danger, will pave the road for the introduction of true religion in the place of this senseless Sun worship.</s> <s sid="64" id="quatermain.c24.s64">I yet hope to see the shadow of the Cross of Christ lying on the golden dome of the Flower Temple; or, if I do not, that my successors may.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="quatermain.c24.p20"><s sid="65" id="quatermain.c24.s65">There is one more thing that I intend to devote myself to, and that is the total exclusion of all foreigners from Zu-Vendis.</s> <s sid="66" id="quatermain.c24.s66">Not, indeed, that any more are ever likely to get here, but if they do, I warn them fairly that they will be shown the shortest way out of the country.</s> <s sid="67" id="quatermain.c24.s67">I do not say this from any sense of inhospitality, but because I am convinced of the sacred duty that rests upon me of preserving to this, on the whole, upright and generous-hearted people the blessings of comparative barbarism.</s> <s sid="68" id="quatermain.c24.s68">Where would all my brave army be if some enterprising rascal were to attack us with field-guns and Martini-Henrys?</s> <s sid="69" id="quatermain.c24.s69">I cannot see that gunpowder, telegraphs, steam, daily newspapers, universal suffrage, etc., etc., have made mankind one whit the happier than they used to be, and I am certain that they have brought many evils in their train.</s> <s sid="70" id="quatermain.c24.s70">I have no fancy for handing over this beautiful country to be torn and fought for by speculators, tourists, politicians and teachers, whose voice is as the voice of Babel, just as those horrible creatures in the valley of the underground river tore and fought for the body of the wild swan; nor will I endow it with the greed, drunkenness, new diseases, gunpowder, and general demoralization which chiefly mark the progress of civilization amongst unsophisticated peoples.</s> <s sid="71" id="quatermain.c24.s71">If in due course it pleases Providence to throw Zu-Vendis open to the world, that is another matter; but of myself I will not take the responsibility, and I may add that Good entirely approves of my decision.</s> <s sid="72" id="quatermain.c24.s72">Farewell.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="quatermain.c24.p23"><s sid="75" id="quatermain.c24.s75">PS--I quite forgot to say that about nine months ago Nyleptha (who is very well and, in my eyes at any rate, more beautiful than ever) presented me with a son and heir.</s> <s sid="76" id="quatermain.c24.s76">He is a regular curly-haired, blue-eyed young Englishman in looks, and, though he is destined, if he lives, to inherit the throne of Zu-Vendis, I hope I may be able to bring him up to become what an English gentleman should be, and generally is--which is to my mind even a prouder and a finer thing than being born heir apparent to the great House of the Stairway, and, indeed, the highest rank that a man can reach upon this earth.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="quatermain.c24.p26"><s sid="79" id="quatermain.c24.s79">The MS of this history, addressed to me in the handwriting of my dear brother Henry Curtis, whom we had given up for dead, and bearing the Aden postmark, reached me in safety on December 20, 18--, or a little more than two years after it left his hands in the far centre of Africa, and I hasten to give the astonishing story it contains to the world.</s> <s sid="80" id="quatermain.c24.s80">Speaking for myself, I have read it with very mixed feelings; for though it is a great relief to know that he and Good are alive and strangely prosperous, I cannot but feel that for me and for all their friends they might as well be dead, since we can never hope to see them more.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="quatermain.c24.p27"><s sid="81" id="quatermain.c24.s81">They have cut themselves off from old England and from their homes and their relations for ever, and perhaps, under the circumstances, they were right and wise to do so.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="quatermain.c24.p28"><s sid="82" id="quatermain.c24.s82">How the MS came to be posted I have been quite unable to discover; but I presume, from the fact of its being posted at all, that the little Frenchman, Alphonse, accomplished his hazardous journey in safety.</s> <s sid="83" id="quatermain.c24.s83">I have, however, advertised for him and caused various inquiries to be made in Marseilles and elsewhere with a view of discovering his whereabouts, but so far without the slightest success.</s> <s sid="84" id="quatermain.c24.s84">Possibly he is dead, and the packet was posted by another hand; or possibly he is now happily wedded to his Annette, but still fears the vengeance of the law, and prefers to remain incognito.</s> <s sid="85" id="quatermain.c24.s85">I cannot say, I have not yet abandoned my hopes of finding him, but I am bound to say that they grow fainter day by day, and one great obstacle to my search is that nowhere in the whole history does Mr Quatermain mention his surname.</s> <s sid="86" id="quatermain.c24.s86">He is always spoken of as 'Alphonse', and there are so many Alphonses.</s> <s sid="87" id="quatermain.c24.s87">The letters which my brother Henry says he is sending with the packet of manuscript have never arrived, so I presume that they are lost or destroyed.</s> </p>
