<author>Catherine Sinclair</author>
<p pid="1" id="holiday.c0.p1"><s>"Young heads are giddy, and young hearts are warm, And make mistakes for manhood to reform."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="holiday.c0.p2"><s>Cowper.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="holiday.c0.p3"><s>PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="holiday.c0.p4"><s>"Of all the paper I have blotted, I have written nothing without the intention of some good.</s> <s>Whether I have succeeded or not, is for others to judge."</s> <s>Sir William Temple.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="holiday.c0.p5"><s>The minds of young people are now manufactured like webs of linen, all alike, and nothing left to nature.</s> <s>From the hour when children can speak, till they come to years of discretion or of indiscretion, they are carefully prompted what to say, and what to think, and what to look, and how to feel; while in most school-rooms nature has been turned out of doors with obloquy, and art has entirely supplanted her.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="holiday.c0.p6"><s>When a quarrel takes place, both parties are generally in some degree to blame; therefore if Art and Nature could yet be made to go hand in hand towards the formation of character and principles, a graceful and beautiful superstructure might be reared, on the solid foundation of Christian faith and sound morality; so that while many natural weeds and wild flowers would be pruned and carefully trained, some lovely blossoms that spring spontaneously in the uncultivated soil, might still be cherished into strength and beauty, far excelling what can be planted or reared by art.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="holiday.c0.p7" type="speech"><s>Every infant is probably born with a character as peculiar to himself as the features in his countenance, if his faults and good qualities were permitted to expand according to their original tendency; but education, which formerly did too little in teaching <qs/>"the young idea how to shoot,"<qe/> seems now in danger of over-shooting the mark altogether, by not allowing the young ideas to exist at all.</s> <s>In this age of wonderful mechanical inventions, the very mind of youth seems in danger of becoming a machine; and while every effort is used to stuff the memory, like a cricket-ball, with well-known facts and ready-made opinions, no room is left for the vigour of natural feeling, the glow of natural genius, and the ardour of natural enthusiasm.</s> <s>It was a remark of Sir Walter Scott's many years ago, to the author herself, that in the rising generation there would be no poets, wits, or orators, because all play of imagination is now carefully discouraged, and books written for young persons are generally a mere dry record of facts, unenlivened by any appeal to the heart, or any excitement to the fancy.</s> <s>The catalogue of a child's library would contain Conversations on Natural Philosophy,--on Chemistry,--on Botany,--on Arts and Sciences,--Chronological Records of History,--and travels as dry as a road-book; but nothing on the habits or ways of thinking, natural and suitable to the taste of children; therefore, while such works are delightful to the parents and teachers who select them, the younger community are fed with strong meat instead of milk, and the reading which might be a relaxation from study, becomes a study in itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="holiday.c0.p8" type="speech"><s>In these pages the author has endeavoured to paint that species of noisy, frolicsome, mischievous children which is now almost extinct, wishing to preserve a sort of fabulous remembrance of days long past, when young people were like wild horses on the prairies, rather than like well-broken hacks on the road; and when, amidst many faults and many eccentricities, there was still some individuality of character and feeling allowed to remain.</s> <s>In short, as Lord Byron described <qs/>"the last man,"<qe/><sls/> the object of this volume is, to describe <sle/><qs/>"the last boy."<qe/></s> <s>It may be useful, she thinks, to show, that amidst much requiring to be judiciously curbed and corrected, there may be the germs of high and generous feeling, and of steady, right principle, which should be the chief objects of culture and encouragement.</s> <s>Plodding industry is in the present day at a very high premium in education; but it requires the leaven of mental energy and genius to make it work well, while it has been remarked by one whose experience in education is deep and practical, that <qs/>"those boys whose names appear most frequently in the black book of transgression, would sometimes deserve to be also most commonly recorded, if a book were kept for warm affections and generous actions."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="holiday.c0.p9" type="speech"><s>The most formidable person to meet in society at present, is the mother of a promising boy, about nine or ten years old; because there is no possible escape from a volume of anecdotes, and a complete system of education on the newest principles.</s> <s>The young gentleman has probably asked leave to bring his books to the breakfast-room,--can scarcely be torn away from his studies at the dinner-hour,--discards all toys,--abhors a holiday,--propounds questions of marvellous depth in politics or mineralogy,--and seems, in short, more fitted to enjoy the learned meeting at Newcastle, than the exhilarating exercises of the cricket-ground; but, if the axiom be true, that <qs/>"a little learning is a dangerous thing,"<qe/> it has also been proved by frequent, and sometimes by very melancholy experience, that, for minds not yet expanded to maturity, a great deal of learning is more dangerous still, and that in those school-rooms where there has been a society for the suppression of amusement, the mental energies have suffered, as well as the health.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="holiday.c0.p10"><s>A prejudice has naturally arisen against giving works of fiction to children, because their chief interest too often rests on the detection and punishment of such mean vices as lying and stealing, which are so frequently and elaborately described, that the way to commit those crimes is made obvious, while a clever boy thinks he could easily avoid the oversights by which another has been discovered, and that if he does not yield to similar temptations, he is a model of virtue and good-conduct.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="holiday.c0.p11"><s>In writing for any class of readers, and especially in occupying the leisure moments of such peculiarly fortunate young persons as have leisure moments at all, the author feels conscious of a deep responsibility, for it is at their early age that the seed can best be sown which shall bear fruit unto eternal life, therefore it is hoped this volume may be found to inculcate a pleasing and permanent consciousness, that religion is the best resource in happier hours, and the only refuge in hours of affliction.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="holiday.c0.p12" type="speech"><s>Those who wish to be remembered for ever in the world,--and it is a very common object of ambition,--will find no monument more permanent, than the affectionate remembrance of any children they have treated with kindness; for we may often observe, in the reminiscences of old age, a tender recollection surviving all others, of friends in early days who enlivened the hours of childhood by presents of playthings and comfits.</s> <s>But above all, we never forget those who good-humouredly complied with the constantly recurring petition of all young people in every generation, and in every house--<qs/>"Will you tell me a story?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="holiday.c0.p13"><s>In answer to such a request, often and importunately repeated, the author has from year to year delighted in seeing herself surrounded by a circle of joyous, eager faces, listening with awe to the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, or smiling at the frolics of Harry and Laura.</s> <s>The stories, originally, were so short, that some friends, aware of their popularity, and conscious of their harmless tendency, took the trouble of copying them in manuscript for their own young friends; but the tales have since grown and expanded during frequent verbal repetitions, till, with various fanciful additions and new characters, they have enlarged into their present form, or rather so far beyond it, that several chapters are omitted, to keep the volume within moderate compass.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="holiday.c0.p14" type="speech"><s>Paley remarks, that <qs/>"any amusement which is innocent, is better than none; as the writing of a book, the building of a house, the laying out of a garden, the digging of a fish-pond, even the raising of a cucumber;"<qe/> and it is hoped that, while the author herself has found much interesting occupation in recording these often repeated stories, the time of herself and her young readers may be employed with some degree of profit, or she will certainly regret that it was not better occupied in the rearing of cucumbers.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I. CHIT CHAT.</title>
<p pid="1" id="holiday.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="holiday.c1.s1">A school-boy, a dog, and a walnut tree, The more you strike 'em, the better they be.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="holiday.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="holiday.c1.s2">Laura and Harry Graham could scarcely feel sure that they ever had a mama, because she died while they were yet very young indeed; but Frank, who was some years older, recollected perfectly well what pretty playthings she used to give him, and missed his kind, good mama so extremely, that he one day asked if he might <qs/>"go to a shop and buy a new mama?"<qe/></s> <s sid="3" id="holiday.c1.s3">Frank often afterwards thought of the time also, when he kneeled beside her bed to say his prayers, or when he sat upon her knee to hear funny stories about good boys and bad boys--all very interesting, and all told on purpose to show how much happier obedient children are, than those who waste their time in idleness and folly.</s> <s sid="4" id="holiday.c1.s4">Boys and girls all think they know the road to happiness without any mistake, and choose that which looks gayest and pleasantest at first, though older people, who have travelled that road already, can tell them that a very difficult path is the only one which ends agreeably; and those who begin to walk in it when they are young, will really find that <qs/>"wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."<qe/></s> <s sid="5" id="holiday.c1.s5">It was truly remarked by Solomon, that <qs/>"even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right."<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="holiday.c1.s6">Therefore, though Frank was yet but a little boy, his friends, who observed how carefully he attended to his mama's instructions, how frequently he studied his Bible, and how diligently he learned his lessons, all prophesied that this merry, lively child, with laughing eyes, and dimpled cheeks, would yet grow up to be a good and useful man; especially when it became evident that, by the blessing of God, he had been early turned away from the broad road that leadeth to destruction, in which every living person would naturally walk, and led into the narrow path that leadeth to eternal life.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="holiday.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="holiday.c1.s7">When his mama, Lady Graham, after a long and painful illness, was at last taken away to the better world, for which she had been many years preparing, her only sorrow and anxiety seemed to be that she left behind her three such very dear children, who were now to be entirely under the care of their papa, Sir Edward Graham; and it was with many prayers and tears that she tried to make her mind more easy about their future education, and future happiness.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="holiday.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="holiday.c1.s8">Sir Edward felt such extreme grief on the death of Lady Graham, that instead of being able to remain at home with his young family, and to interest his mind as he would wish to have done, by attending to them, he was ordered by Dr. Bell, to set off immediately for Paris, Rome, and Naples, where it was hoped he might leave his distresses behind him while he travelled, or at all events, forget them.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="holiday.c1.p5"><s sid="9" id="holiday.c1.s9">Luckily the children had a very good, kind uncle, Major David Graham, and their grandmama, Lady Harriet Graham, who were both exceedingly happy to take charge of them, observing that no house could be cheerful without a few little people being there, and that now they would have constant amusement in trying to make Frank, Harry, and Laura, as happy as possible, and even still happier.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="holiday.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="holiday.c1.s10"><qs/>"That is the thing I am almost afraid of!"<qe/> said Sir Edward, smiling.</s> <s sid="11" id="holiday.c1.s11"><qs/>"Uncles and grandmamas are only too kind, and my small family will be quite spoiled by indulgence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="holiday.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="holiday.c1.s12"><qs/>"Not if you leave that old vixen, Mrs. Crabtree, as governor of the nursery,"<qe/> answered Major Graham, laughing.</s> <s sid="13" id="holiday.c1.s13"><qs/>"She ought to have been the drummer of a regiment, she is so fond of the rod!</s> <s sid="14" id="holiday.c1.s14">I believe there never was such a tyrant since the time when nursery-maids were invented.</s> <s sid="15" id="holiday.c1.s15">Poor Harry would pass his life in a dark closet, like Baron Trenck, if Mrs. Crabtree had her own way!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="holiday.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="holiday.c1.s16"><qs/>"She means it all well.</s> <s sid="17" id="holiday.c1.s17">I am certain that Mrs. Crabtree is devotedly fond of my children, and would go through fire and water to serve them; but she is a little severe perhaps.</s> <s sid="18" id="holiday.c1.s18">Her idea is, that if you never forgive a first fault, you will never hear of a second, which is probably true enough.</s> <s sid="19" id="holiday.c1.s19">At all events, her harshness will be the best remedy for your extreme indulgence; therefore let me beg that you and my mother will seldom interfere with her <alt-qs/>'method,'<alt-qe/> especially in respect to Harry and Laura.</s> <s sid="20" id="holiday.c1.s20">As for Frank, if all boys were like him, we might make a bonfire of birch rods and canes.</s> <s sid="21" id="holiday.c1.s21">He is too old for nursery discipline now, and must be flogged at school, if deserving of it at all, till he goes to sea next year with my friend Gordon, who has promised to rate him as a volunteer of the first class, on board the Thunderbolt."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="holiday.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="holiday.c1.s22">In spite of Mrs. Crabtree's admirable "system" with children, Harry and Laura became, from this time, two of the most heedless, frolicsome beings in the world, and had to be whipped almost every morning; for in those days it had not been discovered that whipping is all a mistake, and that children can be made good without it; though some old-fashioned people still say--and such, too, who take the God of truth for their guide--the old plan succeeded best, and those who <qs/>"spare the rod will spoil the child."<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="holiday.c1.s23">When Lady Harriet and Major Graham spoke kindly to Harry and Laura, about anything wrong that had been done, they both felt more sad and sorry, than after the severest punishments of Mrs. Crabtree, who frequently observed, that <qs/>"if those children were shut up in a dark room alone, with nothing to do, they would still find some way of being mischievous, and of deserving to be punished."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="holiday.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="holiday.c1.s24"><qs/>"Harry!"<qe/><sls/> said Major Graham one day, <sle/><qs/>"you remind me of a monkey which belonged to the colonel of our regiment formerly.</s> <s sid="25" id="holiday.c1.s25">He was famous for contriving to play all sorts of pranks when no one supposed them to be possible, and I recollect once having a valuable French clock, which the malicious creature seemed particularly determined to break.</s> <s sid="26" id="holiday.c1.s26">Many a time I caught him in the fact, and saved my beautiful clock; but one day, being suddenly summoned out of the room, I hastily fastened his chain to a table, so that he could not possibly, even at the full extent of his paw, so much as touch the glass case.</s> <s sid="27" id="holiday.c1.s27">I observed him impatiently watching my departure, and felt a misgiving that he expected to get the better of me; so after shutting the door, I took a peep through the key-hole, and what do you think Jack had done, Harry? for, next to Mr. Monkey himself, you are certainly the cleverest contriver of mischief I know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="holiday.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="holiday.c1.s28"><qs/>"What did he do?"<qe/><sss/> asked Harry eagerly; <sse/><qs/>"did he throw a stone at the clock?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="holiday.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="holiday.c1.s29"><qs/>"No! but his leg was several inches longer than his arm, so having turned his tail towards his object, he stretched out his hind-paw, and before I could rush back, my splendid alabaster clock had been upset and broken to shivers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="holiday.c1.p13"><s sid="30" id="holiday.c1.s30">Laura soon became quite as mischievous as Harry, which is very surprising, as she was a whole year older, and had been twice as often scolded by Mrs. Crabtree.</s> <s sid="31" id="holiday.c1.s31">Neither of these children intended any harm, for they were only heedless lively romps, who would not for twenty worlds have told a lie, or done a shabby thing, or taken what did not belong to them.</s> <s sid="32" id="holiday.c1.s32">They were not greedy either, and would not on any account have resembled Peter Grey, who was at the same school with Frank, and who spent all his own pocket-money, and borrowed a great deal of other people's, to squander at the pastry-cook's, saying, he wished it were possible to eat three dinners, and two breakfasts, and five suppers every day.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="holiday.c1.p14"><s sid="33" id="holiday.c1.s33">Harry was not a cruel boy either; he never lashed his pony, beat his dog, pinched his sister, or killed any butterflies, though he often chased them for fun, and one day he even defended a wasp, at the risk of being stung, when Mrs. Crabtree intended to kill it.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="holiday.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="holiday.c1.s34"><qs/>"Nasty, useless vermin!"<qe/><sss/> said she angrily, <sse/><qs/>"What business have they in the world! coming into other people's houses, with nothing to do!</s> <s sid="35" id="holiday.c1.s35">They sting and torment every body!</s> <s sid="36" id="holiday.c1.s36">Bees are very different, for they make honey."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="holiday.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="holiday.c1.s37"><qs/>"And wasps make jelly!"<qe/> said Harry resolutely, while he opened the window, and shook the happy wasp out of his pocket handkerchief.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="holiday.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="holiday.c1.s38">Mrs. Crabtree allowed no pets of any description in her territories, and ordered the children to be happy without any such nonsense.</s> <s sid="39" id="holiday.c1.s39">When Laura's canary-bird escaped one unlucky day out of its cage, Mrs. Crabtree was strongly suspected by Major Graham, of having secretly opened the door, as she had long declared war upon bulfinches, white mice, parrots, kittens, dogs, bantams, and gold fish, observing that animals only made a noise and soiled the house, therefore every creature should remain in its own home, <qs/>"birds in the air, fish in the sea, and beasts in the desert."<qe/></s> <s sid="40" id="holiday.c1.s40">She seemed always watching in hopes Harry and Laura might do something that they ought to be punished for; and Mrs. Crabtree certainly had more ears than other people, or slept with one eye open, as, whatever might be done, night or day, she overheard the lowest whisper of mischief, and appeared able to see what was going on in the dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="holiday.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="holiday.c1.s41">When Harry was a very little boy, he sometimes put himself in the corner, after doing wrong, apparently quite sensible that he deserved to be punished, and once, after being terribly scolded by Mrs. Crabtree, he drew in his stool beside her chair, with a funny penitent face, twirling his thumbs over and over each other, and saying, <qs/>"Now, Mrs. Crabtree! look what a good boy I am going to be!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="holiday.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="holiday.c1.s42"><qs/>"You a good boy!"<qe/> replied she contemptuously:</s> <s sid="43" id="holiday.c1.s43"><qs/>"No! no! the world will be turned into a cream-cheese first!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="holiday.c1.p20"><s sid="44" id="holiday.c1.s44">Lady Harriet gave Harry and Laura a closet of their own, in which she allowed them to keep their toys, and nobody could help laughing to see that, amidst the whole collection, there was seldom one unbroken.</s> <s sid="45" id="holiday.c1.s45">Frank wrote out a list once of what he found in this crowded little store-room, and amused himself often with reading it over afterwards.</s> <s sid="46" id="holiday.c1.s46">There were three dolls without faces, a horse with no legs, a drum with a hole in the top, a cart without wheels, a churn with no bottom, a kite without a tale, a skipping-rope with no handles, and a cup and ball that had lost the string.</s> <s sid="47" id="holiday.c1.s47">Lady Harriet called this closet the hospital for decayed toys, and she often employed herself as their doctor, mending legs and arms for soldiers, horses, and dolls, though her skill seldom succeeded long, because play-things must have been made of cast-iron to last a week with Harry.</s> <s sid="48" id="holiday.c1.s48">One cold winter morning when Laura entered the nursery, she found a large fire blazing, and all her wax dolls sitting in a row within the fender staring at the flames.</s> <s sid="49" id="holiday.c1.s49">Harry intended no mischief on this occasion, but great was his vexation when Laura burst into tears, and showed him that their faces were running in a hot stream down upon their beautiful silk frocks, which were completely ruined, and not a doll had its nose remaining.</s> <s sid="50" id="holiday.c1.s50">Another time, Harry pricked a hole in his own beautiful large gas ball, wishing to see how the gas could possibly escape, after which, in a moment, it shrivelled up into a useless empty bladder,--and when his kite was flying up to the clouds, Harry often wished that he could be tied to the tail himself, so as to fly also through the air like a bird, and see every thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="holiday.c1.p21"><s sid="51" id="holiday.c1.s51">Mrs. Crabtree always wore a prodigious bunch of jingling keys in her pocket, that rung whenever she moved, as if she carried a dinner bell in her pocket, and Frank said it was like a rattlesnake giving warning of her approach, which was of great use, as everybody had time to put on a look of good behaviour before she arrived.</s> <s sid="52" id="holiday.c1.s52">Even Betty, the under nursery-maid, felt in terror of Mrs. Crabtree's entrance, and was obliged to work harder than any six house-maids united.</s> <s sid="53" id="holiday.c1.s53">Frank told her one day that he thought brooms might soon be invented, which would go by steam and brush carpets of themselves, but, in the meantime, not a grain of dust could lurk in any corner of the nursery without being dislodged.</s> <s sid="54" id="holiday.c1.s54">Betty would have required ten hands, and twenty pair of feet, to do all the work that was expected; but the grate looked like jet, the windows would not have soiled a cambric handkerchief, and the carpet was switched with so many tea-leaves, that Frank thought Mrs. Crabtree often took several additional cups of tea in order to leave a plentiful supply of leaves for sweeping the floor next morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="holiday.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="holiday.c1.s55">If Laura and Harry left any breakfast, Mrs. Crabtree kept it carefully till dinner time, when they were obliged to finish the whole before tasting meat; and if they refused it at dinner, the remains were kept for supper.</s> <s sid="56" id="holiday.c1.s56">Mrs. Crabtree always informed them that she did it <qs/>"for their good,"<qe/> though Harry never could see any good that it did to either of them; and when she mentioned how many poor children would be glad to eat what they despised, he often wished the hungry beggars had some of his own hot dinner, which he would gladly have spared to them; for Harry was really so generous, that he would have lived upon air, if he might be of use to anybody.</s> <s sid="57" id="holiday.c1.s57">Time passed on, and Lady Harriet engaged a master for some hours a-day to teach the children lessons, while even Mrs. Crabtree found no other fault to Harry and Laura, except that in respect to good behaviour their memories were like a sieve, which let out every thing they were desired to keep in mind.</s> <s sid="58" id="holiday.c1.s58">They seemed always to hope, somehow or other, when Mrs. Crabtree once turned her back, she would never shew her face again; so their promises of better conduct were all <qs/>"wind without rain,"<qe/>--very loud and plenty of them, but no good effect to be seen afterwards.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="holiday.c1.p23"><s sid="59" id="holiday.c1.s59">Among her many other torments, Mrs. Crabtree rolled up Laura's hair every night on all sides of her head, in large stiff curl-papers, till they were as round and hard as walnuts, after which, she tied on a night-cap, as tightly as possible above all, saying this would curl the hair still better.</s> <s sid="60" id="holiday.c1.s60">Laura could not lay any part of her head on the pillow, without suffering so much pain that, night after night, she sat up in bed, after Mrs. Crabtree had bustled out of the room, and quietly took the cruel papers out, though she was punished so severely for doing so, that she obeyed orders at last and lay wide awake half the night with torture; and it was but small comfort to Laura afterwards, that Lady Harriet's visitors frequently admired the forest of long glossy ringlets that adorned her head, and complimented Mrs. Crabtree on the trouble it must cost her to keep that charming hair in order.</s> <s sid="61" id="holiday.c1.s61">Often did Laura wish that it were ornamenting any wig-block, rather than her own head; and one day Lady Harriet laughed heartily, when some strangers admired her little grand-daughter's ringlets, and Laura asked, very anxiously, if they would like to cut off a few of the longest, and keep them for her sake.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="holiday.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="holiday.c1.s62"><qs/>"Your hair does curl like a cork-screw,"<qe/> said Frank, laughing.</s> <s sid="63" id="holiday.c1.s63"><qs/>"If I want to draw a cork out of a beer bottle any day, I shall borrow one of those ringlets, Laura!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="holiday.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="holiday.c1.s64"><qs/>"You may laugh, Frank, for it is fun to you and death to me,"<qe/> answered poor Laura, gravely shaking her curls at him.</s> <s sid="65" id="holiday.c1.s65"><qs/>"I wish we were all bald, like uncle David!</s> <s sid="66" id="holiday.c1.s66">During the night, I cannot lie still on account of those tiresome curls, and all day I dare not stir for fear of spoiling them, so they are never out of my head."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="holiday.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="holiday.c1.s67"><qs/>"Nor off your head!</s> <s sid="68" id="holiday.c1.s68">How pleasant it must be to have Mrs. Crabtree combing and scolding, and scolding and combing, for hours every day!</s> <s sid="69" id="holiday.c1.s69">Poor Laura! we must get Dr. Bell to say that they shall be taken off on pain of death, and then, perhaps, grandmama would order some Irish reapers to cut them down with a sickle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="holiday.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="holiday.c1.s76">Never was there a more amiable, pious, excellent boy than Frank, who read his Bible so attentively, and said his prayers so regularly every morning and evening, that he soon learned both to know his duty and to do it.</s> <s sid="77" id="holiday.c1.s77">Though he laughed heartily at the scrapes which Harry and Laura so constantly fell into, he often also helped them out of their difficulties; being very different from most elderly boys, who find an odd kind of pleasure in teazing younger children--pulling their hair--pinching their arms--twitching away their dinners--and twenty more plans for tormenting, which Frank never attempted to enjoy, but he often gave Harry and Laura a great deal of kind, sober, good advice, which they listened to very attentively while they were in any new distress, but generally forgot again as soon as their spirits rose.</s> <s sid="78" id="holiday.c1.s78">Frank came home only upon Saturdays and Sundays, because he attended during most of the week at Mr. Lexicon's academy, where he gradually became so clever, that the masters all praised his extraordinary attention, and covered him with medals, while Major Graham often filled his pockets with a reward of money, after which he ran towards the nearest shop to spend his little fortune in buying a present for somebody.</s> <s sid="79" id="holiday.c1.s79">Frank scarcely ever wanted anything for himself, but he always wished to contrive some kind generous plan for other people; and Major Graham used to say, <qs/>"if that boy had only sixpence in the world, he would lay it all out on penny tarts to distribute among half-a-dozen of his friends."<qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="holiday.c1.s80">He even saved his pocket-money once, during three whole months, to purchase a gown for Mrs. Crabtree, who looked almost good-humoured during the space of five minutes, when Frank presented it to her, saying, in his joyous merry voice, <qs/>"Mrs. Crabtree!</s> <s sid="81" id="holiday.c1.s81">I wish you health to wear it, strength to tear it, and money to buy another!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="holiday.c2.p3"><s sid="3" id="holiday.c2.s3">Lady Harriet Graham was an extremely thin, delicate, old lady, with a very pale face, and a sweet gentle voice, which the children delighted to hear, for it always spoke kindly to them, and sounded like music, after the loud, rough tones of Mrs. Crabtree.</s> <s sid="4" id="holiday.c2.s4">She wore her own grey hair, which had become almost as white as the widow's cap which covered her head.</s> <s sid="5" id="holiday.c2.s5">The rest of her dress was generally black velvet, and she usually sat in a comfortable arm-chair by the fire-side, watching her grandchildren at play, with a large work-bag by her side, and a prodigious Bible open on the table before her.</s> <s sid="6" id="holiday.c2.s6">Lady Harriet often said that it made her young again to see the joyous gambols of Harry and Laura; and when unable any longer to bear their noise, she sometimes kept them quiet, by telling the most delightful stories about what had happened to herself when she was young.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="holiday.c2.p4"><s sid="7" id="holiday.c2.s7">Once upon a time, however, Lady Harriet suddenly became so very ill, that Dr. Bell said she must spend a few days in the country, for change of air, and accordingly she determined on passing a quiet week at Holiday House with her relations, Lord and Lady Rockville.</s> <s sid="8" id="holiday.c2.s8">Meanwhile, Harry and Laura were to be left under the sole care of Mrs. Crabtree, so it might have been expected that they would both feel more frightened for her, now that she was reigning monarch of the house, than ever.</s> <s sid="9" id="holiday.c2.s9">Harry would obey those he loved, if they only held up a little finger; but all the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, and her cat-o'-nine-tails, were generally forgotten soon after she left the room; therefore he thought little at first about the many threats she held out, if he behaved ill, but he listened most seriously when his dear sick grandmama told him, in a faint weak voice, on the day of her departure from home, how very well he ought to behave in her absence, as no one remained but the maids to keep him in order, and that she hoped Mrs. Crabtree would write her a letter full of good news about his excellent conduct.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="holiday.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="holiday.c2.s10">Harry felt as if he would gladly sit still without stirring, till his grandmama came back, if that could only please her; and there never was any one more determined to be a good boy than he, at the moment when Lady Harriet's carriage came round to the door.</s> <s sid="11" id="holiday.c2.s11">Laura, Frank, and Harry helped to carry all the pillows, boxes, books, and baskets which were necessary for the journey, of which there seemed to be about fifty; then they arranged the cushions as comfortably as possible, and watched very sorrowfully when their grandmama, after kindly embracing them both, was carefully supported by Major Graham and her maid Harrison, into the chariot.</s> <s sid="12" id="holiday.c2.s12">Uncle David gave each of the children a pretty picture-book before taking leave, and said, as he was stepping into the carriage, <qs/>"Now, children!</s> <s sid="13" id="holiday.c2.s13">I have only one piece of serious, important advice to give you all, so attend to me!--never crack nuts with your teeth!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="holiday.c2.p6"><s sid="14" id="holiday.c2.s14">When the carriage had driven off, Mrs. Crabtree became so busy scolding Betty, and storming at Jack the foot-boy, for not cleaning her shoes well enough, that she left Harry and Laura standing in the passage, not knowing exactly what they ought to do first, and Frank, seeing them looking rather melancholy and bewildered at the loss of their grandmama, stopped a moment as he passed on the way to school, and said in a very kind, affectionate voice,</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="holiday.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="holiday.c2.s15"><qs/>"Now, Harry and Laura, listen both of you!--here is a grand opportunity to show everybody, that we can be trusted to ourselves, without getting into any scrapes, so that if grandmama is ever ill again, and obliged to go away, she need not feel so sad and anxious as she did to-day.</s> <s sid="16" id="holiday.c2.s16">I mean to become nine times more attentive to my lessons than usual this morning, to show how trust-worthy we are, and if you are wise, pray march straight up to the nursery yourselves.</s> <s sid="17" id="holiday.c2.s17">I have arranged a gown and cap of Mrs. Crabtree's on the large arm-chair, to look as like herself as possible, that you may be reminded how soon she will come back, and you must not behave like the mice when the cat is out.</s> <s sid="18" id="holiday.c2.s18">Good bye!</s> <s sid="19" id="holiday.c2.s19">Say the alphabet backward, and count your fingers for half-an-hour, but when Mrs. Crabtree appears again, pray do not jump out of the window for joy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="holiday.c2.p8"><s sid="20" id="holiday.c2.s20">Harry and Laura were proceeding directly towards the nursery, as Frank had recommended, when unluckily they observed in passing the drawing-room door, that it was wide open; so Harry peeped in, and they began idly wandering round the tables and cabinets.</s> <s sid="21" id="holiday.c2.s21">Not ten minutes elapsed before they both commenced racing about as if they were mad, perfectly screaming with joy, and laughing so loudly at their own funny tricks, that an old gentleman who lived next door, very nearly sent in a message to ask what the joke was.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="holiday.c2.p9"><s sid="22" id="holiday.c2.s22">Presently Harry and Laura ran up and down stairs till the housemaid was quite fatigued with running after them.</s> <s sid="23" id="holiday.c2.s23">They jumped upon the fine damask sofas in the drawing-room, stirred the fire till it was in a blaze, and rushed out on the balcony, upsetting one or two geraniums and a myrtle.</s> <s sid="24" id="holiday.c2.s24">They spilt Lady Harriet's perfumes over their handkerchiefs,--they looked into all the beautiful books of pictures,--they tumbled many of the pretty Dresden china figures on the floor,--they wound up the little French clock till it was broken,--they made the musical work-box play its tunes, and set the Chinese mandarins nodding, till they very nearly nodded their heads off.</s> <s sid="25" id="holiday.c2.s25">In short, so much mischief has seldom been done in so short a time, till at last Harry, perfectly worn out with laughing and running, threw himself into a large arm-chair, and Laura, with her ringlets tumbling in frightful confusion over her face, and the beads of her coral necklace rolling on the floor, tossed herself into a sofa beside him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="holiday.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="holiday.c2.s26"><qs/>"Oh! what fun!"<qe/><sls/> cried Harry, in an ecstacy of delight; <sle/><qs/>"I wish Frank had been here, and crowds of little boys and girls, to play with us all day!</s> <s sid="27" id="holiday.c2.s27">It would be a good joke, Laura, to write and ask all our little cousins and companions to drink tea here to-morrow evening!</s> <s sid="28" id="holiday.c2.s28">Their mamas could never guess we had not leave from grandmama to invite everybody, so I dare say we might gather quite a large party! oh! how enchanting!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="holiday.c2.p11"><s sid="29" id="holiday.c2.s29">Laura laughed heartily when she heard this proposal of Harry's, and without hesitating a moment about it, she joyously placed herself before Lady Harriet's writing-table, and scribbled a multitude of little notes, in large text, to more than twenty young friends, all of whom had at other times been asked by Lady Harriet to spend the evening with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="holiday.c2.p12"><s sid="30" id="holiday.c2.s30">Laura felt very much puzzled to know what was usually said in a card of invitation, but after many consultations, she and Harry thought at last, that it was very nicely expressed, for they wrote these words upon a large sheet of paper to each of their friends:--</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="holiday.c2.p13"><s sid="31" id="holiday.c2.s31">Master Harry Graham and Miss Laura wish you to have the honour of drinking tea with us to-morrow, at six o'clock.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="holiday.c2.p14"><s sid="32" id="holiday.c2.s32">(Signed) Harry and Laura.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="holiday.c2.p15"><s sid="33" id="holiday.c2.s33">Laura afterwards singed a hole in her muslin frock, while lighting one of the Vesta matches to seal these numerous notes; and Harry dropped some burning sealing-wax on his hand, in the hurry of assisting her; but he thought that little accident no matter, and ran away to see if the cards could be sent off immediately.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="holiday.c2.p16"><s sid="34" id="holiday.c2.s34">Now, there lived in the house a very old footman, called Andrew, who remembered Harry and Laura since they were quite little babies; and he often looked exceedingly sad and sorry when they suffered punishment from Mrs. Crabtree.</s> <s sid="35" id="holiday.c2.s35">He was ready to do anything in the world when it pleased the children, and would have carried a message to the moon, if they had only shown him the way.</s> <s sid="36" id="holiday.c2.s36">Many odd jobs and private messages he had already been employed in by Harry, who now called Andrew up stairs, entreating him to carry out all those absurd notes as fast as possible, and to deliver them immediately, as they were of the greatest consequence.</s> <s sid="37" id="holiday.c2.s37">Upon hearing this, old Andrew lost not a moment, but threw on his hat, and instantly started off, looking like the twopenny postman, he carried such a prodigious parcel of invitations, while Harry and Laura stood at the drawing-room window, almost screaming with joy when they saw him set out, and when they observed that, to oblige them, he actually ran along the street at a sort of trot, which was as fast as he could possibly go.</s> <s sid="38" id="holiday.c2.s38">Presently, however, he certainly did stop for a single minute, and Laura saw that it was in order to take a peep into one of the notes, that he might ascertain what they were all about; but as he never carried any letters without doing so, she thought that quite natural, and was only very glad when he had finished, and rapidly pursued his way again.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="holiday.c2.p17"><s sid="39" id="holiday.c2.s39">Next morning, Mrs. Crabtree and Betty became very much surprised to observe what a number of smart livery servants knocked at the street door, and gave in cards, but their astonishment became still greater, when old Andrew brought up a whole parcel of them to Harry and Laura, who immediately broke the seals, and read the contents in a corner together.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="holiday.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="holiday.c2.s40"><qs/>"What are you about there, Master Graham?"<qe/><sss/> cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily, <sse/><qs/>"how dare any body venture to touch your grandmama's letters?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="holiday.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="holiday.c2.s41"><qs/>"They are not for grandmama!--they are all for us!--every one of them!"<qe/> answered Harry, dancing about the room with joy, and waving the notes over his head.</s> <s sid="42" id="holiday.c2.s42"><qs/>"Look at this direction!</s> <s sid="43" id="holiday.c2.s43">For Master and Miss Graham! put on your spectacles, and read it yourself, Mrs. Crabtree!</s> <s sid="44" id="holiday.c2.s44">What delightful fun! the house will be as full as an egg!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="holiday.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="holiday.c2.s45">Mrs. Crabtree seemed completely puzzled what to think of all this, and looked so much as if she did not know exactly what to be angry at, and so ready to be in a passion if possible, that Harry burst out a laughing, while he said, <qs/>"Only think Mrs. Crabtree! here is every body coming to tea with us!--all my cousins, besides Peter Grey, Robert Stewart, Charles Forrester, Adelaide Cunninghame, Diana Wentworth, John Fordyce, Edmund Ashford, Frank Abercromby, Ned Russel, and Tom ----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="holiday.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="holiday.c2.s46"><qs/>"The boy is distracted!"<qe/> exclaimed Betty, staring with astonishment.</s> <s sid="47" id="holiday.c2.s47"><qs/>"What does all this mean, Master Harry?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="holiday.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="holiday.c2.s48"><qs/>"And who gave you leave to invite company into your grandmama's house?"<qe/> cried Mrs. Crabtree, snatching up all the notes, and angrily thrusting them into the fire.</s> <s sid="49" id="holiday.c2.s49"><qs/>"I never heard of such things in all my life before, Master Harry! but as sure as eggs is eggs, you shall repent of this, for not one morsel of cake, or anything else shall you have to give any of the party; no! not so much as a crust of bread, or a thimbleful of tea!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="holiday.c2.p23"><s sid="50" id="holiday.c2.s50">Harry and Laura had never thought of such a catastrophe as this before; they always saw a great table covered with every thing that could be named for tea, whenever their little friends came to visit them, and whether it rose out of the floor, or was brought by Aladdin's lamp, they never considered it possible that the table would not be provided as usual on such occasions, so this terrible speech of Mrs. Crabtree's frightened them out of their wits.</s> <s sid="51" id="holiday.c2.s51">What was to be done!</s> <s sid="52" id="holiday.c2.s52">They both knew by experience that she always did whatever she threatened, or something a great deal worse, so they began by bursting into tears, and begging Mrs. Crabtree for this once to excuse them, and to give some cakes and tea to their little visitors, but they might as well have spoken to one of the Chinese mandarins, for she only shook her head, with a positive look, declaring over and over again that nothing should appear upon the table except what was always brought up for their own supper--two biscuits and two cups of milk.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="holiday.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="holiday.c2.s53"><qs/>"Therefore say no more about it!"<qe/> added she, sternly.</s> <s sid="54" id="holiday.c2.s54"><qs/>"I am your best friend, Master Harry, trying to teach you and Miss Laura your duty, so save your breath to cool your porridge."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="holiday.c2.p25"><s sid="55" id="holiday.c2.s55">Poor Harry and Laura looked perfectly ill with fright and vexation when they thought of what was to happen next, while Mrs. Crabtree sat down to her knitting, grumbling to herself, and dropping her stitches every minute with rage and irritation.</s> <s sid="56" id="holiday.c2.s56">Old Andrew felt exceedingly sorry after he heard what distress and difficulty Harry was in, and when the hour for the party approached, he very good-naturedly spread out a large table in the dining-room, where he put down as many cups, saucers, plates, and spoons as Laura chose to direct; but in spite of all his trouble, though it looked very grand, there was nothing whatever to eat or drink, except the two dry biscuits, and the two miserable cups of milk, which seemed to become smaller every time that Harry looked at them.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="holiday.c2.p26"><s sid="57" id="holiday.c2.s57">Presently the clock struck six, and Harry listened to the hour very much as a prisoner would do in the condemned cell in Newgate, feeling that the dreaded time was at last arrived.</s> <s sid="58" id="holiday.c2.s58">Soon afterwards, several handsome carriages drove up to the door filled with little Masters and Misses, who hurried joyfully into the house, talking and laughing all the way up stairs, being evidently quite happy at coming out to tea, while poor Harry and Laura almost wished the floor would open and swallow them up, so they shrunk into a distant corner of the room, quite ashamed to show their faces.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="holiday.c2.p27"><s sid="59" id="holiday.c2.s59">The young ladies were all dressed in their best frocks, with pink sashes, and pink shoes; while the little boys appeared in their holiday clothes, with their hair newly brushed, and their faces washed.</s> <s sid="60" id="holiday.c2.s60">The whole party had dined at two o'clock, so they were as hungry as hawks, looking eagerly round, whenever they entered, to see what was on the tea-table, and evidently surprised that nothing had yet been put down.</s> <s sid="61" id="holiday.c2.s61">Laura and Harry soon afterwards heard their visitors whispering to each other about Norwich buns, rice cakes, spunge biscuits, and maccaroons; while Peter Grey was loud in praise of a party at George Lorraine's the night before, where an immense plum-cake had been sugared over like a snow storm, and covered with crowds of beautiful amusing mottoes; not to mention a quantity of noisy crackers, that exploded like pistols; besides which, a glass of hot jelly had been handed to each little guest before he was sent home.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="holiday.c2.p28"><s sid="62" id="holiday.c2.s62">Every time the door opened, all eyes were anxiously turned round, expecting a grand feast to be brought in; but quite the contrary--it was only Andrew showing up more hungry visitors; while Harry felt so unspeakably wretched, that, if some kind fairy could only have turned him into a Norwich bun at the moment, he would gladly have consented to be cut in pieces, that his ravenous guests might be satisfied.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="holiday.c2.p29"><s sid="63" id="holiday.c2.s63">Charles Forrester was a particularly good-natured boy, so Harry at last took courage and beckoned him into a remote corner of the room, where he confessed, in whispers, the real state of affairs about tea, and how sadly distressed he and Laura felt, because they had nothing whatever to give among so many visitors, seeing that Mrs. Crabtree kept her determination of affording them no provisions.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="holiday.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="holiday.c2.s64"><qs/>"What is to be done!"<qe/> said Charles, very anxiously, as he felt extremely sorry for his little friends.</s> <s sid="65" id="holiday.c2.s65"><qs/>"If Mama had been at home, she would gladly have sent whatever you liked for tea, but unluckily she is dining out!</s> <s sid="66" id="holiday.c2.s66">I saw a loaf of bread lying on a table at home this evening, which she would make you quite welcome to!</s> <s sid="67" id="holiday.c2.s67">Shall I run home, as fast as possible, to fetch it?</s> <s sid="68" id="holiday.c2.s68">That would, at any rate, be better than nothing!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="holiday.c2.p31"><s sid="69" id="holiday.c2.s69">Poor Charles Forrester was very lame, therefore, while he talked of running he could hardly walk, but Lady Forrester's house stood so near, that he soon reached home, when, snatching up the loaf, he hurried back towards the street with his prize, quite delighted to see how large and substantial it looked.</s> <s sid="70" id="holiday.c2.s70">Scarcely had he reached the door, however, before the housekeeper ran hastily out, saying,</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="holiday.c2.p32" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="holiday.c2.s71"><qs/>"Stop, Mr. Charles! stop! sure you are not running away with the loaf for my tea, and the parrot must have her supper too.</s> <s sid="72" id="holiday.c2.s72">What do you want with that there bread?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="holiday.c2.p33" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="holiday.c2.s73"><qs/>"Never mind, Mrs. Comfit!"<qe/><sls/> answered Charles, hastening on faster than ever, while he grasped the precious loaf more firmly in his hand, and limped along at a prodigious rate, <sle/><qs/>"Polly is getting too fat, so she will be the better of fasting for this one day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="holiday.c3.p5"><s sid="10" id="holiday.c3.s10">Presently Betty ran breathlessly into the room, saying that Mrs. Crabtree ought to come down stairs immediately, as Lady Harriet had been suddenly taken very ill, and, till the Doctor arrived, nobody knew what to do, so she must give her advice and assistance.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="holiday.c3.p19"><s sid="48" id="holiday.c3.s48">Up flew Mrs. Crabtree towards the nursery like a sky-rocket, scolding furiously, talking louder than all the others put together, and asking who had set the house on fire, while Harry and Laura scarcely knew whether to be most frightened for the raging flames, or the raging Mrs. Crabtree; but, in the meantime, they both shrunk into the smallest possible size, and hid themselves behind a door.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="holiday.c3.p20"><s sid="49" id="holiday.c3.s49">During all this confusion, Old Andrew luckily remembered, that, in the morning, there had been a great washing in the laundry, where large tubs full of water were standing, so he called to the few maids who had any of their senses remaining, desiring them to assist in carrying up some buckets, that they might be emptied on the burning beds, to extinguish the flames if possible.</s> <s sid="50" id="holiday.c3.s50">Every body was now in a hurry, and all elbowing each other out of the way, while it was most extraordinary to see how old Andrew exerted himself, as if he had been a fireman all his life, while Mrs. Marmalade, the fat cook, who could hardly carry herself up stairs in general, actively assisted to bring up the great heavy tubs, and to pour them out like a cascade upon the burning curtains, till the nursery-floor looked like a duck pond.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="holiday.c3.p21"><s sid="51" id="holiday.c3.s51">Meantime Harry and Laura added to the confusion as much as they could, and were busier than anybody, stealing down the back-stairs whenever Mrs. Crabtree was not in sight, and filling their little jugs with water, which they brought up, as fast as possible, and dashed upon the flames, till at last, it is to be feared, they began to feel quite amused with the bustle, and to be almost sorry when the conflagration diminished.</s> <s sid="52" id="holiday.c3.s52">At one time, Laura very nearly set her own frock on fire, as she ventured too near, but Harry pulled her back, and then courageously advanced to discharge a shower from his own little jug, remaining stationary to watch the effect, till his face was almost scorched.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="holiday.c3.p22"><s sid="53" id="holiday.c3.s53">At last the fire became less and less, till it went totally out, but not before the nursery furniture had been reduced to perfect ruins, besides which, Betty had her arm sadly burned in the confusion.</s> <s sid="54" id="holiday.c3.s54">Mrs. Marmalade's cap was completely destroyed, and Mrs. Crabtree's best gown had so large a hole burned in the skirt, that she never could wear it again!</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="holiday.c3.p23"><s sid="55" id="holiday.c3.s55">After all was quiet, and the fire completely extinguished, Major Graham took Laura down stairs to Lady Harriet's dressing-room, that she might tell the whole particulars of how this alarming accident happened in the nursery, for nobody could guess what had caused so sudden and dreadful a fire, which seemed to have been as unexpected as a flash of lightning.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="holiday.c3.p24"><s sid="56" id="holiday.c3.s56">Lady Harriet had felt so terrified by the noise and confusion, that she was out of bed, sitting up in an arm-chair, supported by pillows, when Laura entered, at the sight of whom, with her well-cropped head, she made an exclamation of perfect amazement.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="holiday.c3.p44" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="holiday.c3.s96">When Major Graham chose to exert his voice, it was as loud as a trumpet, and could be heard half a mile off; so he now called out, like thunder, from the top of the stairs to the bottom, saying, <qs/>"Hollo, Harry! hollo!</s> <s sid="97" id="holiday.c3.s97">Come here, my boy!</s> <s sid="98" id="holiday.c3.s98">Nobody shall hurt you!</s> <s sid="99" id="holiday.c3.s99">Harry! where are you!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="holiday.c3.p46"><s sid="101" id="holiday.c3.s101">By this time Lady Harriet nearly fainted with fatigue, for she was so very old, and had been ill all day; so she grew worse and worse, till everybody said she must go to bed, and try if it would be possible to fall asleep, assuring her that Harry must soon be found, as nothing particular could have happened to him, or some person would have seen it.</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="holiday.c5.p87"><s sid="216" id="holiday.c5.s216">Here Laura saw many things which entertained her extremely, for she had scarcely ever seen more of the country than was to be enjoyed with Mrs. Crabtree in Charlotte Square.</s> <s sid="217" id="holiday.c5.s217">The punctual crows were all returning home at their usual hour for the evening, and looked like a black shower over her head, while hundreds of them seemed trying to make a concert at once; the robins hopped close to her feet, evidently accustomed to be fed; a tame pheasant, as fat as a London alderman, came up the steps to keep her company; and the peacock, spreading his tail, and strutting about, looked the very picture of silly pride and vanity.</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="holiday.c5.p88"><s sid="218" id="holiday.c5.s218">Laura admired and enjoyed all this extremely, and crumbled down nearly a loaf of bread, which she scattered on the ground, in order to be popular among her visitors, who took all they could get from her, and quarrelled among themselves about it, very much as boys and girls would perhaps have done in the same circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="holiday.c5.p91"><s sid="223" id="holiday.c5.s223">Laura, as usual, did not wait to reflect what her grandmama might be likely to think; indeed it is to be feared Laura forgot at the moment that she had a grandmama at all, for her mind was never large enough to hold more than one thing at a time, and now it was entirely filled with the flock of geese.</s> <s sid="224" id="holiday.c5.s224">She instantly set off in pursuit of them, and began chasing the whole party across the park, making all sorts of dreadful noises, in hopes they might fly; but, on the contrary, they held up their heads, as if she had been a dancing-master, and marched slowly on, cackling loudly to each other, and evidently getting extremely angry.</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="holiday.c5.p92"><s sid="225" id="holiday.c5.s225">Laura was now quite close to her new acquaintances, and even threw a pebble to hurry them forward, when suddenly an old gander stopped, and turned round in a terrible rage.</s> <s sid="226" id="holiday.c5.s226">The whole flock of geese then did the same, after which they flew towards Laura, with their bills wide open, hissing furiously, and stretching out their long necks in an angry menacing way, as if they wished to tear her in pieces.</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="holiday.c5.p93"><s sid="227" id="holiday.c5.s227">Poor Laura became frightened out of any wits she ever had, and ran off, with all the geese after her!</s> <s sid="228" id="holiday.c5.s228">Anybody must have laughed into fits, could they have heard what a triumphant cackle the geese set up, and had they seen how fast she flew away.</s> <s sid="229" id="holiday.c5.s229">If Laura had borrowed a pair of wings from her pursuers, she could scarcely have got more quickly on.</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="holiday.c5.p94"><s sid="230" id="holiday.c5.s230">In the hurry of escaping, she always looked back to see if the enemy followed, and scarcely observed which way she ran herself, till suddenly her foot stumbled over a large stone, and she fell headlong into the river!--oh, what a scream Laura gave! it terrified even the old gander himself, and sent the whole flock of geese marching off, nearly as fast as they had come; but Laura's cries also reached, at a great distance, the ears of somebody, who she would have been very sorry to think had heard them.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="holiday.c7.p23"><s sid="54" id="holiday.c7.s54">Lady Rockville privately recommended Harry and Laura to sit quietly down and play at cat's cradle, which accordingly they did, and when that became no longer endurable, some dominos were produced.</s> <s sid="55" id="holiday.c7.s55">Thus the morning wore tediously away till about two o'clock, when suddenly the rain stopped, the sun burst forth with prodigious splendour, every leaf in the park glittered, as if it had been sprinkled with diamonds, and a hundred birds seemed singing a chorus of joy, while bees and butterflies fluttered at the windows and flew away rejoicing.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="holiday.c7.p28" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="holiday.c7.s72">Laura's knees tottered under her, and she instantly dropped on the ground with terror, feeling as if she would die the next minute of fright, while, as for attempting to escape, it never entered her head to think that possible.</s> <s sid="73" id="holiday.c7.s73">Harry felt quite differently, for he was a bold boy, not easily scared out of his senses, and instantly saw that something must be done, or they would both be lost.</s> <s sid="74" id="holiday.c7.s74">Many selfish people would have run away alone, without caring for the safety of any one but themselves, which was not at all the case with Harry, who thought first of his poor frightened companion.</s> <s sid="75" id="holiday.c7.s75"><qs/>"Hollo, Laura! are you hiding in a cart rut?"<qe/> he exclaimed, pulling her hastily off the ground.</s> <s sid="76" id="holiday.c7.s76"><qs/>"The bull will soon find you there!</s> <s sid="77" id="holiday.c7.s77">Come! come! as fast as possible! we must have a race for it yet!</s> <s sid="78" id="holiday.c7.s78">That terrible beast can scarcely make his way through the trees and branches, they grow so closely!</s> <s sid="79" id="holiday.c7.s79">Perhaps we may get on as fast as he!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="holiday.c7.p29"><s sid="80" id="holiday.c7.s80">All this time, Harry was dragging Laura along, and running himself into the thickest part of the plantation; but it was very difficult to make any progress, as she had become quite faint and bewildered with fright.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="holiday.c7.p32"><s sid="86" id="holiday.c7.s86">Laura felt so grateful to Harry when he said this, that she seemed for a moment almost to forget the bull, which was still coming furiously on behind, while she now made a desperate exertion to run faster than she had been able to do before, clearing the ground almost as rapidly as Harry could have done, though he still held her firmly by the hand, to encourage her.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="holiday.c7.p33"><s sid="87" id="holiday.c7.s87">The trampling noise continued, the breaking of branches, and the frightful bellowing of this dreadful animal, when at last Harry caught sight of a wooden paling, which he silently pointed out to Laura, being quite unable now to speak.</s> <s sid="88" id="holiday.c7.s88">Having rushed forward to it, with almost frantic haste, Harry threw himself over the top, after which he helped Laura to squeeze herself through underneath, when they proceeded rather more leisurely onwards.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="holiday.c7.p36"><s sid="93" id="holiday.c7.s93">Harry now began to fear that indeed all was over, for his strength had become nearly exhausted, when, to his great joy, he espied a large, rough stone wall, not very far off, which was as welcome a sight as land to a shipwrecked sailor.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="holiday.c8.p31"><s sid="75" id="holiday.c8.s75">As this very large vehicle was drawn by only one horse, it proceeded very slowly; but Mrs. Darwin amused the children with several very diverting stories, and gave them a grand luncheon in the carriage; after which, they threw what was left, wrapped up in an old newspaper, to some people breaking stones on the road, feeling quite delighted to see the surprise and joy of the poor labourers when they opened the parcel.</s> <s sid="76" id="holiday.c8.s76">In short, everybody became sorry when this diverting journey was finished, and they drove up, at last, to the gate of a tall old house, that looked as if it had been built in the year one.</s> <s sid="77" id="holiday.c8.s77">The walls were very thick, and quite mouldy with age.</s> <s sid="78" id="holiday.c8.s78">Indeed, the only wonder was, that Ivy Lodge had still a roof upon its head, for every thing about it looked so tottering and decayed.</s> <s sid="79" id="holiday.c8.s79">The very servants were all old; and a white-headed butler opened the door, who looked as frail and gloomy as the house; but before long, the old walls of Ivy Lodge rung and echoed again with sounds of mirth and joy.</s> <s sid="80" id="holiday.c8.s80">It seemed to have been built on purpose for hide and seek; there were rooms with invisible doors, and closets cut in the walls, and great old chests where people might have been buried alive for a year, without being found out.</s> <s sid="81" id="holiday.c8.s81">The gardens, too, were perfectly enchanting.</s> <s sid="82" id="holiday.c8.s82">Such arbours to take strawberries and cream in! and such summer-houses, where they drank tea out of doors every evening!</s> <s sid="83" id="holiday.c8.s83">Here they saw a prodigious eagle, fastened to the ground by a chain, and looking the most dull, melancholy creature in the world; while Harry wished the poor bird might be liberated, and thought how delightful it would be to stand by and see him soaring away to his native skies.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="holiday.c8.p32" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="holiday.c8.s84"><qs/>"Yes! with a large slice of raw meat in his beak!"<qe/> said Peter Grey, who was always thinking of eating.</s> <s sid="85" id="holiday.c8.s85"><qs/>"I dare say he lives much better here, than he would do killing his own mutton up in the clouds there, or taking his chance of a dead horse on the sea-shore occasionally."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="holiday.c8.p33"><s sid="86" id="holiday.c8.s86">Harry and Peter were particularly amused with Mrs. Darwin's curious collection of pets.</s> <s sid="87" id="holiday.c8.s87">There were black swans with red bills, swimming gracefully in a pond close to the window, and ready to rush forward on the shortest notice, for a morsel of bread.</s> <s sid="88" id="holiday.c8.s88">The lop-eared rabbits also surprised them, with their ears hanging down to the ground, and they were interested to see a pair of carrier-pigeons which could carry letters as well as the postman.</s> <s sid="89" id="holiday.c8.s89">Mrs. Darwin showed them tumbler pigeons too, that performed a summerset in the air when they flew, and horsemen and dragoon pigeons, trumpeters and pouters, till Peter Grey at last begged to see the pigeons that made the pigeon-pies, and the cow that gave the butter-milk; he was likewise very anxious for leave to bring his fishing-rod into the drawing-room, to try whether he could catch one of the beautiful gold-fish that swam about in a large glass globe, saying he thought it might perhaps be very good to eat at breakfast.</s> <s sid="90" id="holiday.c8.s90">Mrs. Darwin had a pet lamb that she was exceedingly fond of, because it followed her everywhere, and Harry, who was very fond of the little creature, said he wished some plan could be invented to hinder its ever growing into a great fat vulgar sheep; and he thought the white mice were old animals that had grown grey with years.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="holiday.c8.p34"><s sid="91" id="holiday.c8.s91">There were donkies for the children to ride upon, and Mrs. Darwin had a boat that held the whole party, to sail in, round the pond, and she hung up a swing that seemed to fly about as high as the house, which they swung upon, after which they were allowed to shake the fruit-trees, and to eat whatever came down about their ears; so it very often rained apples and pears in the gardens at Ivy Lodge, for Peter seemed never to tire of that joke; indeed the apple-trees had a sad life of it as long as he remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="holiday.c8.p35" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="holiday.c8.s92">Peter told Mrs. Darwin that he had <qs/>"a patent appetite,"<qe/> which was always ready on every occasion; but the good lady became so fond of stuffing the children at all hours, that even he felt a little puzzled sometimes how to dispose of all she heaped upon his plate, while both Harry and Laura, who were far from greedy, became perfectly wearied of hearing the gong.</s> <s sid="93" id="holiday.c8.s93">The whole party assembled at eight every morning, to partake of porridge and butter-milk, after which, at ten, they breakfasted with Mrs. Darwin on tea, muffins, and sweetmeats.</s> <s sid="94" id="holiday.c8.s94">They then drove in the round open car, to bathe in the sea, on their return from which, luncheon was always ready, and after concluding that, they might pass the interval till dinner among the fruit-trees.</s> <s sid="95" id="holiday.c8.s95">They never could eat enough to please Mrs. Darwin at dinner; tea followed, on a most substantial plan; their supper consisted of poached eggs, and the maid was desired to put a biscuit under every visitor's pillow, in case the young people should be hungry in the night, for Mrs. Darwin said she had been starved at school herself, when she was a little girl, and wished nobody ever to suffer, as she had done, from hunger.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="holiday.c8.p36"><s sid="96" id="holiday.c8.s96">The good lady was so anxious for everything to be exactly as the children liked it, that sometimes Laura felt quite at a loss what to say or do.</s> <s sid="97" id="holiday.c8.s97">One day, having cracked her egg-shell at breakfast, Mrs. Darwin peeped anxiously over her shoulder, saying,</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="holiday.c8.p41" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="holiday.c8.s103"><qs/>"I have seen the eggs much larger than that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="holiday.c8.p42" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="holiday.c8.s104"><qs/>"Yes! but then I believe they are rather coarse,--at least we think so, when Mrs. Crabtree gives us a turkey egg at dinner."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="holiday.c8.p46" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="holiday.c8.s109"><qs/>"No! they are better well boiled!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="holiday.c8.p54"><s sid="118" id="holiday.c8.s118">This long-continued attack upon her egg was too much for Laura's gravity, who appeared for some minutes to have a violent fit of coughing, and ending in a burst of laughter, after which she hastily finished all that remained of it, and thus ended the discussion.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="holiday.c8.p55" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="holiday.c8.s119">In the midst of all their happiness, while the children thought that every succeeding day had no fault but being too short, and Harry even planned with Peter to stop the clock altogether, and see whether time itself would not stand still, nobody ever thought for a moment of anything but joy; and yet a very sad and sudden distress awaited Mrs. Darwin.</s> <s sid="120" id="holiday.c8.s120">One forenoon she received a letter that seemed very hastily and awkwardly folded,--the seal was all to one side, and surrounded with stray drops of red wax,--the direction appeared sadly blotted, and at the top was written in large letters, the words, <qs/>"To be delivered immediately."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="holiday.c8.p56"><s sid="121" id="holiday.c8.s121">When Mrs. Darwin hurriedly tore open this very strange-looking letter, she found that it came from her own housekeeper in town, to announce the dreadful event that her sister, Lady Barnet, had been that day seized with an apoplectic fit, and was thought to be at the point of death, therefore it was hoped that Mrs. Darwin would not lose an hour in returning to town, that she might be present on the melancholy occasion.</s> <s sid="122" id="holiday.c8.s122">The shock of hearing this news was so very great, that poor Mrs. Darwin could not speak about it, but after trying to compose herself for a few minutes, she went into the play-room, and told the children that, for reasons she could not explain, they must get ready to return home in an hour, when the car would be at the door for their journey.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="holiday.c8.p57"><s sid="123" id="holiday.c8.s123">Nothing could exceed their surprise on hearing Mrs. Darwin make such an unexpected proposal.</s> <s sid="124" id="holiday.c8.s124">At first Peter Grey thought she was speaking in jest, and said he would prefer if she ordered out a balloon to travel in, this morning; but when it appeared that Mrs. Darwin was really in earnest about their pleasant visit being over so soon, Harry's face grew perfectly red with passion, while he said in a loud angry voice,</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="holiday.c8.p61"><s sid="135" id="holiday.c8.s135">As long as Mrs. Crabtree continued to scold and rave behind the door, Harry grew harder and harder; but at length the good old lady, Mrs. Darwin herself, arrived up stairs, and represented how ungrateful he was, not doing all in his power to please her, when she had taken so much pains to make him happy.</s> <s sid="136" id="holiday.c8.s136">This brought the little rebel round in a moment, as he became quite sensible of his own misconduct, and resolved immediately to submit.</s> <s sid="137" id="holiday.c8.s137">Accordingly, Harry tried to open the door, but, what is very easily done cannot sometimes be undone, which turned out the case on this occasion, as, with all his exertions, the key would not turn in the lock!</s> <s sid="138" id="holiday.c8.s138">Harry tried it first one way, then another.</s> <s sid="139" id="holiday.c8.s139">He twisted with his whole strength, till his face became perfectly scarlet with the effort, but in vain!</s> <s sid="140" id="holiday.c8.s140">At last he put the poker through the handle of the key, thinking this a very clever plan, and quite sure to succeed, but after a desperate struggle, the unfortunate key broke in two, so then nobody could possibly open the door!</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="holiday.c8.p62"><s sid="141" id="holiday.c8.s141">After this provoking accident happened, Harry felt what a very bad boy he had been, so he burst into tears, and called through the key-hole to beg Mrs. Darwin's pardon, while Mrs. Crabtree scolded him through the key-hole in return, till Harry shrunk away as if a cannonading had begun at his ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="holiday.c8.p63"><s sid="142" id="holiday.c8.s142">Meantime, Mrs. Darwin hurried off, racking her brains to think what had best be done to deliver the prisoner, since no time could be lost, or she might perhaps not get to town at all that night, and the car was expected every minute, to come round for the travellers.</s> <s sid="143" id="holiday.c8.s143">The gardener said he thought it might be possible to find a few ladders, which, being tied one above another, would perhaps reach as high as the window, where Harry had now appeared, and by which he could easily scramble down; so the servants made haste to fetch all they could find, and to borrow all they could see, till a great many were collected.</s> <s sid="144" id="holiday.c8.s144">These they joined together very strongly with ropes, but when it was at last reared against the wall, to the great disappointment of Mrs. Darwin, the ladder appeared a yard and a-half too short!</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="holiday.c8.p72"><s sid="167" id="holiday.c8.s167">There was no time for more than half a scold from Mrs. Crabtree, as Mrs. Darwin's car had been waiting some time; so Harry said she might be owing him the rest, on some future occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="holiday.c9.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="holiday.c9.s9">Whenever Master No-book spoke, it was always to ask for something, and you might continually hear him say, in a whining tone of voice, <qs/>"Papa! may I take this piece of cake?</s> <s sid="10" id="holiday.c9.s10">Aunt Sarah! will you give me an apple?</s> <s sid="11" id="holiday.c9.s11">Mama! do send me the whole of that plum-pudding!"<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="holiday.c9.s12">Indeed, very frequently when he did not get permission to gormandize, this naughty glutton helped himself without leave.</s> <s sid="13" id="holiday.c9.s13">Even his dreams were like his waking hours, for he had often a horrible night-mare about lessons, thinking that he was smothered with Greek Lexicons, or pelted out of the school with a shower of English Grammars, while one night, he fancied himself sitting down to devour an enormous plum-cake, and that all on a sudden it became transformed into a Latin Dictionary!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="holiday.c9.p4"><s sid="14" id="holiday.c9.s14">One afternoon, Master No-book, having played truant all day from school, was lolling on his mama's best sofa in the drawing-room, with his leather boots tucked up on the satin cushions, and nothing to do but to suck a few oranges, and nothing to think of but how much sugar to put upon them, when suddenly an event took place which filled him with astonishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="holiday.c9.p5"><s sid="15" id="holiday.c9.s15">A sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming louder and louder the longer he listened, till at length, in a few moments afterwards, a large hole burst open in the wall of his room, and there stepped into his presence, two magnificent fairies, just arrived from their castle in the air, to pay him a visit.</s> <s sid="16" id="holiday.c9.s16">They had travelled all the way on purpose to have some conversation with Master No-book, and immediately introduced themselves in a very ceremonious manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="holiday.c9.p6"><s sid="17" id="holiday.c9.s17">The fairy Do-nothing was gorgeously dressed with a wreath of flaming gas round her head, a robe of gold tissue, a necklace of rubies, and a bouquet in her hand, of glittering diamonds.</s> <s sid="18" id="holiday.c9.s18">Her cheeks were rouged to the very eyes,--her teeth were set in gold, and her hair was of a most brilliant purple; in short, so fine and fashionable looking a fairy never was seen in a drawing-room before.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="holiday.c9.p7"><s sid="19" id="holiday.c9.s19">The fairy Teach-all, who followed next, was simply dressed in white muslin, with bunches of natural flowers in her light brown hair, and she carried in her hand a few neat small books, which Master No-book looked at with a shudder of aversion.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="holiday.c9.p8"><s sid="20" id="holiday.c9.s20">The two fairies now informed him, that they very often invited large parties of children, to spend some time at their palaces, but as they lived in quite an opposite direction, it was necessary for their young guests to choose which it would be best to visit first; therefore now they had come to inquire of Master No-book, whom he thought it would be most agreeable to accompany on the present occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="holiday.c9.p11"><s sid="31" id="holiday.c9.s31">Nobody need be told which fairy Master No-book preferred; and quite charmed at his own good fortune in receiving so agreeable an invitation, he eagerly gave his hand to the splendid new acquaintance, who promised him so much pleasure and ease, and gladly proceeded, in a carriage lined with velvet, stuffed with downy pillows, and drawn by milk-white swans, to that magnificent residence Castle Needless, which was lighted by a thousand windows during the day, and by a million of lamps every night.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="holiday.c9.p12"><s sid="32" id="holiday.c9.s32">Here Master No-book enjoyed a constant holiday and a constant feast, while a beautiful lady, covered with jewels, was ready to tell him stories from morning till night, and servants waited to pick up his playthings if they fell, or to draw out his purse or his pocket-handkerchief when he wished to use them.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="holiday.c9.p13"><s sid="33" id="holiday.c9.s33">Thus Master No-book lay dozing for hours and days on rich embroidered cushions, never stirring from his place, but admiring the view of trees covered with the richest burned almonds, grottoes of sugar-candy, a jet d'eau of champagne, a wide sea which tasted of sugar instead of salt, and a bright clear pond, filled with gold-fish, that let themselves be caught whenever he pleased.</s> <s sid="34" id="holiday.c9.s34">Nothing could be more complete, and yet, very strange to say, Master No-book did not seem particularly happy!</s> <s sid="35" id="holiday.c9.s35">This appears exceedingly unreasonable, when so much trouble was taken to please him; but the truth is, that every day he became more fretful and peevish.</s> <s sid="36" id="holiday.c9.s36">No sweetmeats were worth the trouble of eating, nothing was pleasant to play at, and in the end he wished it were possible to sleep all day, as well as all night.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="holiday.c9.p14"><s sid="37" id="holiday.c9.s37">Not a hundred miles from the fairy Do-nothing's palace, there lived a most cruel monster called the giant Snap-'em-up, who looked, when he stood up, like the tall steeple of a great church, raising his head so high, that he could peep over the loftiest mountains, and was obliged to climb up a ladder to comb his own hair.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="holiday.c9.p15"><s sid="38" id="holiday.c9.s38">Every morning regularly, this prodigiously great giant walked round the world before breakfast for an appetite, after which, he made tea in a large lake, used the sea as a slop-basin, and boiled his kettle on Mount Vesuvius.</s> <s sid="39" id="holiday.c9.s39">He lived in great style, and his dinners were most magnificent, consisting very often of an elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties, a tiger smothered in onions, stewed lions, and whale soup; but for a side-dish his greatest favourite consisted of little boys, as fat as possible, fried in crumbs of bread, with plenty of pepper and salt.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="holiday.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="holiday.c9.s40">No children were so well fed, or in such good condition for eating, as those in the fairy Do-nothing's garden, who was a very particular friend of the great Snap-'em-up's, and who sometimes laughingly said she would give him a license, and call her own garden his <qs/>"preserve,"<qe/> because she allowed him to help himself, whenever he pleased, to as many of her visitors as he chose, without taking the trouble even to count them, and in return for such extreme civility, the giant very frequently invited her to dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="holiday.c9.p17"><s sid="41" id="holiday.c9.s41">Snap-'em-up's favourite sport was, to see how many brace of little boys he could bag in a morning; so in passing along the streets, he peeped into all the drawing-rooms without having occasion to get upon tiptoe, and picked up every young gentleman who was idly looking out of the windows, and even a few occasionally who were playing truant from school, but busy children seemed always somehow quite out of his reach.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="holiday.c9.p18" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="holiday.c9.s42">One day, when Master No-book felt even more lazy, more idle, and more miserable than ever, he lay beside a perfect mountain of toys and cakes, wondering what to wish for next, and hating the very sight of everything and everybody.</s> <s sid="43" id="holiday.c9.s43">At last he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and disgust, that his jaw very nearly fell out of joint, and then he sighed so deeply, that the giant Snap-'em-up heard the sound as he passed along the road after breakfast, and instantly stepped into the garden, with his glass at his eye, to see what was the matter.</s> <s sid="44" id="holiday.c9.s44">Immediately on observing a large, fat, over-grown boy, as round as a dumpling, lying on a bed of roses, he gave a cry of delight, followed by a gigantic peal of laughter, which was heard three miles off, and picking up Master No-book between his finger and his thumb, with a pinch that very nearly broke his ribs, he carried him rapidly towards his own castle, while the fairy Do-nothing laughingly shook her head as he passed, saying, <qs/>"That little man does me great credit!--he has only been fed for a week, and is as fat already as a prize ox!</s> <s sid="45" id="holiday.c9.s45">What a dainty morsel he will be!</s> <s sid="46" id="holiday.c9.s46">When do you dine to-day, in case I should have time to look in upon you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="holiday.c9.p19"><s sid="47" id="holiday.c9.s47">On reaching home, the giant immediately hung up Master No-book by the hair of his head, on a prodigious hook in the larder, having first taken some large lumps of nasty suet, forcing them down his throat to make him become still fatter, and then stirring the fire, that he might be almost melted with heat, to make his liver grow larger.</s> <s sid="48" id="holiday.c9.s48">On a shelf quite near, Master No-book perceived the dead bodies of six other boys, whom he remembered to have seen fattening in the fairy Do-nothing's garden, while he recollected how some of them had rejoiced at the thoughts of leading a long, useless, idle life, with no one to please but themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="holiday.c9.p20"><s sid="49" id="holiday.c9.s49">The enormous cook now seized hold of Master No-book, brandishing her knife, with an aspect of horrible determination, intending to kill him, while he took the trouble of screaming and kicking in the most desperate manner, when the giant turned gravely round and said, that as pigs were considered a much greater dainty when whipped to death than killed in any other way, he meant to see whether children might not be improved by it also; therefore she might leave that great hog of a boy till he had time to try the experiment, especially as his own appetite would be improved by the exercise.</s> <s sid="50" id="holiday.c9.s50">This was a dreadful prospect for the unhappy prisoner; but meantime it prolonged his life a few hours, as he was immediately hung up again in the larder, and left to himself.</s> <s sid="51" id="holiday.c9.s51">There, in torture of mind and body,--like a fish upon a hook,--the wretched boy began at last to reflect seriously upon his former ways, and to consider what a happy home he might have had, if he could only have been satisfied with business and pleasure succeeding each other, like day and night, while lessons might have come in, as a pleasant sauce to his play-hours, and his play-hours as a sauce to his lessons.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="holiday.c9.p21"><s sid="52" id="holiday.c9.s52">In the midst of many reflections, which were all very sensible, though rather too late.</s> <s sid="53" id="holiday.c9.s53">Master No-book's attention became attracted by the sound of many voices laughing, talking, and singing, which caused him to turn his eyes in a new direction, when, for the first time, he observed that the fairy Teach-all's garden lay upon a beautiful sloping bank not far off.</s> <s sid="54" id="holiday.c9.s54">There a crowd of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked boys, were busily employed, and seemed happier than the day was long; while poor Master No-book watched them during his own miserable hours, envying the enjoyment with which they raked the flower-borders, gathered the fruit, carried baskets of vegetables to the poor, worked with carpenters' tools, drew pictures, shot with bows and arrows, played at cricket, and then sat in the sunny arbours learning their tasks, or talking agreeably together, till at length, a dinner-bell having been rung, the whole party sat merrily down with hearty appetites, and cheerful good-humour, to an entertainment of plain roast meat and pudding, where the fairy Teach-all presided herself, and helped her guests moderately, to as much as was good for each.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="holiday.c9.p22"><s sid="55" id="holiday.c9.s55">Large tears rolled down the cheeks of Master No-book while watching this scene; and remembering that if he had known what was best for him, he might have been as happy as the happiest of these excellent boys, instead of suffering ennui and weariness, as he had done at the fairy Do-nothing's, ending in a miserable death; but his attention was soon after most alarmingly roused by hearing the giant Snap-'em-up again in conversation with his cook, who said, that if he wished for a good large dish of scolloped children at dinner, it would be necessary to catch a few more, as those he had already provided would scarcely be a mouthful.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="holiday.c9.p23"><s sid="56" id="holiday.c9.s56">As the giant kept very fashionable hours, and always waited dinner for himself till nine o'clock, there was still plenty of time; so, with a loud grumble about the trouble, he seized a large basket in his hand, and set off at a rapid pace towards the fairy Teach-all's garden.</s> <s sid="57" id="holiday.c9.s57">It was very seldom that Snap-'em-up ventured to think of foraging in this direction, as he had never once succeeded in carrying off a single captive from the enclosure, it was so well fortified and so bravely defended; but on this occasion, being desperately hungry, he felt as bold as a lion, and walked, with outstretched hands, straight towards the fairy Teach-all's dinner-table, taking such prodigious strides, that he seemed almost as if he would trample on himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="holiday.c9.p24"><s sid="58" id="holiday.c9.s58">A cry of consternation arose the instant this tremendous giant appeared; and as usual on such occasions, when he had made the same attempt before, a dreadful battle took place.</s> <s sid="59" id="holiday.c9.s59">Fifty active little boys bravely flew upon the enemy, armed with their dinner knives, and looked like a nest of hornets, stinging him in every direction, till he roared with pain, and would have run away, but the fairy Teach-all, seeing his intention, rushed forward with the carving knife, and brandishing it high over her head, she most courageously stabbed him to the heart!</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="holiday.c9.p25"><s sid="60" id="holiday.c9.s60">If a great mountain had fallen in the earth, it would have seemed like nothing in comparison of the giant Snap-'em-up, who crushed two or three houses to powder beneath him, and upset several fine monuments that were to have made people remembered for ever; but all this would have seemed scarcely worth mentioning, had it not been for a still greater event which occurred on the occasion, no less than the death of the fairy Do-nothing, who had been indolently looking on at this great battle, without taking the trouble to interfere, or even to care who was victorious, but, being also lazy about running away, when the giant fell, his sword came with so violent a stroke on her head, that she instantly expired.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="holiday.c9.p26"><s sid="61" id="holiday.c9.s61">Thus, luckily for the whole world, the fairy Teach-all got possession of immense property, which she proceeded without delay to make the best use of in her power.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="holiday.c9.p28"><s sid="65" id="holiday.c9.s65">Not long after this, an old uncle, who had formerly been ashamed of Master No-book's indolence and gluttony, became so pleased at the wonderful change, that, on his death, he left him a magnificent estate, desiring that he should take his name; therefore, instead of being any longer one of the No-book family, he is now called Sir Timothy Bluestocking,--a pattern to the whole country round, for the good he does to every one, and especially for his extraordinary activity, appearing as if he could do twenty things at once.</s> <s sid="66" id="holiday.c9.s66">Though generally very good-natured and agreeable, Sir Timothy is occasionally observed in a violent passion, laying about him with his walking-stick in the most terrific manner, and beating little boys within an inch of their lives; but on inquiry, it invariably appears that he has found them out to be lazy, idle, or greedy, for all the industrious boys in the parish are sent to get employment from him, while he assures them that they are far happier breaking stones on the road, than if they were sitting idly in a drawing-room with nothing to do.</s> <s sid="67" id="holiday.c9.s67">Sir Timothy cares very little for poetry in general; but the following are his favourite verses, which he has placed over the chimney-piece at a school that he built for the poor, and every scholar is obliged, the very day he begins his education, to learn them:--</s> </p>
