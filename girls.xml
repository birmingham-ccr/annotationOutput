<p pid="1" id="girls.c0.p1"><s>CHAPTER ONE.</s> <s>"GOOD-BYE" TO THE OLD LIFE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c0.p2"><s>"Me want to see Hetty," said an imperious baby voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c0.p3"><s>"No, no; not this morning, Miss Nan, dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c0.p4"><s>"Me do want to see Hetty," was the quick, impatient reply.</s> <s>And a sturdy indignant little face looked up at Nurse, to watch the effect of the last decisive words.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c0.p5"><s>Finding no affirmative reply on Nurse's placid face, the small lips closed firmly--two dimples came and went on two very round cheeks--the mischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter, and the next moment the little questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door, and was toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hetty's room.</s> <s>The room door was open, so the truant went in.</s> <s>A bed with the bedclothes all tossed about, a half worn-out slipper on the floor, a very untidy dressing-table met her eyes, but no Hetty.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c0.p6"><s>"Me want Hetty, me do," piped the treble voice, and then the little feet commenced a careful and watchful pilgrimage, the lips still firmly shut, the dimples coming and going, and the eyes throwing many upward glances in the direction of Nurse and the nursery.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c0.p7"><s>No pursuit as yet, and great, great hope of finding Hetty somewhere in the down-stair regions.</s> <s>Ah, now, how good! those dangerous stairs had been descended, and the little voice calling in shrill tones for Hetty rang out in the wide hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c0.p8"><s>"Let her come to me," suddenly said an answering voice, and a girl of about twelve, dressed in deep mourning, suddenly opened the door of a small study and clasped the little one in her arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c0.p9"><s>"So you have found me, my precious, my dearest!</s> <s>Brave, plucky little Nan, you have got away from Nurse and found me out!</s> <s>Come into the study, now, darling, and you shall have some breakfast."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c0.p10"><s>"Me want a bicky, Hetty," said the baby voice; the round arms clasped Hester's neck, but the brown eyes were already travelling eagerly over the breakfast table in quest of spoil for those rosy little lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c0.p11"><s>"Here are two biscuits, Nan.</s> <s>Nan, look me in the face--here, sit steady on my knee; you lose me, don't you Nan?"</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c0.p12"><s>"Course me do," said the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c0.p13"><s>"And I'm going away from you, Nan, darling.</s> <s>For months and months I won't see anything of you.</s> <s>My heart will be always with you, and I shall think of you morning, noon, and night.</s> <s>I love no one as I love you, Nan.</s> <s>You will think of me, and love me too; won't you, Nan?"</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c0.p14" type="speech"><s>"Me will," said Nan; <qs/>"me want more bicky, Hetty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c0.p15" type="speech"><s>"Yes, yes," answered Hester; <qs/>"put your arms tight round my neck, and you shall have sugar, too.</s> <s>Tighter than that, Nan, and you shall have two lumps of sugar--oh, yes, you shall--I don't care if it makes you sick-- you shall have just what you want the last moment we are together."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c0.p16"><s>Baby Nan was only too pleased to crumple up a crape frill and to smear a black dress with sticky little fingers for the sake of the sugar which Hetty plied her with.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c0.p17" type="speech"><s>"More, Hetty," she said; <qs/>"me'll skeeze 'oo vedy tight for more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c0.p18"><s>On this scene Nurse unexpectedly entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c0.p19"><s>"Well, I never! and so you found your way all downstairs by yourself, you little toddle.</s> <s>Now, Miss Hetty, I hope you haven't been giving the precious lamb sugar; you know it never does suit the little dear.</s> <s>Oh, fie! baby; and what sticky hands!</s> <s>Miss Hetty, she has crumpled all your crape frills."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c0.p20"><s>"What matter?" said Hester.</s> <s>"I wanted a good hug, and I gave her three or four lumps.</s> <s>Babies won't squeeze you tight for nothing.</s> <s>There, my Nancy, go back to Nurse.</s> <s>Nurse, take her away; I'll break down in a minute if I see her looking at me with that little pout."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c0.p21"><s>Nurse took the child into her arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c0.p22"><s>"Good-bye, Miss Hester, dear.</s> <s>Try to be a good girl at school.</s> <s>Take my word, missy--things won't be as dark as they seem."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c0.p23"><s>"Good-bye, Nurse," said Hester hastily.</s> <s>"Is that you, father? are you calling me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c0.p24" type="speech"><s>She gathered up her muff and gloves, and ran out of the little study where she had been making believe to eat breakfast.</s> <s>A tall, stern-looking man was in the hall, buttoning on an overcoat; a brougham waited at the door.</s> <s>The next moment Hester and her father were bowling away in the direction of the nearest railway station.</s> <s>Nan's little chubby face had faded from view.</s> <s>The old square grey house, sacred to Hester because of Nan, had also disappeared; the avenue even was past, and Hester closed her bright brown eyes.</s> <s>She felt that she was being pushed out into a cold world, and was no longer in the same snug nest with Nan.</s> <s>An intolerable pain was at her heart; she did not glance at her father, who during their entire drive occupied himself over his morning paper.</s> <s>At last they reached the railway station, and just as Sir John Thornton was handing his daughter into a comfortable first-class carriage, marked <qs/>"For Ladies only,"<qe/> and was presenting her with her railway ticket and a copy of the last week's illustrated newspaper, he spoke--</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c0.p25"><s>"The guard will take care of you, Hester.</s> <s>I am giving him full directions, and he will come to you at every station, and bring you tea or any refreshment you may require.</s> <s>This train takes you straight to Sefton, and Mrs Willis will meet you, or send for you there.</s> <s>Good-bye, my love; try to be a good girl, and curb your wild spirits.</s> <s>I hope to see you very much improved when you come home at Midsummer.</s> <s>Good-bye, dear, good-bye.</s> <s>Ah, you want to kiss me--well, just one kiss.</s> <s>There-- oh, my dear! you know I have a great dislike to emotion in public."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c0.p26"><s>Sir John Thornton said this because a pair of arms had been flung suddenly round his neck, and two kisses imprinted passionately on his sallow cheek.</s> <s>A tear also rested on his cheek, but that he wiped away.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="girls.c0.p27"><s>CHAPTER TWO.</s> <s>TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c0.p28"><s>The train moved rapidly on its way, and the girl in one corner of the railway carriage cried silently behind her crape veil.</s> <s>Her tears were very subdued, but her heart felt sore, bruised, indignant; she hated the idea of school-life before her, she hated the expected restraints and the probable punishments; she fancied herself going from a free life into a prison, and detested it accordingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="girls.c0.p29"><s>Three months before, Hester Thornton had been one of the happiest, brightest, and merriest of little girls in ---shire; but the mother who was her guardian angel, who had kept the frank and spirited child in check without appearing to do so, who had guided her by the magical power of love and not in the least by that of fear, had met her death suddenly by means of a carriage accident, and Hester and baby Nan were left motherless.</s> <s>Several little brothers and sisters had come between Hester and Nan, but from various causes they had all died in their infancy, and only the eldest and youngest of Sir John Thornton's family remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="girls.c0.p30"><s>Hester's father was stern, uncompromising.</s> <s>He was a very just and upright man, but he knew nothing of the ways of children, and when Hester in her usual tom-boyish fashion climbed trees and tore her dresses, and rode bare-backed on one or two of his most dangerous horses, he not only tried a little sharp, and therefore useless, correction, but determined to take immediate steps to have his wild and rather unmanageable little daughter sent to a first-class school.</s> <s>Hester was on her way there now, and very sore was her heart, and indignant her impulses.</s> <s>Father's "good-bye" seemed to her to be the crowning touch to her unhappiness, and she made up her mind not to be good, not to learn her lessons, not to come home at Midsummer crowned with honours and reduced to an every-day and pattern little girl.</s> <s>No, she would be the same wild Hetty as of yore: and when father saw that school could do nothing for her, that it could never make her into a good and ordinary little girl, he would allow her to remain at home.</s> <s>At home there was, at least, Nan to love, and there was mother to remember.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="girls.c0.p31"><s>Hetty was a child of the strongest feelings.</s> <s>Since her mother's death she had scarcely mentioned her name.</s> <s>When her father alluded to his wife, Hester ran out of the room: when the servants spoke of their late mistress, Hester turned pale, stamped her feet, and told them to be quiet.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="girls.c0.p32"><s>"You are not worthy to speak of my mother," she electrified them all one day by exclaiming.</s> <s>"My mother is an angel now, and you--oh, you are not fit to breathe her name!"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="girls.c0.p33" type="speech"><s>Only to one person would Hetty ever voluntarily say a word about the beloved dead mother, and that was to little Nan.</s> <s>Nan said her prayers, as she expressed it, to Hetty now; and Hetty taught her a little phrase to use instead of the familiar <qs/>"God bless mother."<qe/></s> <s>She taught the child to say, <qs/>"Thank God for making mother into a beautiful angel;"<qe/> and when Nan asked what an angel was, and how the cosy mother she remembered could be turned into one, Hester was beguiled into a soft and tearful talk, and she drew several lovely pictures of white-robed angels, until the little child was satisfied and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="girls.c0.p34"><s>"Me like that, Hetty--me'll be angel too, Hetty, same as mamma."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="girls.c0.p35"><s>These talks with Nan, however, did not come very often, and of late they had almost ceased, for Nan was only two and a half, and the strange sad fact remained that in three months she had almost forgotten her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="girls.c0.p36"><s>Hester on her way to school this morning cried for some time, then she sat silent, her crape veil still down, and her eyes watching furtively her fellow-passengers.</s> <s>They consisted of two rather fidgety old ladies, who wrapped themselves in rugs, were very particular on the question of hot bottles, and watched Hester in their turn with considerable curiosity and interest.</s> <s>Presently one of them offered the little girl a sandwich, which she was too proud or too shy to accept, although by this time she was feeling extremely hungry.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="girls.c0.p37"><s>"You will, perhaps, prefer a cake, my dear?" said the good-natured little old lady.</s> <s>"My sister Agnes has got some delicious queen-cakes in her basket--will you eat one?"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="girls.c0.p38"><s>Hester murmured a feeble assent, and the queen-cake did her so much good that she ventured to raise her crape veil and to look around her.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="girls.c0.p39"><s>"Ah, that is much better," said the first little old lady.</s> <s>"Come to this side of the carriage, my love; we are just going to pass through a lovely bit of country, and you will like to watch the view.</s> <s>See; if you place yourself here, my sister Agnes's basket will be just at your feet, and you can help yourself to a queen-cake whenever you are so disposed."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="girls.c0.p40" type="speech"><s>"Thank you," responded Hester, in a much more cheerful tone, for it was really quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a bright-looking little old lady; <qs/>"your queen-cakes are very nice, and I liked that one, but one is quite enough, thank you.</s> <s>It is Nan who is so particularly fond of queen-cakes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="girls.c0.p41"><s>"And who is Nan, my dear?" asked the sister to whom the queen-cakes specially belonged.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="girls.c0.p42"><s>"She is my dear little baby sister," said Hester in a sorrowful tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="girls.c0.p43"><s>"Ah, and it was about her you were crying just now," said the first lady, laying her hand on Hester's arm.</s> <s>"Never mind us, dear, we have seen a great many tears--a great many.</s> <s>They are the way of the world.</s> <s>Women are born to them.</s> <s>As Kingsley says--`women must weep.'</s> <s>It was quite natural that you should cry about your sweet little Nan, and I wish we could send her some of these queen-cakes that you say she is so fond of.</s> <s>Are you going to be long away from her, love?"</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="girls.c0.p44" type="speech"><s>"Oh, yes, for months and months," said Hester.</s> <s>"I did not know," she added, <qs/>"that it was such a common thing to cry.</s> <s>I never used to."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="girls.c0.p45"><s>"Ah, you have had other trouble, poor child," glancing at her deep mourning frock.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="girls.c0.p46"><s>"Yes, it is since then I have cried so often.</s> <s>Please, I would rather not speak about it."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="girls.c0.p47"><s>"Quite right, my love, quite right," said Miss Agnes in a much brisker tone than her sister.</s> <s>"We will turn the conversation now to something inspiriting.</s> <s>Jane is quite right, there are plenty of tears in the world; but there is also a great deal of sunshine and heaps of laughter, merry laughter--the laughter of youth, my child.</s> <s>Now, I dare say, though you have begun your journey so sadly, that you are really bound on quite a pleasant little expedition.</s> <s>For instance, you are going to visit a kind aunt, or some one else who will give you a delightful welcome."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="girls.c0.p48" type="speech"><s>"No," said Hester, <qs/>"I am not.</s> <s>I am going to a dreadful place, and the thought of that, and parting from little Nan, are the reasons why I cried.</s> <s>I am going to prison--I am, indeed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="girls.c0.p49"><s>"Oh, my dear love!" exclaimed both the little old ladies in a breath.</s> <s>Then Miss Agnes continued:</s> <s>"You have really taken Jane's breath away-- quite.</s> <s>Yes, Jane, I see that you are in for an attack of palpitation.</s> <s>Never mind her, dear, she palpitates very easily; but I think you must be mistaken, my love, in mentioning such an appalling word as `prison.'</s> <s>Yes, now I come to think of it, it is absolutely certain that you must be mistaken; for if you were going to such a terrible place of punishment you would be under the charge of a policeman.</s> <s>You are given to strong language, dear, like other young folk."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="girls.c0.p50" type="speech"><s>"Well, I call it prison," continued Hester, who was rather flattered by all this bustle and Miss Jane's agitation; <qs/>"it has a dreadful sound, hasn't it?</s> <s>I call it prison, but father says I am going to school--you can't wonder that I am crying, can you?</s> <s>Oh! what is the matter?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="girls.c0.p51"><s>For the two little old ladies jumped up at this juncture, and gave Hetty a kiss apiece on her soft young lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="girls.c0.p52"><s>"My darling," they both exclaimed.</s> <s>"We are so relieved and delighted! your strong language startled us, and school is anything but what you imagine, dear.</s> <s>Ah, Jane! can you ever forget our happy days at school?"</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="girls.c0.p53"><s>Miss Jane sighed and rolled up her eyes, and then the two commenced a vigorous catechising of the little girl.</s> <s>Really, Hester could not help feeling almost sunshiny before that long journey came to an end, for she and the Misses Bruce made some delightful discoveries.</s> <s>The little old ladies very quickly found out that they lived close to the school where Hetty was to spend the next few months.</s> <s>They knew Mrs Willis well-- they knew the delightful rambling, old-fashioned house where Hester was to live--they even knew two or three of the scholars: and they said so often to the little girl that she was going into a life of clover-- positive clover--that she began to smile, and even partly to believe them.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="girls.c0.p54"><s>"I am glad I shall be near you, at least," she said at last, with a frank sweet smile, for she had greatly taken to her kind fellow-travellers.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="girls.c0.p55" type="speech"><s>"Yes, my dear," exclaimed Miss Jane.</s> <s>"We attend the same church, and I shall look out for you on Sunday, and," she continued, glancing first at her sister and then addressing Hester, <qs/>"perhaps Mrs Willis will allow you to visit us occasionally."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="girls.c0.p56"><s>"I'll come to-morrow, if you like," said Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="girls.c0.p57"><s>"Well, dear, well--that must be as Mrs Willis thinks best.</s> <s>Ah, here we are at Sefton at last.</s> <s>We shall look out for you in church on Sunday, my love."</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="girls.c0.p58"><s>CHAPTER THREE.</s> <s>AT LAVENDER HOUSE.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="girls.c0.p59"><s>Hester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable.</s> <s>She had taken a great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made themselves pleasant in her behalf.</s> <s>She felt herself something like a heroine as she poured out a little, just a little, of her troubles into their sympathising ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to school and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be another and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to her future.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="girls.c0.p60"><s>But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender House, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled.</s> <s>The Misses Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to their small villa in the town, but Lavender House was some distance off, and the little omnibus never went so far.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="girls.c0.p61"><s>An old-fashioned carriage, which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs Willis, had been sent to meet her, and a man whom the Misses Bruce addressed as "Thomas" helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau on the roof of the vehicle.</s> <s>The little girl had to take her drive alone, and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed up and down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion.</s> <s>It was a cold winter's day, and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in Sefton, and had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender House, it was very nearly dark.</s> <s>Hester trembled at the darkness, and when the gates were shut behind them by a rosy-faced urchin of ten, she once more began to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going to prison.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="girls.c0.p62"><s>They drove slowly down a long and winding avenue, and, although Hester could not see, she knew they must be passing under trees, for several times their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage.</s> <s>At last they came to a standstill.</s> <s>The old servant scrambled slowly down from his seat on the box, and, opening the carriage-door, held out his hand to help the little stranger to alight.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="girls.c0.p63" type="speech"><s>"Come now, missy," he said in cheering tones, <qs/>"come out, and you'll be warm and snug in a minute.</s> <s>Dear, dear!</s> <s>I expect you're nearly froze up, poor little miss, and it _is_ a most bitter cold night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="girls.c0.p64"><s>He rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch, and the next moment the wide hall door was flung open by a neat maid-servant, and Hester stepped within.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="girls.c0.p65"><s>"She's come," exclaimed several voices in different keys, and proceeding apparently from different quarters.</s> <s>Hester looked around her in a half-startled way, but she could see no one, except the maid, who smiled at her and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="girls.c0.p66"><s>"Welcome to Lavender House, miss.</s> <s>If you'll step into the porter's room for one moment, there is a good fire there, and I'll acquaint Miss Danesbury that you have arrived."</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="girls.c0.p67"><s>The little room in question was at the right-hand side of a very wide and cheerful hall, which was decorated in pale tints of green, and had a handsome encaustic-tiled floor.</s> <s>A blazing fire and two lamps made the hall look cheerful, but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the unknown voices in the porter's small room.</s> <s>She found herself quite trembling with shyness, and cold, and an indescribable longing to get back to Nan; and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully who or what Miss Danesbury was, she scarcely derived any comfort from the blazing fire near which she stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="girls.c0.p68"><s>"Rather tall for her age, but I fear, I greatly fear, a little sulky," said a voice behind her; and when she turned round in an agony of trepidation and terror, she suddenly found herself face to face with a tall, kind-looking, middle-aged lad and also with a bright gipsy-looking girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="girls.c0.p69"><s>"Annie Forest, how very naughty of you to hide behind the door!</s> <s>You are guilty of disobedience in coming into the room without leave.</s> <s>I must report you, my dear; yes, I really must.</s> <s>You lose two good conduct marks for this, and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your usual quantity of French poetry."</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="girls.c0.p70" type="speech"><s>"But she won't tell on me, she won't, dear old Danesbury," said the girl; <qs/>"she couldn't be so hard-hearted, the precious love, particularly as curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues!</s> <s>Take a kiss, Danesbury, and now, a you love me you'll be merciful!"<qe/></s> <s>The girl flitted away, and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester, whose face had changed from red to pale during this little scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="girls.c0.p71"><s>"What a horrid, vulgar, low-bred girl!" she exclaimed with passion, for in all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined that personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence.</s> <s>"I hope she'll get a lot of punishment--I hope you are not going to forgive her," she continued, for her anger had for the time quite overcome her shyness.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="girls.c0.p72"><s>"Oh, my dear, my dear! we should all be forgiving," exclaimed Miss Danesbury in her gentle voice.</s> <s>"Welcome to Lavender House, love; I am sorry I was not in the hall to receive you.</s> <s>Had I been, this little _rencontre_ would not have occurred.</s> <s>Annie Forest meant no harm, however--she's a wild little sprite, but affectionate.</s> <s>You and she will be the best friends possible by-and-by.</s> <s>Now, let me take you to your room; the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes, and I am sure you will be glad of something to eat."</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="girls.c0.p73"><s>Miss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad, low, thickly-carpeted stairs.</s> <s>When they had ascended two flights, and were standing on a handsome landing, she paused.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="girls.c0.p74"><s>"Do you see this baize door, dear?" she said.</s> <s>"This is the entrance to the school part of the house.</s> <s>This part that we are now in belongs exclusively to Mrs Willis, and the girls are never allowed to come here without leave.</s> <s>All the school-life is lived at the other side of this baize door, and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little girls who make up their minds to be brave and good.</s> <s>Now kiss me, my dear, and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House."</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="girls.c0.p75"><s>"Are you our principal teacher, then?" asked Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="girls.c0.p76"><s>"I? oh dear, no, my love.</s> <s>I teach the younger children English, and I look after the interests and comforts of all.</s> <s>I am a very useful sort of person, I believe, and I have a motherly heart, dear, and it is a way with little girls to come to me when they are in trouble.</s> <s>Now, my love, we must not chatter any longer.</s> <s>Take my hand, and let us get to your room as fast as possible."</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="girls.c0.p77" type="speech"><s>Miss Danesbury pushed open the baize door, and instantly Hester found herself in a different region.</s> <s>Mrs Willis's part of the house gave the impression of warmth, luxuriance, and even elegance of arrangement.</s> <s>At the other side of the door were long, narrow corridors, with snow-white, but carpetless floors, and rather cold, distempered walls.</s> <s>Miss Danesbury, holding the new pupil's hand, led her down two corridors, and past a great number of shut doors, behind which Hester could near suppressed laughter and eager, chattering voices.</s> <s>At last, however, they stopped at a door which had the number <qs/>"32"<qe/> written over it.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="girls.c0.p78" type="speech"><s>"This is your bedroom, dear," said the English teacher, <qs/>"and to-night you will not be sorry to have it alone.</s> <s>Mrs Willis received a telegram from Susan Drummond, your room-mate, this afternoon, and she will not arrive until to-morrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="girls.c0.p79"><s>However bare and even cold the corridors looked, the bedroom into which Hester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance.</s> <s>It was a small, but daintily-furnished little room.</s> <s>The floor was carpeted with green felt, the one window was hung with pretty draperies, and two little, narrow, white beds were arranged gracefully with French canopies.</s> <s>All the furniture in the room was of a minute description, but good of its kind.</s> <s>Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of drawers.</s> <s>At two corresponding corners were marble washhand-stands, and even two pretty, toilet tables stood side by side in the recess of the window.</s> <s>But the sight that perhaps pleased Hester most was a small bright fire which burnt in the grate.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="girls.c0.p80"><s>"Now, dear, this is your room.</s> <s>As you have arrived first you can choose your own bed and your own chest of drawers.</s> <s>Ah, that is right, Ellen has unfastened your portmanteau; she will unpack your trunk to-night, and take it to the box-room.</s> <s>Now, dear, smooth your hair and wash your hands.</s> <s>The gong will sound instantly.</s> <s>I will come for you when it does."</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="girls.c0.p81"><s>CHAPTER FOUR.</s> <s>LITTLE DRAWING-ROOMS AND LITTLE TIFFS.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="girls.c0.p82"><s>Miss Danesbury, true to her word, came to fetch Hester down to tea.</s> <s>They went down some broad carpetless stairs, along a wide stone hall, and then paused for an instant at a half-open door from which a stream of eager voices issued.</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="girls.c0.p83"><s>"I will introduce you to your school-fellows, and I hope your future friends," said Miss Danesbury.</s> <s>"After tea you will come with me to see Mrs Willis--she is never in the school-room at tea-time.</s> <s>Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier or Miss Good usually superintends.</s> <s>Now, my dear, come along-- why, surely you are not frightened?"</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="girls.c0.p84"><s>"Oh, please, may I sit near you?" asked Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="girls.c0.p85"><s>"No, my love; I take care of the little ones, and they are at a table by themselves.</s> <s>Now, come in at once--the moment you dread will soon be over, and it is nothing, my love--really nothing."</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="girls.c0.p86"><s>Nothing! never, as long as Hester lived, did she forget the supreme agony of terror and shyness which came over her as she entered that long, low, brightly-lighted room.</s> <s>The forty pairs of curious eyes which were raised inquisitively to her face became as torturing as forty burning suns.</s> <s>She felt an almost uncontrollable desire to run away and hide--she wondered if she could possibly keep from screaming aloud.</s> <s>In the end she found herself, she scarcely knew how, seated beside a gentle, sweet-mannered girl, and munching bread and butter which tasted drier than sawdust, and occasionally trying to sip something very hot and scalding which she vaguely understood went by the name of tea.</s> <s>The buzzing voices all chattering eagerly in French, and the occasional sharp, high-pitched reprimands coming in peremptory tones from the thin lips of Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier, sounded far off and distant--her head was dizzy, her eyes swam--the tired and shy child endured tortures.</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="girls.c0.p87"><s>In after-days, in long after-years when the memory of Lavender House was to come back to Hetty Thornton as one of the sweetest, brightest episodes in her existence--in the days when she was to know almost every blade of grass in the gardens, and to be familiar with each corner of the old house, with each face which now appeared so strange, she might wonder at her feelings to-night, but never even then could she forget them.</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="girls.c0.p88"><s>She sat at the table in a dream, trying to eat the tasteless bread and butter.</s> <s>Suddenly and swiftly the thick and somewhat stale piece of bread on her plate was exchanged for a thin, fresh, and delicately-cut slice.</s> </p>

<p pid="89" id="girls.c0.p89" type="speech"><s>"Eat that,<qs/>" whispered a voice--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>I know the other is horrid.</s> <s>It's a shame of Perier to give such stuff to a stranger."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="girls.c0.p90"><s>"Mdlle.</s> <s>Cecile, you are transgressing: you are talking English," came in a torrent of rapid French from the head of the table.</s> <s>"You lose a conduct mark, ma'amselle."</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="girls.c0.p91"><s>The young girl who sat next Hester inclined her head gently and submissively, and Hester, venturing to glance at her, saw that a delicate pink had spread itself over her pale face.</s> <s>She was a plain girl; but even Hester, in this first moment of terror, could scarcely have been afraid of her, so benign was her expression, so sweet the glance from her soft, full brown eyes.</s> <s>Hester now further observed that the thin bread and butter had been removed from Cecil's own plate.</s> <s>She began to wonder why this girl was indulged with better food than the rest of her comrades.</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="girls.c0.p92"><s>Hester was beginning to feel a little less shy, and was taking one or two furtive glances at her companions, when she suddenly felt herself turning crimson, and all her agony of shyness and dislike to her school-life returning.</s> <s>She encountered the full, bright, quizzical gaze of the girl who had made personal remarks about her in the porter's room.</s> <s>The merry black eyes of this gipsy maiden fairly twinkled with suppressed fun when they met hers, and the bright head even nodded audaciously across the table to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="girls.c0.p94"><s>At this moment grace was repeated in sonorous tones by a stern-looking person who sat at the foot of the long table, and whom Hester had not before noticed.</s> <s>Instantly the girls rose from their seats, and began to file in orderly procession out of the tea-room.</s> <s>Hester looked round in terror for the friendly Miss Danesbury, but she could not catch sight of her anywhere.</s> <s>At this moment, however, her companion of the tea-table touched her arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="girls.c0.p97"><s>"Come then," said Cecil Temple, and she pulled Hester's hand within her arm, and walked with her across the wide stone hall, and into the largest room Hester had ever seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="girls.c0.p98"><s>Never, anywhere, could there have been a more delightful play-room than this.</s> <s>It was so large that two great fires which burned at either end were not at all too much to emit even tolerable warmth.</s> <s>The room was bright with three or four lamps which were suspended from the ceiling, the floor was covered with matting, and the walls were divided into curious partitions, which gave the room a peculiar but very cosy effect.</s> <s>These partitions consisted of large panels, and were divided by slender rails the one from the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="girls.c0.p108"><s>As Cecil finished her rather eager defence of her friend, and prevented the indignant words which were bubbling to Hester's lips, a gay voice was heard singing a comic song in the passage--the play-room door was flung open with a bang, and Miss Forest entered the room with a small girl seated on each of her shoulders.</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="girls.c0.p109"><s>"Hold on, Janny love; keep your arms well round me, Mabel.</s> <s>Now then, here we go--twice up the room and down again.</s> <s>No more, as I'm alive.</s> <s>I've got to attend to other matters than you."</s> </p>

<p pid="116" id="girls.c0.p116" type="speech"><s>"You dear stranger!" she exclaimed, turning round and gazing full into Hester's shy face, <qs/>"I do declare I have been punished for the intense ardour with which I longed to embrace you.</s> <s>Has she told you, Cecil darling, what I did in her behalf?</s> <s>How I ventured beyond the sacred precincts of the baize door and hid inside the porter's room?</s> <s>Poor dear, she jumped when she heard my friendly voice, and as I spoke Miss Danesbury caught me in the very act.</s> <s>Poor old dear, she cried when she complained of me, but duty is Danesbury's motto; she would go to the stake for it, and I respect her immensely.</s> <s>I have got my twenty lines of that horrible French poetry, to learn--the very thought almost strangles me, and I foresee plainly that I shall do something terribly naughty within the next few hours; I must, my love--I really must.</s> <s>I have just come here to shake hands with Miss Thornton, and then I must away to my penance.</s> <s>Ah, how little I shall learn, and how hard I shall think!</s> <s>Welcome to Lavender House, Miss Thornton; look upon me as your devoted ally, and if you have a spark of pity in your breast, feel for the girl whom you got into a scrape the very moment you entered these sacred walls."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="girls.c0.p117"><s>"I don't understand you," said Hester, who would not hold out her hand, and who was standing up in a very stiff, shy, and angular position.</s> <s>"I think you were very rude to startle me, and make personal remarks the very moment I came into the house."</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="girls.c0.p121"><s>But Hester felt either too shy or too miserable to yield to this request--she half turned her back, and leaned against Miss Temple's panel.</s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="girls.c0.p125"><s>Annie Forest had scarcely left the room before Miss Danesbury appeared with a message for Hester, who was to come with her directly to see Mrs Willis.</s> <s>The poor shy girl felt only too glad to leave behind her the cruel, staring, and now by no means approving eyes of her school-mates.</s> <s>She had overheard several of their whispers, and felt rather alarmed at her own act.</s> <s>But Hester, shy as she was, could be very tenacious of an idea.</s> <s>She had taken a dislike to Annie Forest, and she was quite determined to be true to what she considered her convictions--namely, that Annie was underbred and common, and not at all the kind of girl whom her mother would have cared for her to know.</s> <s>The little girl followed Miss Danesbury in silence.</s> <s>They crossed the stone hall together, and now passing through another baize door, found themselves once more in the handsome entrance-hall.</s> <s>They walked across this hall to a door carefully protected from all draughts by rich plush curtains, and Miss Danesbury, turning the handle, and going a step or two into the room, said in her gentle voice--</s> </p>

<p pid="126" id="girls.c0.p126"><s>"I have brought Hester Thornton to see you, Mrs Willis, according to your wish."</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="girls.c0.p127"><s>Miss Danesbury then withdrew, and Hester ventured to raise her eyes and to look timidly at the head-mistress.</s> </p>

<p pid="128" id="girls.c0.p128"><s>A tall woman, with a beautiful face and silvery white hair, came instantly to meet her, laid her two hands on the girl's shoulders, and then, raising her shy little face, imprinted a kiss on her forehead.</s> </p>

<p pid="129" id="girls.c0.p129" type="speech"><s>"Your mother was one of my earliest pupils, Hester," she said, <qs/>"and you are--no--"<qe/><sss/> after a pause, <sse/><qs/>"you are not very like her.</s> <s>You are her child, however, my dear, and as such you have a warm welcome from me.</s> <s>Now, come and sit by the fire, and let us talk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="girls.c0.p130"><s>Hester did not feel nearly so constrained with this graceful and gracious lady as she had done with her school-mates.</s> <s>The atmosphere of the room recalled her beloved mother's boudoir at home.</s> <s>The rich, dove-coloured satin dress, the cap made of Mechlin lace which softened and shaded Mrs Willis's silvery hair, appeared homelike to the little girl, who had grown up accustomed to all the luxuries of wealth.</s> <s>Above all, the head-mistress's mention of her mother drew her heart toward the beautiful face, and attracted her toward the rich, full tones of a voice which could be powerful and commanding at will.</s> <s>Mrs Willis, notwithstanding her white hair, had a youthful face, and Hester made the comment which came first to her lips--</s> </p>

<p pid="131" id="girls.c0.p131"><s>"I did not think you were old enough to have taught my mother."</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="girls.c0.p132"><s>"I am sixty, dear, and I have kept this school for thirty years.</s> <s>Your mother was not the only pupil who sent her children to be taught by me when the time came.</s> <s>Now, you can sit on this stool by the fire and tell me about your home.</s> <s>Your mother--ah, poor child, you would rather not talk about her just yet.</s> <s>Helen's daughter must have strong feelings-- ah, yes; I see, I see.</s> <s>Another time, darling, when you know me better.</s> <s>Now tell me about your little sister, and your father.</s> <s>You do not know, perhaps, that I am Nan's godmother?"</s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="girls.c0.p133"><s>After this the head-mistress and the new pupil had a long conversation.</s> <s>Hester forgot her shyness; her whole heart had gone out instantly to this beautiful woman who had known, and loved, and taught her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="girls.c0.p134" type="speech"><s>"I will try to be good at school," she said at last; <qs/>"but, oh, please, Mrs Willis, it does not seem to me to-night as if school-life could be happy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="135" id="girls.c0.p135"><s>"It has its trials, Hester; but the brave and the noble girls often find this time of discipline one of the best in their lives--good at the time, very good to look back on by-and-by.</s> <s>You will find a miniature world around you; you will be surrounded by temptations; and you will have rare chances of proving whether your character can be strong and great and true.</s> <s>I think, as a rule, my girls are happy, and as a rule they turn out well.</s> <s>The great motto of life here, Hester, is earnestness.</s> <s>We are earnest in our work, we are earnest in our play.</s> <s>A half-hearted girl has no chance at Lavender House.</s> <s>In play-time, laugh with the merriest, my child: in school-hours, study with the most studious.</s> <s>Do you understand me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="girls.c0.p136" type="speech"><s>"I try to, a little," said Hester, <qs/>"but it seems all very strange just now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="girls.c0.p138"><s>"Yes--Cecil Temple has been kind to me."</s> </p>

<p pid="139" id="girls.c0.p139"><s>"Cecil is one of my dearest pupils; cultivate her friendship, Hester-- she is honourable, she is sympathising.</s> <s>I am not afraid to say that Cecil has a great heart."</s> </p>

<p pid="144" id="girls.c0.p144"><s>CHAPTER SIX.</s> <s>"I AM UNHAPPY."</s> </p>

<p pid="145" id="girls.c0.p145"><s>Between forty and fifty young girls assembled night and morning for prayers in the pretty chapel which adjoined Lavender House.</s> <s>This chapel had been reconstructed from the ruins of an ancient priory, on the site of which the house was built.</s> <s>The walls, and even the beautiful eastern window, belonged to a far-off date.</s> <s>The roof had been carefully reared in accordance with the style of the east window, and the whole effect was beautiful and impressive.</s> <s>Mrs Willis was particularly fond of her own chapel.</s> <s>Here she hoped the girls' best lessons might be learned, and here she had even once or twice brought a refractory pupil, and tried what a gentle word or two spoken in these old and sacred walls might effect.</s> <s>Here, on wet Sundays the girls assembled for service; and here, every evening at nine o'clock, came the vicar of the large parish to which Lavender House belonged, to conduct evening prayers.</s> <s>He was an old man, and a great friend of Mrs Willis's, and he often told her that he considered these young girls some of the most important members of his flock.</s> </p>

<p pid="146" id="girls.c0.p146"><s>Here Hester knelt to-night.</s> <s>It is to be doubted whether in her confusion, and in the strange loneliness which even Mrs Willis had scarcely removed, she prayed much.</s> <s>It is certain she did not join in the evening hymn, which, with the aid of an organ and some sweet girl-voices, was beautifully and almost pathetically rendered.</s> <s>After evening prayers had come to an end, Mrs Willis took Hester's hand and led her up to the old, white-headed vicar.</s> </p>

<p pid="147" id="girls.c0.p147"><s>"This is my new pupil, Mr Everard, or rather I should say, our new pupil.</s> <s>Her education depends as much on you as on me."</s> </p>

<p pid="148" id="girls.c0.p148"><s>The vicar held out his hands, and took Hester's within them, and then drew her forward to the light.</s> </p>

<p pid="149" id="girls.c0.p149"><s>"This little face does not seem quite strange to me," he said.</s> <s>"Have I ever seen you before, my dear?"</s> </p>

<p pid="150" id="girls.c0.p150"><s>"No, sir," replied Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="151" id="girls.c0.p151" type="speech"><s>"You have seen her mother,<qs/>" said Mrs Willis--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>Do you remember your favourite pupil, Helen Anstey, of long ago?"<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="153" id="girls.c0.p153"><s>But Hester's face had grown white.</s> <s>The solemn service in the chapel, joined to all the excitement and anxieties of the day, had strung up her sensitive nerves to a pitch higher than she could endure.</s> <s>Suddenly, as the vicar spoke to her, and Mrs Willis looked kindly down at her new pupil, the chapel seemed to reel round, the pupils one by one disappeared, and the tired girl only saved herself from fainting by a sudden burst of tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="154" id="girls.c0.p154" type="speech"><s>"Oh, I am unhappy," she sobbed, <qs/>"without my mother!</s> <s>Please, please, don't talk to me about my mother."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="155" id="girls.c0.p155"><s>She could scarcely take in the gentle words which her two friends said to her, and she hardly noticed when Mrs Willis did such a wonderful thing as to stoop down and kiss a second time the lips of a new pupil.</s> </p>

<p pid="156" id="girls.c0.p156"><s>Finally she found herself consigned to Miss Danesbury's care, who hurried her off to her room, and helped her to undress and tucked her into her little bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="157" id="girls.c0.p157"><s>"Now, love, you shall have some hot gruel.</s> <s>No, not a word.</s> <s>You ate little or no tea, to-night--I watched you from my distant table.</s> <s>Half your loneliness is caused by want of food--I know it, my love; I am a very practical person.</s> <s>Now, eat your gruel, and then shut your eyes and go to sleep."</s> </p>

<p pid="158" id="girls.c0.p158" type="speech"><s>"You are very kind to me," said Hester, <qs/>"and so is Mrs Willis, and so is Mr Everard, and I like Cecil Temple--but, oh.</s> <s>I wish Annie Forest was not in the school!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="162" id="girls.c0.p162"><s>If Hester Thornton went to sleep that night under a sort of dreamy, hazy impression that school was a place without a great deal of order, with many kind and sympathising faces, and with some not so agreeable; if she went to sleep under the impression that she had dropped into a sort of medley, that she had found herself in a vast new world where certain personages exercised undoubtedly a strong moral influence, but where on the whole a number of other people did pretty much what they pleased-- she awoke in the morning to find her preconceived ideas scattered to the four winds.</s> </p>

<p pid="163" id="girls.c0.p163"><s>There was nothing of apparent liberty about the Lavender House arrangements in the early morning hours.</s> <s>In the first, place, it seemed quite the middle of the night when Hester was awakened by a loud gong, which clanged through the house and caused her to sit up in bed in a considerable state of fright and perplexity.</s> <s>A moment or two later a neatly-dressed maid-servant came into the room with a can of hot water; she lit a pair of candles on the mantelpiece, and, with the remark that the second gong would sound in half an hour, and that all the young ladies would be expected to assemble in the chapel at seven o'clock precisely, she left the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="164" id="girls.c0.p164"><s>Hester pulled her pretty little gold watch from under her pillow, and saw with a sigh that it was now half-past six.</s> </p>

<p pid="165" id="girls.c0.p165"><s>"What odious hours they keep in this horrid place!" she said to herself.</s> <s>"Well, well, I always did know that school would be unendurable."</s> </p>

<p pid="166" id="girls.c0.p166"><s>She waited for five minutes before she got up, and then she dressed herself languidly, and, if the truth must be told, in a very untidy fashion.</s> <s>She managed to be dressed by the time the second gong sounded, but she had only one moment to give to her private prayers.</s> <s>She reflected, however, that this did not greatly matter as she was going down to prayers immediately in the chapel.</s> </p>

<p pid="167" id="girls.c0.p167"><s>The service in the chapel the night before had impressed her more deeply than she cared to own, and she followed her companions downstairs with a certain feeling of pleasure at the thought of again seeing Mr Everard and Mrs Willis.</s> <s>She wondered if they would take much notice of her this morning, and she thought it just possible that Mr Everard, who had looked at her so compassionately the night before, might be induced, for the sake of his old friendship with her mother, to take her home with him to spend the day.</s> <s>She thought she would rather like to spend a day with Mr Everard, and she fancied he was the sort of person who would influence her and help her to be good.</s> <s>Hester fancied that if some very interesting and quite out of the common person took her in hand, she might be formed into something extremely noble--noble enough even to forgive Annie Forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="168" id="girls.c0.p168"><s>The girls all filed into the chapel, which was lighted as brightly and cheerily as the night before; but Hester found herself placed on a bench far down in the building.</s> <s>She was no longer in the place of honour by Mrs Willis's side.</s> <s>She was one of a number, and no one looked particularly at her or noticed her in any way.</s> <s>A shy young curate read the morning prayers; Mr Everard was not present, and Mrs Willis, who was, walked out of the chapel when prayers were over without even glancing in Hester's direction.</s> <s>This was bad enough for the poor little dreamer of dreams, but worse was to follow.</s> </p>

<p pid="169" id="girls.c0.p169"><s>Mrs Willis did not speak to Hester, but she did stop for an instant beside Annie Forest.</s> <s>Hester saw her lay her white hand on the young girl's shoulder and whisper for an instant in her ear.</s> <s>Annie's lovely gipsy face flushed a vivid crimson.</s> </p>

<p pid="170" id="girls.c0.p170"><s>"For your sake, darling," she whispered back; but Hester caught the words, and was consumed by a fierce jealousy.</s> </p>

<p pid="171" id="girls.c0.p171"><s>The girls went into the school-room, where Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier gave a French lesson to the upper class.</s> <s>Hester belonged to no class at present, and could look around her, and have plenty of time to reflect on her own miseries, and particularly on what she now considered the favouritism shown by Mrs Willis.</s> </p>

<p pid="172" id="girls.c0.p172" type="speech"><s>"Mr Everard at least will read through that girl," she said to herself; <qs/>"he could not possibly endure any one so loud.</s> <s>Yes, I am sure that my only friend at home, Cecilia Day, would call Annie very loud.</s> <s>I wonder Mrs Willis can endure her.</s> <s>Mrs Willis seems so ladylike herself, but--Oh, I beg your pardon, what's the matter?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="173" id="girls.c0.p173"><s>A very sharp voice had addressed itself to the idle Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="174" id="girls.c0.p174"><s>"But, mademoiselle, you are doing nothing!</s> <s>This cannot for a moment be permitted.</s> <s>Pardonnez-moi, you know not the French?</s> <s>Here is a little easy lesson.</s> <s>Study it, mademoiselle, and don't let your eyes wander a moment from the page."</s> </p>

<p pid="175" id="girls.c0.p175"><s>Hester favoured Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier with a look of lofty contempt, but she received the well-thumbed lesson-book in absolute silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="176" id="girls.c0.p176"><s>At eight o'clock came breakfast, which was nicely served, and was very good and abundant.</s> <s>Hester was thoroughly hungry this morning, and did not feel so shy as the night before.</s> <s>She found herself seated between two strange girls, who talked to her a little and would have made themselves friendly had she at all encouraged them to do so.</s> <s>After breakfast came half an hour's recreation, when, the weather being very bad, the girls again assembled in the cosy play-room.</s> <s>Hester looked round eagerly for Cecil Temple, who greeted her with a kind smile, but did not ask her into her inclosure.</s> <s>Annie Forest was not present, and Hester breathed a sigh of relief at her absence.</s> <s>The half-hour devoted to recreation proved rather dull to the newcomer.</s> <s>Hester could not understand her present world.</s> <s>To the girl who had been brought up practically as an only child in the warm shelter of a home, the ways and doings of school-girl life were an absolute enigma.</s> </p>

<p pid="177" id="girls.c0.p177"><s>Hester had no idea of unbending or of making herself agreeable.</s> <s>The girls voted her to one another stiff and tiresome, and quickly left her to her own devices.</s> <s>She looked longingly at Cecil Temple; but Cecil, who could never be knowingly unkind to any one, was seizing the precious moments to write a letter to her father, and Hester presently wandered down the room and tried to take an interest in the little ones.</s> <s>From twelve to fifteen quite little children were in the school, and Hester wondered with a sort of vague half-pain if she might see any child among the group the least like Nan.</s> </p>

<p pid="178" id="girls.c0.p178"><s>"They will like to have me with them," she said to herself.</s> <s>"Poor little dots, they always like big girls to notice them, and didn't they make a fuss about Miss Forest last night!</s> <s>Well, Nan is fond enough of me, and little children find out so quickly what one is really like."</s> </p>

<p pid="179" id="girls.c0.p179"><s>Hester walked boldly into the group.</s> <s>The little dots were all as busy as bees, were not the least lonely, or the least shy, and very plainly gave the intruder to understand that they would prefer her room to her company.</s> <s>Hester was not proud with little children--she loved them dearly.</s> <s>Some of the smaller ones in question were beautiful little creatures, and her heart warmed to them for Nan's sake.</s> <s>She could not stoop to conciliate the older girls, but she could make an effort with the babies.</s> <s>She knelt on the floor and took up a headless doll.</s> </p>

<p pid="180" id="girls.c0.p180"><s>"I know a little girl who had a doll like that," she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="181" id="girls.c0.p181"><s>Here she paused and several pairs of eyes were fixed on her.</s> </p>

<p pid="182" id="girls.c0.p182"><s>"Poor dolly's b'oke," said the owner of the headless one in a tone of deep commiseration.</s> </p>

<p pid="183" id="girls.c0.p183"><s>"You _are_ such a breaker, you know, Annie," said Annie's little five-year-old sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="184" id="girls.c0.p184"><s>"Please tell us about the little girl what had the doll wifout the head," she proceeded, glancing at Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="185" id="girls.c0.p185" type="speech"><s>"Oh, it was taken to a hospital, and got back its head," said Hester quite cheerfully; <qs/>"it became quite well again, and was a more beautiful doll than ever."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="186" id="girls.c0.p186"><s>This announcement caused intense wonder and was certainly carrying the interest of all the little ones.</s> <s>Hester was deciding that the child who possessed the headless doll _had_ a look of Nan about her dark brown eyes, when suddenly there was a diversion--the play-room door was opened noisily, banged-to with a very loud report, and a gay voice sang out--</s> </p>

<p pid="187" id="girls.c0.p187"><s>"The fairy queen has just paid me a visit.</s> <s>Who wants sweeties from the fairy queen?"</s> </p>

<p pid="188" id="girls.c0.p188"><s>Instantly all the little feet had scrambled to the perpendicular, each pair of hands was clapped noisily, each little throat shouted a joyful--</s> </p>

<p pid="189" id="girls.c0.p189"><s>"Here comes Annie!"</s> </p>

<p pid="190" id="girls.c0.p190"><s>Annie Forest was surrounded, and Hester knelt alone on the hearth-rug.</s> </p>

<p pid="191" id="girls.c0.p191"><s>She felt herself colouring painfully--she did not fail to observe that two laughing eyes had fixed themselves with a momentary triumph on her face; then, snatching up a book, which happened to lie close, she seated herself with her back to all the girls, and her head bent over the page.</s> <s>It is quite doubtful whether she saw any of the words, but she was at least determined not to cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="192" id="girls.c0.p192"><s>The half-hour so wearisome to poor Hester came to an end, and the girls, conducted by Miss Danesbury, filed into the school-room and took their places in the different classes.</s> </p>

<p pid="194" id="girls.c0.p194"><s>Hester was not yet appointed to any place among these busy workers, but while she stood wondering, a little confused, and half intending to drop into an empty seat which happened to be close, Miss Danesbury came up to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="195" id="girls.c0.p195"><s>"Follow me, Miss Thornton," she said, and she conducted the young girl up the whole length of the great school-room, and pushed aside some baize curtains which concealed a second smaller room, where Mrs Willis sat before a desk.</s> </p>

<p pid="196" id="girls.c0.p196"><s>The head-mistress was no longer dressed in soft pearl-grey and Mechlin lace.</s> <s>She wore a black silk dress, and her white cap seemed to Hester to add a severe tone to her features.</s> <s>She neither shook hands with the new pupil nor kissed her, but said instantly in a bright though authoritative tone--</s> </p>

<p pid="197" id="girls.c0.p197"><s>"I must now find out as quickly as possible what you know, Hester, in order to place you in the most suitable class."</s> <s>Hester was a clever girl, and passed through the ordeal of a rather stiff examination with considerable ability.</s> <s>Mrs Willis pronounced her English and general information quite up to the usual standard for girls of her age--her French was deficient, but she showed some talent for German.</s> </p>

<p pid="198" id="girls.c0.p198"><s>"On the whole I am pleased with your general intelligence, and I think you have good capacities, Hester," she said in conclusion.</s> <s>"I shall ask Miss Good, our very accomplished English teacher, to place you in the third-class.</s> <s>You will have to work very hard, however, at your French, to maintain your place there.</s> <s>But Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier is kind and painstaking, and it rests with yourself to quickly acquire a conversational acquaintance with the language.</s> <s>You are aware that, except during recreation, you are never allowed to speak in any other tongue.</s> <s>Now, go back to the school-room, my dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="199" id="girls.c0.p199"><s>As Mrs Willis spoke she laid her finger on a little silver gong which stood by her side.</s> </p>

<p pid="200" id="girls.c0.p200" type="speech"><s>"One moment, please," said Hester, colouring crimson, <qs/>"I want to ask you a question, please."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="201" id="girls.c0.p201"><s>"Is it about your lessons?"</s> </p>

<p pid="202" id="girls.c0.p202"><s>"No--oh, no; it is--"</s> </p>

<p pid="203" id="girls.c0.p203" type="speech"><s>"Then pardon me, my dear," uttered the governess, <qs/>"I sit in my room every evening from eight to half-past, and I am then at liberty to see a pupil on any subject which is not trifling.</s> <s>Nothing but lessons are spoken of in lesson hours, Hester.</s> <s>Ah, here comes Miss Good.</s> <s>Miss Good, I should wish you to place Hester Thornton in the third-class.</s> <s>Her English is up to the average.</s> <s>I will see Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier about her at twelve o'clock."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="204" id="girls.c0.p204"><s>Hester followed the English teacher into the great school-room, took her place in the third-class, at the desk which was pointed out to her, was given a pile of new books, and was asked to attend to the history lesson which was then going on.</s> </p>

<p pid="205" id="girls.c0.p205"><s>Notwithstanding her confusion, a certain sense of soreness, and some indignation at what she considered Mrs Willis's altered manner, she acquitted herself with considerable spirit, and was pleased to see that her class companions regarded her with some respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="206" id="girls.c0.p206" type="speech"><s>An English literature lecture followed the history, and here again Hester acquitted herself with _eclat_.</s> <s>The subject to-day was <qs/>"Julius Caesar,"<qe/> and Hester had read Shakespeare's play over many times with her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="207" id="girls.c0.p207"><s>But when the hour came for foreign languages, her brief triumph ceased.</s> <s>Lower and lower did she fall in her school-fellows' estimation, as she stumbled through her truly English-French.</s> <s>Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier, who was a very fiery little woman, almost screamed at her--the girls coloured and nearly tittered.</s> <s>Hester hoped to recover her lost laurels in German, but by this time her head ached, and she did very little better in the German which she loved than in the French which she detested.</s> <s>At twelve o'clock she was relieved to find that school was over for the present, and she heard the English teacher's voice desiring the girls to go quickly to their rooms, and to assemble in five minutes' time in the great stone hall, equipped for their walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="208" id="girls.c0.p208"><s>The walk lasted for a little over an hour, and was a very dreary penance to poor Hester, as she was neither allowed to run, race, nor talk a word of English.</s> <s>She sighed heavily once or twice, and several of the girls who looked at her curiously agreed with Annie Forest that she was decidedly sulky.</s> <s>The walk was followed by dinner; then came half an hour of recreation in the delightful play-room, and eager chattering in the English tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="209" id="girls.c0.p209"><s>At three o'clock the school assembled once more; but now the studies were of a less severe character, and Hester spent one of her first happy half-hours over a drawing lesson.</s> <s>She had a great love for drawing, and felt some pride in the really beautiful copy which she was making of the stump of an old gnarled oak-tree.</s> <s>Her dismay, however, was proportionately great when the drawing-master drew his pencil right across her copy.</s> </p>

<p pid="210" id="girls.c0.p210"><s>"I particularly requested you not to sketch in any of the shadows, Miss Thornton.</s> <s>Did you not hear me say that my lesson to-day was in outline?</s> <s>I gave you a shaded piece to copy in outline--did you not understand?"</s> </p>

<p pid="211" id="girls.c0.p211"><s>"This is my first day at school," whispered back poor Hester, speaking in English in her distress.</s> <s>Whereupon the master smiled, and even forgot to report her for her transgression of the French tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="212" id="girls.c0.p212"><s>Hester spent the rest of that afternoon over her music lesson.</s> <s>The music-master was an irascible little German, but Hester played with some taste, and was therefore not too severely rapped over the knuckles.</s> </p>

<p pid="213" id="girls.c0.p213"><s>Then came tea and another half-hour of recreation, which was followed by two silent hours in the school-room, each girl bent busily over her books in preparation for the next day's work.</s> <s>Hester studied hard, for she had made up her mind to be the intellectual prodigy of the school.</s> <s>Even on this first day, miserable as it was, she had won a few plaudits for her quickness and powers of observation.</s> <s>How much better could she work when she had really fallen into the tone of the school, and understood the lessons which she was now so carefully preparing!</s> <s>During her busy day she had failed to notice one thing: namely, the absence of Annie Forest.</s> <s>Annie had not been in the school-room, had not been in the play-room; but now, as the clock struck eight, she entered the school-room with a listless expression, and took her place in the same class with Hester.</s> <s>Her eyes were heavy, as if she had been crying, and when a companion touched her, and gave her a sympathising glance, she shook her head with a sorrowful gesture, but did not speak.</s> <s>Glasses of milk and slices of bread and butler were now handed round to the girls, and Miss Danesbury asked if any one would like to see Mrs Willis before prayers.</s> <s>Hester half sprang to her feet, but then sat down again.</s> <s>Mrs Willis had annoyed her by refusing to break her rules and answer her question during lesson hours.</s> <s>No, the silly child resolved that she would not trouble Mrs Willis now.</s> </p>

<p pid="214" id="girls.c0.p214"><s>"No one to-night, then?" said Miss Danesbury, who had noticed Hester's movement.</s> </p>

<p pid="219" id="girls.c0.p219"><s>When Hester reached her bedroom after prayers on that second evening, she was dismayed to find that she no longer could consider the pretty little bedroom her own.</s> <s>It had not only an occupant, but an occupant who had left untidy traces of her presence on the floor, for a stocking lay in one direction and a muddy boot sprawled in another.</s> <s>The newcomer had herself got into bed, where she lay with a quantity of red hair tossed about on the pillow, and a heavy freckled face turned upward, with the eyes shut and the mouth slightly open.</s> </p>

<p pid="220" id="girls.c0.p220"><s>As Hester entered the room, from these parted lips came unmistakable and loud snores.</s> <s>She stood still dismayed.</s> </p>

<p pid="223" id="girls.c0.p223"><s>The newcomer had curled herself up comfortably in _her_ bed.</s> <s>Suddenly, to her surprise, a voice said very quietly, without a flicker of expression coming over the calm face, or the eyes even making an effort to open--</s> </p>

<p pid="224" id="girls.c0.p224"><s>"Are you my new school-mate?"</s> </p>

<p pid="225" id="girls.c0.p225" type="speech"><s>"Yes," said Hester, <qs/>"I am sorry to say I am."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="229" id="girls.c0.p229"><s>The heavy face was now only seen in profile, and Hester, knowing that Miss Danesbury would soon appear to put out the candle, had to hurry into the other bed as fast as she could; something impelled her, however, to take up the muddy boots with two very gingerly fingers, and place them outside the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="230" id="girls.c0.p230"><s>She slept better this second night, and was not quite so startled the next morning when the remorseless gong aroused her from slumber.</s> <s>The maid-servant came in as usual to light the candles, and to place two cans of hot water by the two wash-handstands.</s> </p>

<p pid="263" id="girls.c0.p263"><s>"I dare say," answered Hester.</s> <s>"You can see for yourself this morning what is on the table--I can only inform you that it was good enough for me, and that I don't remember what it was."</s> </p>

<p pid="264" id="girls.c0.p264" type="speech"><s>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Susan Drummond, <qs/>"I'm afraid she has a little temper of her own--poor little room-mate.</s> <s>I wonder if chocolate-creams would sweeten that little temper?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="273" id="girls.c0.p273"><s>In a few days Hester was accustomed to her new life.</s> <s>She fell into its routine, and in a certain measure won the respect of her fellow-pupils.</s> <s>She worked hard, and kept her place in class, and her French became a little more like the French tongue and a little less like the English.</s> <s>She showed marked ability in many of her other studies, and the mistresses and masters spoke well of her.</s> <s>After a fortnight spent at Lavender House, Hester had to acknowledge that the little Misses Bruce were right, and that school might be a really enjoyable place for some girls.</s> <s>She would not yet admit that it could be enjoyable for her.</s> <s>Hester was too shy, too proud, too exacting to be popular with her school-fellows.</s> <s>She knew nothing of school-girl life--she had never learned the great secret of success in all life's perplexities, the power to give and take.</s> <s>It never occurred to Hester to look over a hasty word, to take no notice of an envious or insolent look.</s> <s>As far as her lessons were concerned she was doing well; but the hardest lesson of all, the training of mind and character, which the daily companionship of her school-fellows alone could give her, in this lesson she was making no way.</s> <s>Each day she was shutting herself up more and more from all kindly advances, and the only one in the school whom she sincerely and cordially liked was gentle Cecil Temple.</s> </p>

<p pid="274" id="girls.c0.p274"><s>Mrs Willis had some ideas with regard to the training of her young people which were peculiarly her own.</s> <s>She had found them successful, and, during her thirty years' experience, had never seen reason to alter them.</s> <s>She was determined to give her girls a great deal more liberty than was accorded in most of the boarding-schools of her day.</s> <s>She never made what she called impossible rules; she allowed the girls full liberty to chatter in their bedrooms; she did not watch them during play-hours; she never read the letters they received, and only superintended the specimen home letter which each girl was required to write once a month.</s> <s>Other head-mistresses wondered at the latitude she allowed her girls, but she invariably replied--</s> </p>

<p pid="275" id="girls.c0.p275"><s>"I always find it works best to trust them.</s> <s>If a girl is found to be utterly untrustworthy.</s> <s>I don't expel her, but I request her parents to remove her to a more strict school."</s> </p>

<p pid="276" id="girls.c0.p276"><s>Mrs Willis also believed much in that quiet half-hour each evening, when the girls who cared to come could talk to her alone.</s> <s>On these occasions she always dropped the school-mistress and adopted the _role_ of the mother.</s> <s>With a very refractory pupil she spoke in the tenderest tones of remonstrance and affection at these times.</s> <s>If her words failed--if the discipline of the day and the gentle sympathy of these moments at night did not effect their purpose, she had yet another expedient--the vicar was asked to see the girl who would not yield to this motherly influence.</s> </p>

<p pid="277" id="girls.c0.p277" type="speech"><s>Mr Everard had very seldom taken Mrs Willis's place.</s> <s>As he said to her, <qs/>"Your influence must be the mainspring.</s> <s>At supreme moments I will help you with personal influence, but otherwise, except for my nightly prayers with your girls, and my weekly class, and the teachings which they with others hear from my lips Sunday after Sunday, they had better look to you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="278" id="girls.c0.p278"><s>The girls knew this rule well, and the one or two rare instances in the school history where the vicar had stepped in to interfere, were spoken of with bated breath and with intense awe.</s> </p>

<p pid="279" id="girls.c0.p279"><s>Mrs Willis had a great idea of bringing as much happiness as possible into young lives.</s> <s>It was with this idea that she had the quaint little compartments railed off in the play-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="280" id="girls.c0.p280" type="speech"><s>"For the elder girls," she would say, <qs/>"there is no pleasure so great as having, however small the spot, a little liberty hall of their own.</s> <s>In her compartment each girl is absolute monarch.</s> <s>No one can enter inside the little curtained rail without her permission.</s> <s>Here she can show her individual taste, her individual ideas.</s> <s>Here she can keep her most-prized possessions.</s> <s>In short, her compartment in the play-room is a little home to her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="281" id="girls.c0.p281"><s>The play-room, large as it was, admitted of only twenty compartments; these compartments were not easily won.</s> <s>No amount of cleverness attained them; they were altogether dependent on conduct.</s> <s>No girl could be the honourable owner of her own little drawing-room until she had distinguished herself by some special act of kindness and self-denial.</s> <s>Mrs Willis had no fixed rule on this subject.</s> <s>She alone gave away the compartments, and she often made choice of girls on whom she conferred this honour in a way which rather puzzled and surprised their fellows.</s> </p>

<p pid="282" id="girls.c0.p282"><s>When the compartment was won it was not a secure possession.</s> <s>To retain it depended also on conduct; and here again Mrs Willis was absolute in her sway.</s> <s>More than once the girls had entered the room in the morning to find some favourite's furniture removed and her little possessions taken carefully down from the walls, the girl herself alone knowing the reason for this sudden change.</s> <s>Annie Forest, who had been at Lavender House for four years, had once, for a solitary month of her existence, owned her own special drawing-room.</s> <s>She had obtained it as a reward for an act of heroism.</s> <s>One of the little pupils had set her pinafore on fire.</s> <s>There was no teacher present at the moment--the other girls had screamed and run for help, but Annie, very pale, had caught the little one in her arms and had crushed out the flames with her own hands.</s> <s>The child's life was spared, the child was not even hurt, but Annie was in the hospital for a week.</s> <s>At the end of a week she returned to the school-room and play-room as the heroine of the hour.</s> <s>Mrs Willis herself kissed her brow, and presented her in the midst of the approving smiles of her companions with the prettiest drawing-room of the sets.</s> <s>Annie retained her honourable post for one month.</s> </p>

<p pid="283" id="girls.c0.p283"><s>Never did the girls of Lavender House forget the delights of that month.</s> <s>The fantastic arrangements of the little drawing-room filled them with ecstasies.</s> <s>Annie was truly Japanese in her style--she was also intensely liberal in all her arrangements.</s> <s>In the tiny space of this little inclosure wild pranks were perpetrated, ceaseless jokes made up.</s> <s>From Annie's drawing-room issued peals of exquisite mirth.</s> <s>She gave afternoon tea from a Japanese set of tea-things.</s> <s>Outside her drawing-room always collected a crowd of girls, who tried to peep over the rail or to draw aside the curtains.</s> <s>Inside the sacred spot certainly reigned chaos, and one day Miss Danesbury had to fly to the rescue, for in a fit of mad mirth Annie herself had knocked down the little Japanese tea-table, the tea-pot and tea-things were in fragments on the floor, and the tea and milk poured in streams outside the curtains.</s> <s>Mrs Willis sent for Annie that evening, and Miss Forest retired from her interview with red eyes and a meek expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="284" id="girls.c0.p284" type="speech"><s>"Girls," she said, in confidence that night, <qs/>"good-bye to Japan.</s> <s>I gave her leave to do it--the care of an empire is more than I can manage."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="285" id="girls.c0.p285"><s>The next day the Japanese drawing-room had been handed over to another possessor, and Annie reigned as queen over her empire no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="286" id="girls.c0.p286"><s>Mrs Willis, anxious at all times that her girls should be happy, made special arrangements for their benefit on Sunday.</s> <s>Sunday was by no means dull at Lavender House--Sunday was totally unlike the six days which followed it.</s> <s>Even the stupidest girl could scarcely complain of the severity of Sunday lessons--even the merriest girl could scarcely speak of the day as dull.</s> <s>Mrs Willis made an invariable rule of spending all Sunday with her pupils.</s> <s>On this day she really unbent--on this day she was all during the long hours, what she was during the short half-hour on each evening in the week.</s> <s>On Sunday she neither reproved nor corrected.</s> <s>If punishment or correction were necessary, she deputed Miss Good or Miss Danesbury to take her place.</s> <s>On Sunday she sat with the little children round her knee, and the older girls clustering about her.</s> <s>Her gracious and motherly face was like a sun shining in the midst of these young girls.</s> <s>In short, she was like the personified form of Goodness in their midst.</s> <s>It was necessary, therefore, that all those who wished to do right should be happy on Sunday, and only those few who deliberately preferred evil should shrink from the brightness of this day.</s> </p>

<p pid="287" id="girls.c0.p287" type="speech"><s>It is astonishing how much a sympathising and guiding spirit can effect.</s> <s>The girls at Lavender House thought Sunday the shortest day in the week.</s> <s>There were no unoccupied or dull moments--school toil was forgotten--school punishment ceased, to be resumed again if necessary on Monday morning.</s> <s>The girls in their best dresses could chatter freely in English--they could read their favourite books--they could wander about the house as they pleased: for on Sunday the two baize doors were always wide-open, and Mrs Willis's own private suite of rooms was ready to receive them.</s> <s>If the day was fine they walked to church, each choosing her own companion for the pleasant walk; if the day was wet there was service in the chapel, Mr Everard always conducting either morning or evening prayers.</s> <s>In the afternoon the girls were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased, but after tea there always came a delightful hour, when the elder girls retired with their mistress into her own special boudoir, and she either told them stories or sang to them as only she could sing.</s> <s>At sixty years of age Mrs Willis still possessed the most sympathetic and touching voice those girls had ever listened to.</s> <s>Hester Thornton broke down completely on her first Sunday at Lavender House when she heard her school-mistress sing <qs/>"The Better Land."<qe/></s> <s>No one remarked on her tears, but two people saw them; for her mistress kissed her tenderly that night, and said a few strong words of help and encouragement, and Annie Forest, who made no comment, had also seen them, and wondered vaguely if this new and disagreeable pupil had a heart after all.</s> </p>

<p pid="288" id="girls.c0.p288"><s>On Sunday night Mrs Willis herself went round to each little bed and gave a mother-kiss to each of her pupils--a mother-kiss and a murmured blessing; and in many breasts resolves were then formed which were to help the girls through the coming week.</s> <s>Some of these resolves, made not in their own strength, bore fruit in long after-years.</s> <s>There is no doubt that very few girls who lived long enough at Lavender House ever in after-days found their Sundays dull.</s> </p>

<p pid="289" id="girls.c0.p289"><s>CHAPTER TEN.</s> <s>VARIETIES.</s> </p>

<p pid="290" id="girls.c0.p290"><s>Without any doubt, wild, naughty, impulsive Annie Forest was the most popular girl in the school.</s> <s>She was always in scrapes--she was scarcely ever out of hot water--her promises of amendment were truly like the proverbial pie-crust: but she was so lovable, so kind-hearted, so saucy and piquant and pretty, that very few could resist the nameless charm which she possessed.</s> <s>The little ones adored Annie, who was kindness itself to them; the bigger girls could not help admiring her fearlessness and courage; the best and noblest girls in the school tried to influence her for good.</s> <s>She was more or less an object of interest to every one; her courage was of just the sort to captivate school-girls, and her moral weakness was not observed by these inexperienced young eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="291" id="girls.c0.p291"><s>Hester alone, of all the girls who for a long time had come to Lavender House, failed to see any charm in Annie.</s> <s>She began by considering her ill-bred, and when she found she was the school favourite, she tossed her proud little head and determined that she for one would never be subjugated by such a naughty girl.</s> <s>Hester could read character with tolerable clearness; she was an observant child--very observant, and very thoughtful for her twelve years; and as the little witch Annie had failed to throw any spell over her, she saw her faults far more clearly than did her companions.</s> <s>There is no doubt that this brilliant, charming, and naughty Annie had heaps of faults; she had no perseverance; she was all passion and impulse; she could be the kindest of the kind, but from sheer thoughtlessness and wildness she often inflicted severe pain, even on those she loved best.</s> <s>Annie very nearly worshipped Mrs Willis, she had the most intense adoration for her, she respected her beyond any other human being.</s> <s>There were moments when the impulsive and hot-headed child felt that she could gladly lay down her life for her school-mistress.</s> <s>Once the mistress was ill, and Annie curled herself up all night outside her door, thereby breaking rules, and giving herself a severe cold; but her passion and agony were so great that she could only be soothed by at last stealing into the darkened room and kissing the face she loved.</s> </p>

<p pid="292" id="girls.c0.p292"><s>"Prove your love to me, Annie, by going downstairs and keeping the school rules as perfectly as possible," whispered the teacher.</s> </p>

<p pid="293" id="girls.c0.p293"><s>"I will--I will never break a rule again as long as I live, if you get better, Mrs Willis," responded the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="294" id="girls.c0.p294"><s>She ran downstairs with her resolves strong within her, and yet in half an hour she was reprimanded for wilful and desperate disobedience.</s> </p>

<p pid="295" id="girls.c0.p295"><s>One day Cecil Temple had invited a select number of friends to afternoon tea in her little drawing-room.</s> <s>It was the Wednesday half-holiday, and Cecil's tea, poured into the tiniest cups and accompanied by thin wafer biscuits, was of the most _recherche_ quality.</s> <s>Cecil had invited Hester Thornton, and a tall girl who belonged to the first-class and whose name was Dora Russell, to partake of this dainty beverage.</s> <s>They were sitting round the tiny tea-table, on little red stools with groups of flowers artistically painted on them, and were all three conducting themselves in a most ladylike and refined manner, when Annie Forest's curly head and saucy face popped over the inclosure, and her voice said eagerly--</s> </p>

<p pid="296" id="girls.c0.p296"><s>"Oh, may I be permitted to enter the shrine?"</s> </p>

<p pid="297" id="girls.c0.p297"><s>"Certainly, Annie," said Cecil, in her most cordial tones.</s> <s>"I have got another cup and saucer, and there is a little tea left in the tea-pot."</s> </p>

<p pid="298" id="girls.c0.p298"><s>Annie came in, and ensconced herself cosily on the floor.</s> <s>It did not matter in the least to her that Hester Thornton's brow grew dark, and that Miss Russell suddenly froze into complete indifference to all her surroundings.</s> <s>Annie was full of a subject which excited her very much; she had suddenly discovered that she wanted to give Mrs Willis a present, and she wished to know if any of the girls would like to join her.</s> </p>

<p pid="299" id="girls.c0.p299"><s>"I will give her the present this day week," said excitable Annie.</s> <s>"I have quite made up my mind.</s> <s>Will any one join me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="300" id="girls.c0.p300"><s>"But there is nothing special about this day week, Annie," said Miss Temple.</s> <s>"It will neither be Mrs Willis's birthday, nor Christmas Day, nor New Year's Day, nor Easter Day.</s> <s>Next Wednesday will be just like any other Wednesday.</s> <s>Why should we make Mrs Willis a present?"</s> </p>

<p pid="301" id="girls.c0.p301"><s>"Oh, because she looks as if she wanted one, poor dear.</s> <s>I thought she looked sad this morning; her eyes drooped and her mouth was down at the corners.</s> <s>I am sure she's wanting something from us all by now, just to show that we love her, you know."</s> </p>

<p pid="302" id="girls.c0.p302"><s>"Pshaw!" here burst from Hester's lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="303" id="girls.c0.p303" type="speech"><s>"Why do you say that?" said Annie, turning round with her bright eyes flashing.</s> <s>"You've no right to be so contemptuous when I speak about our--our head-mistress.</s> <s>Oh, Cecil," she continued, <qs/>"do let us give her a little surprise--some spring flowers, or something just to show her that we love her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="304" id="girls.c0.p304"><s>"But _you_ don't love her," said Hester, stoutly.</s> </p>

<p pid="305" id="girls.c0.p305"><s>Here was throwing down the gauntlet with a vengeance!</s> <s>Annie sprang to her feet and confronted Hester with a whole torrent of angry words.</s> <s>Hester firmly maintained her position.</s> <s>She said over and over again that love proved itself by deeds, not by words; that if Annie learned her lessons, and obeyed the school rules, she would prove her affection for Mrs Willis far more than by empty protestations.</s> <s>Hester's words were true, but they were uttered in an unkind spirit, and the very flavour of truth which they possessed caused them to enter Annie's heart and to wound her deeply.</s> <s>She turned, not red, but very white, and her large and lovely eyes grew misty with unshed tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="306" id="girls.c0.p306"><s>"You are cruel," she gasped, rather than spoke, and then she pushed aside the curtains of Cecil's compartment and walked out of the play-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="307" id="girls.c0.p307"><s>There was a dead silence among the three girls when she left them.</s> <s>Hester's heart was still hot, and she was still inclined to maintain her own position, and to believe she had done right in speaking in so severe a tone to Annie.</s> <s>But even she had been made a little uneasy by the look of deep suffering which had suddenly transformed Annie's charming childish face into that of a troubled and pained woman.</s> <s>She sat down meekly on her little three-legged stool and, taking up her tiny cup and saucer, sipped some of the cold tea.</s> </p>

<p pid="308" id="girls.c0.p308"><s>Cecil Temple was the first to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="309" id="girls.c0.p309"><s>"How could you?" she said, in an indignant voice for her.</s> <s>"Annie is not the girl to be driven, and, in any case, it is not for you to correct her.</s> <s>Oh, Mrs Willis would have been so pained had she heard you--you were not _kind_, Miss Thornton.</s> <s>There, I don't wish to be rude, but I fear I must leave you and Miss Russell--I must try and find Annie."</s> </p>

<p pid="310" id="girls.c0.p310" type="speech"><s>"I'm going back to my own drawing-room," said Miss Russell, rising to her feet.</s> <s>"Perhaps," she added, turning round with a very gracious smile to Hester, <qs/>"you will come and see me there, after tea, this evening."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="311" id="girls.c0.p311"><s>Miss Russell drew aside the curtains of Cecil Temple's little room, and disappeared.</s> <s>Hester, with her eyes full of tears, now turned eagerly to Cecil.</s> </p>

<p pid="312" id="girls.c0.p312" type="speech"><s>"Forgive me, Cecil," she exclaimed.</s> <s>"I did not mean to be unkind, but it is really quite ridiculous the way you all spoil that girl--you know as well as I do that she is a very naughty girl.</s> <s>I suppose it is because of her pretty face," continued Hester, <qs/>"that you are all so unjust, and so blind to her faults."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="313" id="girls.c0.p313"><s>"You are prejudiced the other way, Hester," said Cecil in a more gentle tone.</s> <s>"You have disliked Annie from the first.</s> <s>There, don't keep me--I must go to her now.</s> <s>There is no knowing what harm your words may have done.</s> <s>Annie is not like other girls.</s> <s>If you knew her story, you would perhaps be kinder to her."</s> </p>

<p pid="314" id="girls.c0.p314"><s>Cecil then ran out of her drawing-room, leaving Hester in sole possession of the little tea-things and the three-legged stools.</s> <s>She sat and thought for some time; she was a girl with a great deal of obstinacy in her nature, and she was not disposed to yield her own point, even to Cecil Temple; but Cecil's words had, nevertheless, made some impression on her.</s> </p>

<p pid="315" id="girls.c0.p315"><s>At tea-time that night, Annie and Cecil entered the room together.</s> <s>Annie's eyes were as bright as stars, and her usually pale cheeks glowed with a deep colour.</s> <s>She had never looked prettier--she had never looked so defiant, so mischievous, so utterly reckless.</s> <s>Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier fired indignant French at her across the table.</s> <s>Annie answered respectfully, and became demure in a moment; but even in the short instant in which the governess was obliged to lower her eyes to her plate, she had thrown a look so irresistibly comic at her companions, that several of them had tittered aloud.</s> <s>Not once did she glance at Hester although she occasionally looked boldly in her direction; but when she did so, her versatile face assumed a blank expression, as if she were seeing nothing.</s> <s>When tea was over, Dora Russell surprised the members of her own class by walking straight up to Hester, putting her hand inside her arm, and leading her off to her own very refined-looking little drawing-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="316" id="girls.c0.p316" type="speech"><s>"I want to tell you," she said, when the two girls found themselves inside the small inclosure, <qs/>"that I quite agree with you in your opinion of Miss Forest.</s> <s>I think you were very brave to speak to her as you did to-day.</s> <s>As a rule, I never trouble myself with what the little girls in the third-class do, and of course Annie seldom comes under my notice; but I think she is a decidedly spoiled child, and your rebuff will doubtless do her a great deal of good."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="317" id="girls.c0.p317"><s>These words of commendation, coming from tall and dignified Miss Russell, completely turned poor Hester's head.</s> </p>

<p pid="318" id="girls.c0.p318" type="speech"><s>"Oh, I am so glad you think so!" she stammered, colouring high with pleasure.</s> <s>"You see," she added, assuming a little tone of extra refinement, <qs/>"at home I always associated with girls who were perfect ladies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="319" id="girls.c0.p319"><s>"Yes, any one can see that," remarked Miss Russell approvingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="320" id="girls.c0.p320" type="speech"><s>"And I do think Annie underbred," continued Hester.</s> <s>"I cannot understand," she added, <qs/>"why Miss Temple likes her so much."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="321" id="girls.c0.p321"><s>"Oh, Cecil is so amiable; she sees good in every one," answered Miss Russell.</s> <s>"Annie is evidently not a lady, and I am glad at last to find some one of the girls who belong to the middle school capable of discerning this fact.</s> <s>Of course, we of the first-class have nothing whatever to say to Miss Forest, but I really think Mrs Willis is not acting quite fairly by the other girls when she allows a young person of that description into the school.</s> <s>I wish to assure you, Miss Thornton, that you have at least my sympathy, and I shall be very pleased to see you in my drawing-room now and then."</s> </p>

<p pid="322" id="girls.c0.p322" type="speech"><s>As these last words were uttered, both girls were conscious of a little rustling sound not far away.</s> <s>Miss Russell drew back her curtain, and asked very sharply, <qs/>"Who is there?"<qe/> but no one replied, nor was there any one in sight, for the girls who did not possess compartments were congregated at the other end of the long play-room, listening to stories which Emma Marshall, a clever elder girl, was relating for their benefit.</s> </p>

<p pid="323" id="girls.c0.p323"><s>Miss Russell talked on indifferent subjects to Hester, and at the end of the half-hour the two entered the class-room side by side, Hester's little head a good deal turned by this notice from one of the oldest girls in the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="324" id="girls.c0.p324"><s>As the two walked together into the school-room, Susan Drummond, who, tall as she was, was only in the fourth class, rushed up to Miss Forest, and whispered something in her ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="343" id="girls.c0.p343"><s>The next morning, when the whole school were assembled, and all the classes were getting ready for the real work of the day, Miss Good, the English teacher, stepped to the head of the room, and, holding a neatly bound volume of "Jane Eyre" in her hand, begged to know to whom it belonged.</s> <s>There was a hush of astonishment when she held up the little book, for all the girls knew well that this special volume was not allowed for school literature.</s> </p>

<p pid="344" id="girls.c0.p344"><s>"The house maid who dusts the school-room found this book on the floor," continued the teacher.</s> <s>"It lay beside a desk near the top of the room.</s> <s>I see the name has been torn out, so I cannot tell who is the owner.</s> <s>I must request her, however, to step forward and take possession of her property.</s> <s>If there is the slightest attempt at concealment, the whole matter will be laid before Mrs Willis at noon to-day."</s> </p>

<p pid="345" id="girls.c0.p345"><s>When Miss Good had finished her little speech, she held up the book in its green binding and looked down the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="346" id="girls.c0.p346"><s>Hester did not know why her heart beat--no one glanced at her, no one regarded her; all eyes were fixed on Miss Good, who stood with a severe, unsmiling, but expectant face.</s> </p>

<p pid="347" id="girls.c0.p347" type="speech"><s>"Come, young ladies," she said, <qs/>"the owner has surely no difficulty in recognising her own property.</s> <s>I give you exactly thirty seconds more; then, if no one claims the book, I place the affair in Mrs Willis's hands."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="348" id="girls.c0.p348"><s>Just then there was a stir among the girls in the head class.</s> <s>A tall girl in dove-coloured cashmere, with a smooth head of golden hair, and a fair face which was a good deal flushed at this moment, stepped to the front, and said in a clear and perfectly modulated voice--</s> </p>

<p pid="349" id="girls.c0.p349"><s>"I had no idea of concealing the fact that `Jane Eyre' belongs to me.</s> <s>I was only puzzled for a moment to know how it got on the floor.</s> <s>I placed it carefully in my desk last night.</s> <s>I think this circumstance ought to be inquired into."</s> </p>

<p pid="350" id="girls.c0.p350" type="speech"><s>"Oh! oh!" came from several suppressed voices here and there through the room; <qs/>"whoever would have supposed that Dora Russell would be obliged to humble herself in this way?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="351" id="girls.c0.p351" type="speech"><s>"Attention, young ladies!" said Miss Good; <qs/>"no talking, if you please.</s> <s>Do I understand, Miss Russell, that `Jane Eyre' is yours?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="352" id="girls.c0.p352"><s>"Yes, Miss Good."</s> </p>

<p pid="353" id="girls.c0.p353"><s>"Why did you keep it in your desk--were you reading it during preparation?"</s> </p>

<p pid="354" id="girls.c0.p354"><s>"On, yes, certainly."</s> </p>

<p pid="355" id="girls.c0.p355"><s>"You are, of course, aware that you were breaking two very stringent rules of the school.</s> <s>In the first place, no story-books are allowed to be concealed in a school-desk, or to be read during preparation.</s> <s>In the second place, this special book is not allowed to be read at any time in Lavender House.</s> <s>You know these rules, Miss Russell?"</s> </p>

<p pid="356" id="girls.c0.p356"><s>"Yes, Miss Good."</s> </p>

<p pid="357" id="girls.c0.p357"><s>"I must retain the book--you can return now to your place in class."</s> </p>

<p pid="358" id="girls.c0.p358"><s>Miss Russell bowed sedately, and with an apparently unmoved face, except for the slightly deepened glow on her smooth cheek, resumed her interrupted work.</s> </p>

<p pid="359" id="girls.c0.p359"><s>Lessons went off as usual, but during recreation the mystery of the discovered book was largely discussed by the girls.</s> <s>As is the custom of school-girls, they took violent sides in the matter--some rejoicing in Dora's downfall, some pitying her intensely.</s> <s>Hester was, of course, one of Miss Russell's champions, and she looked at her with tender sympathy when she came with her haughty and graceful manner into the school-room, and her little heart beat with a vague hope that Dora might turn to her for sympathy.</s> </p>

<p pid="360" id="girls.c0.p360"><s>Dora, however, did nothing of the kind.</s> <s>She refused to discuss the affair with her companions, and none of them quite knew what Mrs Willis said to her, or what special punishment was inflicted on the proud girl.</s> <s>Several of her school-fellows expected that Dora's drawing-room would be taken away from her, but she still retained it; and after a few days the affair of the book was almost forgotten.</s> </p>

<p pid="361" id="girls.c0.p361"><s>There was, however, an uncomfortable and an uneasy spirit abroad in the school.</s> <s>Susan Drummond, who was certainly one of the most uninteresting girls in Lavender House, was often seen walking with and talking to Miss Forest.</s> <s>Sometimes Annie shook her pretty head over Susan's remarks; sometimes she listened to her; sometimes she laughed and spoke eagerly for a moment or two, and appeared to acquiesce in suggestions which her companion urged.</s> </p>

<p pid="362" id="girls.c0.p362"><s>Annie had always been the soul of disorder--of wild pranks, of naughty and disobedient deeds--but, hitherto, in all her wildness she had never intentionally hurt any one but herself.</s> <s>Hers was a giddy and thoughtless, but by no means a bitter tongue--she thought well of all her school-fellows--and on occasions she could be self-sacrificing and good-natured to a remarkable extent.</s> <s>The girls of the head class took very little notice of Annie, but her other school-companions, as a rule, succumbed to her sunny, bright, and witty ways.</s> <s>She offended them a hundred times a day, and a hundred times a day was forgiven.</s> <s>Hester was the first girl in the third-class who had ever persistently disliked Annie and Annie, after making one or two overtures of friendship, began to return Miss Thornton's aversion; but she had never cordially hated her until the day they met in Cecil Temple's drawing-room and Hester had wounded Annie in her tenderest part by doubting her affection for Mrs Willis.</s> </p>

<p pid="363" id="girls.c0.p363"><s>Since that day there was a change very noticeable in Annie Forest--she was not so gay as formerly, but she was a great deal more mischievous-- she was not nearly so daring, but she was capable now of little actions slight in themselves, which yet were calculated to cause mischief and real unhappiness.</s> <s>Her sudden friendship with Susan Drummond did her no good, and she persistently avoided all intercourse with Cecil Temple, who hitherto had influenced her in the right direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="364" id="girls.c0.p364"><s>The incident of the green book had passed with no apparent result of grave importance, but the spirit of mischief which had caused this book to be found was by no means asleep in the school.</s> <s>Pranks were played in a most mysterious fashion with the girls' properties.</s> </p>

<p pid="365" id="girls.c0.p365"><s>Hester herself was the very next victim.</s> <s>She too was a neat and orderly child--she was clever and thoroughly enjoyed her school work.</s> <s>She was annoyed, therefore, and dreadfully puzzled, by discovering one morning that her neat French exercise-book was disgracefully blotted, and one page torn across.</s> <s>She was severely reprimanded by Mdlle.</s> <s>Perier for such gross untidiness and carelessness, and when she assured the governess that she knew nothing whatever of the circumstance, that she was never guilty of blots, and had left the book in perfect order the night before, the French lady only shrugged her shoulders, made an expressive gesture with her eyebrows, and plainly showed Hester that she thought the less she said on that subject the better.</s> </p>

<p pid="366" id="girls.c0.p366"><s>Hester was required to write out her exercise again, and she fancied she saw a triumphant look in Annie Forest's eyes as she left the school-room, where poor Hester was obliged to remain to undergo her unmerited punishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="367" id="girls.c0.p367"><s>"Cecil," called Hester, in a passionate and eager voice, as Miss Temple was passing her place.</s> </p>

<p pid="368" id="girls.c0.p368"><s>Cecil paused for a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="369" id="girls.c0.p369"><s>"What is it, Hetty?--oh, I am so sorry you must stay in this lovely bright day."</s> </p>

<p pid="370" id="girls.c0.p370" type="speech"><s>"I have done nothing wrong," said Hester; <qs/>"I never blotted this exercise-book; I never tore this page.</s> <s>It is most unjust not to believe my word; it is most unjust to punish me for what I have not done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="371" id="girls.c0.p371"><s>Miss Temple's face looked puzzled and sad.</s> </p>

<p pid="372" id="girls.c0.p372" type="speech"><s>"I must not stay to talk to you now, Hester," she whispered; <qs/>"I am breaking the rules.</s> <s>You can come to my drawing-room by-and-by, and we will discuss this matter."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="373" id="girls.c0.p373"><s>But Hester and Cecil, talk as they would, could find no solution to the mystery.</s> <s>Cecil absolutely refused to believe that Annie Forest had anything to do with the matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="374" id="girls.c0.p374" type="speech"><s>"No," she said, <qs/>"such deceit is not in Annie's nature.</s> <s>I would do anything to help you, Hester; but I can't, and I won't, believe that Annie tried deliberately to do you any harm."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="375" id="girls.c0.p375" type="speech"><s>"I am quite certain she did," retorted Hester, <qs/>"and from this moment I refuse to speak to her until she confesses what she has done and apologises to me.</s> <s>Indeed, I have a great mind to go and tell everything to Mrs Willis."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="376" id="girls.c0.p376" type="speech"><s>"Oh, I would not do that," said Cecil; <qs/>"none of your school-fellows would forgive you if you charged such a favourite as Annie with a crime which you cannot in the least prove against her.</s> <s>You must be patient, Hester, and if you are, I will take your part, and try to get at the bottom of the mystery."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="377" id="girls.c0.p377"><s>Cecil, however, failed to do so.</s> <s>Annie laughed when the affair was discussed in her presence, but her clear eyes looked as innocent as the day, and nothing would induce Cecil to doubt Miss Forest's honour.</s> </p>

<p pid="378" id="girls.c0.p378" type="speech"><s>The mischievous sprite, however, who was sowing such seeds of unhappiness in the hitherto peaceful school was not satisfied with two deeds of daring; for a week afterwards Cecil Temple found a book of Mrs Browning's, out of which she was learning a piece for recitation, with its cover half torn off, and, still worse, a caricature of Mrs Willis sketched with some cleverness and a great deal of malice on the title-page.</s> <s>On the very same morning, Dora Russell, on opening her desk, was seen to throw up her hands with a gesture of dismay.</s> <s>The neat composition she had finished the night before was not to be seen in its accustomed place, but in a corner of the desk were two bulky and mysterious parcels, one of which contained a great junk of rich plum-cake, and the other some very sticky and messy <qs/>"Turkish delight;"<qe/> while the paper which enveloped these luxuries was found to be that on which the missing composition was written.</s> <s>Dora's face grew very white--she forgot the ordinary rules of the school, and, leaving her class, walked down the room, and interrupted Miss Good, who was beginning to instruct the third-class in English grammar.</s> </p>

<p pid="379" id="girls.c0.p379"><s>"Will you please come and see something in my desk, Miss Good?" she said in a voice which trembled with excitement.</s> </p>

<p pid="419" id="girls.c0.p419"><s>Cecil's face was in many ways a remarkable one.</s> <s>Her soft brown eyes were generally filled with a steadfast and kindly ray.</s> <s>Gentleness was her special prerogative, but there was nothing weak about her--hers was the gentleness of a strong and pure and noble soul.</s> <s>To know Cecil was to love her.</s> <s>She was a motherless girl, and the only child of a most indulgent father.</s> <s>Colonel Temple was now in India, and Cecil was to finish her education under Mrs Willis's care, and then, if necessary, to join her father.</s> </p>

<p pid="420" id="girls.c0.p420"><s>Mrs Willis had always taken a special interest in this girl.</s> <s>She admired her for her great moral worth.</s> <s>Cecil was not particularly clever, but she was so studious, so painstaking, that she always kept a high place in class.</s> <s>She was without doubt a religious girl, but there was nothing of the prig about her.</s> <s>She was not, however, ashamed of her religion, and, if the fitting occasion arose, she was fearless in expressing her opinion.</s> </p>

<p pid="421" id="girls.c0.p421" type="speech"><s>Mrs Willis used to call Cecil her <qs/>"little standard-bearer,"<qe/> and she relied greatly on her influence over the third-class girls.</s> <s>Mrs Willis considered the third-class, perhaps, the most important in the school.</s> <s>She was often heard to say--</s> </p>

<p pid="422" id="girls.c0.p422"><s>"The girls who fill this class have come to a turning-point--they have come to the age when resolves may be made for life, and kept.</s> <s>The good third-class girl is very unlikely to degenerate as she passes through the second and first classes.</s> <s>On the other hand, there is very little hope that the idle or mischievous third-class girl will mend her ways as she goes higher in the school."</s> </p>

<p pid="423" id="girls.c0.p423"><s>Mrs Willis's steps were very slow, and her thoughts extremely painful, as she entered the chapel to-day.</s> <s>Had any one else offered her defiance she would have known how to deal with the culprit, but Cecil would never have acted as she did without the strongest motive, and Mrs Willis felt more sorrowful than angry as she sat down by the side of her favourite pupil.</s> </p>

<p pid="424" id="girls.c0.p424"><s>"I have kept you waiting longer than I intended, my dear," she said.</s> <s>"I was unexpectedly interrupted, and I am sorry; but you have had more time to think, Cecil."</s> </p>

<p pid="425" id="girls.c0.p425"><s>"Yes, I have thought," answered Cecil, in a very low tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="426" id="girls.c0.p426" type="speech"><s>"And, perhaps," continued her governess, <qs/>"in this quiet and beautiful and sacred place, my dear pupil has also prayed?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="427" id="girls.c0.p427"><s>"I have prayed," said Cecil.</s> </p>

<p pid="428" id="girls.c0.p428"><s>"Then you have been guided, Cecil," said Mrs Willis in a tone of relief.</s> <s>"We do not come to God in our distress without being shown the right way.</s> <s>Your doubts have been removed, Cecil; you can now speak fully to me; can you not, dear?"</s> </p>

<p pid="429" id="girls.c0.p429"><s>"I have asked God to tell me what is right," said Cecil.</s> <s>"I don't pretend to know.</s> <s>I am very much puzzled.</s> <s>It seems to me that more good would be done if I concealed what you asked me to confess in the school-room.</s> <s>My own feeling is that I ought not to tell you.</s> <s>I know this is great disobedience, and I am quite willing to receive any punishment you think right to give me.</s> <s>Yes, I think I am quite willing to receive _any_ punishment."</s> </p>

<p pid="430" id="girls.c0.p430"><s>Mrs Willis put her hand on Cecil's shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="431" id="girls.c0.p431" type="speech"><s>"Ordinary punishments are not likely to affect you, Cecil," she said; <qs/>"on you I have no idea of inflicting extra lessons, or depriving you of half-holidays, or even taking away your drawing-room.</s> <s>But there is something else you must lose, and that I know will touch you deeply--I must remove from you my confidence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="432" id="girls.c0.p432"><s>Cecil's face grew very pale.</s> </p>

<p pid="433" id="girls.c0.p433"><s>"And your love, too?" she said, looking up with imploring eyes:</s> <s>"oh, surely not your love as well?"</s> </p>

<p pid="434" id="girls.c0.p434" type="speech"><s>"I ask you frankly, Cecil," replied Mrs Willis, <qs/>"can perfect love exist without perfect confidence?</s> <s>I would not willingly deprive you of my love, but of necessity the love I have hitherto felt for you must be altered--in short, the old love which enabled me to rest on you and trust you, will cease."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="435" id="girls.c0.p435"><s>Cecil covered her face with her hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="436" id="girls.c0.p436" type="speech"><s>"This punishment is very cruel," she said.</s> <s>"You are right; it reaches down to my very heart.</s> <s>But," she added, looking up with a strong and sweet light in her face, <qs/>"I will try and bear it, and some day you will understand."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="437" id="girls.c0.p437" type="speech"><s>"Listen, Cecil," said Mrs Willis, <qs/>"you have just told me you have prayed to God, and have asked Him to show you the right path.</s> <s>Now, my dear, suppose we kneel together, and both of us ask Him to show us the way out of this difficult matter.</s> <s>I want to be guided to use the right words with you, Cecil.</s> <s>You want to be guided to receive the instruction which I, as your teacher and mother-friend, would give you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="438" id="girls.c0.p438"><s>Cecil and Mrs Willis both knelt down, and the head-mistress said a few words in a voice of great earnestness and entreaty; then they resumed their seats.</s> </p>

<p pid="439" id="girls.c0.p439" type="speech"><s>"Now, Cecil," said Mrs Willis, <qs/>"you must remember in listening to me that I am speaking to you as I believe God wishes me to.</s> <s>If I can convince you that you are doing wrong in concealing what you know from me, will you act as I wish in the matter?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="440" id="girls.c0.p440"><s>"I long to be convinced," said Cecil, in a low tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="441" id="girls.c0.p441"><s>"That is right, my dear; I can now speak to you with perfect freedom.</s> <s>My words you will remember, Cecil, are now, I firmly believe, directed by God; they are also the result of a large experience.</s> <s>I have trained many girls.</s> <s>I have watched the phases of thought in many young minds.</s> <s>Cecil, look at me.</s> <s>I can read you like a book."</s> </p>

<p pid="442" id="girls.c0.p442"><s>Cecil looked up expectantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="443" id="girls.c0.p443"><s>"Your motive for this concealment is as clear as the daylight, Cecil.</s> <s>You are keeping back what you know because you want to shield some one.</s> <s>Am I not right, my dear?"</s> <s>The colour flooded Cecil's pale face.</s> <s>She bent her head in silent assent, but her eyes were too full of tears, and her lips trembled too much to allow her to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="444" id="girls.c0.p444" type="speech"><s>"The girl you want to defend," continued Mrs Willis, in that clear patient voice of hers, <qs/>"is one whom you and I both love; is one for whom we both have prayed; is one for whom we would both gladly sacrifice ourselves if necessary--her name is--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="445" id="girls.c0.p445" type="speech"><s>"Oh, don't,<qs/>" said Cecil imploringly--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>don't say her name; you have no right to suspect her."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="446" id="girls.c0.p446"><s>"I must say her name, Cecil dear.</s> <s>If you suspect Annie Forest, why should not I?</s> <s>You do suspect her, do you not, Cecil?"</s> </p>

<p pid="447" id="girls.c0.p447"><s>Cecil began to cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="448" id="girls.c0.p448"><s>"I know it," continued Mrs Willis.</s> <s>"Now, Cecil, we will suppose, terrible as this suspicion is, fearfully as it pains us both, that Annie Forest _is_ guilty.</s> <s>We must suppose for the sake of my argument that this is the case.</s> <s>Do you not know, my dear Cecil, that you are doing the falsest, cruellest thing by dear Annie in trying to hide her sin from me?</s> <s>Suppose, just for the sake of our argument, that this cowardly conduct on Annie's part was never found out by me; what effect would it have on Annie herself?"</s> </p>

<p pid="449" id="girls.c0.p449"><s>"It would save her in the eyes of the school," said Cecil.</s> </p>

<p pid="450" id="girls.c0.p450"><s>"Just so, but God would know the truth.</s> <s>Her next downfall would be deeper.</s> <s>In short, Cecil, under the idea of friendship you would have done the cruellest thing in all the world for your friend."</s> </p>

<p pid="451" id="girls.c0.p451"><s>Cecil was quite silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="452" id="girls.c0.p452" type="speech"><s>"This is one way to look at it," continued Mrs Willis, <qs/>"but there are many other points from which this case ought to be viewed.</s> <s>You owe much to Annie, but not all--you have a duty to perform to your other school-fellows.</s> <s>You have a duty to perform to me.</s> <s>If you possess a clue which will enable me to convict Annie Forest of her sin, in common justice you have no right to withhold it.</s> <s>Remember that while she goes about free and unsuspected some other girl is under the ban--some other girl is watched and feared.</s> <s>You fail in your duty to your school-fellows when you keep back your knowledge, Cecil.</s> <s>When you refuse to trust me, you fail in your duty to your mistress; for I cannot stamp out this evil and wicked thing from our midst unless I know all.</s> <s>When you conceal your knowledge, you ruin the character of the girl you seek to shield.</s> <s>When you conceal your knowledge, you go against God's express wish.</s> <s>There--I have spoken to you as He directed me to speak."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="453" id="girls.c0.p453"><s>Cecil suddenly sprang to her feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="454" id="girls.c0.p454"><s>"I never thought of all these things," she said.</s> <s>"You are right, but it is very hard, and mine is only a suspicion.</s> <s>Oh, do be tender to her, and--forgive me--may I go away now?"</s> </p>

<p pid="455" id="girls.c0.p455"><s>As she spoke, she pulled out the torn copy of Mrs Browning, laid it on her teacher's lap, and ran swiftly out of the chapel.</s> </p>

<p pid="456" id="girls.c0.p456"><s>CHAPTER THIRTEEN.</s> <s>TALKING OVER THE MYSTERY.</s> </p>

<p pid="457" id="girls.c0.p457"><s>Annie Forest sitting in the midst of a group of eager admirers, was chatting volubly.</s> <s>Never had she been in higher spirits, never had her pretty face looked more bright and daring.</s> </p>

<p pid="458" id="girls.c0.p458"><s>Cecil Temple, coming into the play-room, started when she saw her.</s> <s>Annie, however, instantly rose from the low hassock on which she had perched herself and, running up to Cecil, put her hand through her arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="459" id="girls.c0.p459" type="speech"><s>"We are all discussing the mystery, darling," said she; <qs/>"we have discussed it, and literally torn it to shreds, and yet never got at the kernel.</s> <s>We have guessed and guessed what your motive can be in concealing the truth from Mrs Willis, and we all unanimously vote that you are a dear old martyr, and that you have some admirable reason for keeping back the truth.</s> <s>You cannot think what an excitement we are in-- even Susy Drummond has stayed awake to listen to our chatter.</s> <s>Now, Cecil, do come and sit here in this most inviting little armchair, and tell us what our dear head-mistress said to you in the chapel.</s> <s>It did seem so awful to send you to the chapel, poor dear Cecil."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="460" id="girls.c0.p460"><s>Cecil stood perfectly still and quiet while Annie was pouring out her torrent of eager words; her eyes, indeed, did not quite meet her companion's, but she allowed Annie to retain her clasp of her arm, and she evidently listened with attention to her words.</s> <s>Now, however, when Miss Forest tried to draw her into the midst of the eager and animated group who sat round the play-room fire, she hesitated and looked longingly in the direction of her peaceful little drawing-room.</s> <s>Her hesitation, however, was but momentary.</s> <s>Quite silently she walked with Annie down the large play-room and entered the group of girls.</s> </p>

<p pid="461" id="girls.c0.p461"><s>"Here's your throne, Queen Cecil," said Annie trying to push her into the little armchair; but Cecil would not seat herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="462" id="girls.c0.p462"><s>"How nice that you have come, Cecil!" said Mary Pierce, a second-class girl.</s> <s>"I really think, we all think, that you were very brave to stand out against Mrs Willis as you did.</s> <s>Of course we are devoured with curiosity to know what it means; aren't we, Flo?"</s> </p>

<p pid="463" id="girls.c0.p463"><s>"Yes, we're in agonies," answered Flo Dunstan, another second-class girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="464" id="girls.c0.p464"><s>"You will tell exactly what Mrs Willis said, darling heroine?" proceeded Annie in her most dulcet tones.</s> <s>"You concealed your knowledge, didn't you? you were very firm, weren't you? dear, brave love!"</s> </p>

<p pid="465" id="girls.c0.p465"><s>"For my part, I think Cecil Temple the soul of brave firmness," here interrupted Susan Drummond.</s> <s>"I fancy she's as hard and firm in herself when she wants to conceal a thing as that rocky sweetmeat which always hurts our teeth to get through.</s> <s>Yes, I do fancy that."</s> </p>

<p pid="466" id="girls.c0.p466"><s>"Oh, Susy, what a horrid metaphor!" here interrupted several girls.</s> </p>

<p pid="467" id="girls.c0.p467"><s>One, however, of the eager group of school-girls had not opened her lips or said a word; that girl was Hester Thornton.</s> <s>She had been drawn into the circle by an intense curiosity; but she had made no comment with regard to Cecil's conduct.</s> <s>If she knew anything of the mystery she had thrown no light on it.</s> <s>She had simply sat motionless, with watchful and alert eyes and silent tongue.</s> <s>Now, for the first time, she spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="468" id="girls.c0.p468"><s>"I think, if you will allow her, that Cecil has got something to say," she remarked.</s> </p>

<p pid="469" id="girls.c0.p469"><s>Cecil glanced down at her with a very brief look of gratitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="470" id="girls.c0.p470"><s>"Thank you, Hester," she said.</s> <s>"I won't keep you a moment, girls.</s> <s>I cannot offer to throw any light on the mystery which makes us all so miserable to-day; but I think it right to undeceive you with regard to myself.</s> <s>I have not concealed what I know from Mrs Willis.</s> <s>She is in possession of all the facts, and what I found in my desk this morning is now in her keeping.</s> <s>She has made me see that in concealing my knowledge I was acting wrongly, and whatever pain has come to me in the matter, she now knows all."</s> </p>

<p pid="471" id="girls.c0.p471" type="speech"><s>When Cecil had finished her sad little speech she walked straight out of the group of girls, and, without glancing at one of them, went across the play-room to her own compartment.</s> <s>She had failed to observe a quick and startled glance from Susan Drummond's sleepy blue eyes, nor had she heard her mutter--half to her companions, half to herself--<qs/>"Cecil is not like the rocky sweetmeat; I was mistaken in her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="472" id="girls.c0.p472"><s>Neither had Cecil seen the flash of almost triumph in Hester's eyes, nor the defiant glance she threw at Miss Forest.</s> <s>Annie stood with her hands clasped, and a little frown of perplexity between her brows, for a moment; then she ran fearlessly down the play-room, and said in a low voice at the other side of Cecil's curtains--</s> </p>

<p pid="473" id="girls.c0.p473"><s>"May I come in?"</s> </p>

<p pid="474" id="girls.c0.p474" type="speech"><s>Cecil said <qs/>"Yes,"<qe/> and Annie, entering the pretty little drawing-room, flung her arms round Miss Temple's neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="475" id="girls.c0.p475" type="speech"><s>"Cecil," she exclaimed impulsively, <qs/>"you're in great trouble.</s> <s>I am a giddy, reckless thing, I know, but I don't laugh at people when they are in real trouble.</s> <s>Won't you tell me all about it, Cecil?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="476" id="girls.c0.p476"><s>"I will, Annie.</s> <s>Sit down there and I will tell you everything.</s> <s>I think you have a right to know, and I am glad you have come to me.</s> <s>I thought, perhaps--but no matter.</s> <s>Annie, can't you guess what I am going to say?"</s> </p>

<p pid="477" id="girls.c0.p477"><s>"No, I'm sure I can't," said Annie.</s> <s>"I saw for a moment or two to-day that some of those absurd girls suspected me of being the author of all this mischief.</s> <s>Now, you know, Cecil, I love a bit of fun beyond words.</s> <s>If there's any going on I feel nearly mad until I am in it; but what was done to-day was not at all in accordance with my ideas of fun.</s> <s>To tear up Miss Russell's essay and fill her desk with stupid plum-cake and Turkish delight seems to me but a sorry kind of jest.</s> <s>Now, if I had been guilty of that sort of thing, I'd have managed something far cleverer than that.</s> <s>If _I_ had tampered with Dora Russell's desk, I'd have done the thing in style.</s> <s>The dear, sweet, dignified creature should have shrieked in real terror.</s> <s>You don't know perhaps, Cecil, that our admirable Dora is no end of a coward.</s> <s>I wonder what she would have said if I had put a little nest of field-mice in her desk.</s> <s>I saw that the poor thing suspected me, as she gave way to her usual little sneer about the `underbred girl:' but, of course, _you_ know me, Cecil.</s> <s>Why, my dear Cecil, what is the matter?</s> <s>How white you are, and you are actually crying!</s> <s>What is it, Cecil? what is it, Cecil, darling?"</s> </p>

<p pid="478" id="girls.c0.p478"><s>Cecil dried her eyes quickly.</s> </p>

<p pid="479" id="girls.c0.p479"><s>"You know my pet copy of Mrs Browning's poems, don't you, Annie?"</s> </p>

<p pid="480" id="girls.c0.p480"><s>"Oh, yes, of course.</s> <s>You lent it to me one day.</s> <s>Don't you remember how you made me cry over that picture of little Alice, the over-worked factory girl?</s> <s>What about the book, Cecil?"</s> </p>

<p pid="481" id="girls.c0.p481" type="speech"><s>"I found the book in my desk,<qs/>" said Cecil, in a steady tone, and now fixing her eyes on Annie, who knelt by her side--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>I found the book in my desk, although I never keep it there; for it is quite against the rules to keep our recreation books in our school-desks, and you know, Annie, I always think it is so much easier to keep these little rules.</s> <s>They are matters of duty and conscience after all.</s> <s>I found my copy of Mrs Browning in my desk this morning with the cover torn off, and with a very painful and ludicrous caricature of our dear Mrs Willis sketched on the title-page."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="482" id="girls.c0.p482"><s>"What?" said Annie.</s> <s>"No, no; impossible."</s> </p>

<p pid="483" id="girls.c0.p483"><s>"You know nothing about it do you, Annie?"</s> </p>

<p pid="484" id="girls.c0.p484"><s>"I never put it there, if that's what you mean," said Annie.</s> <s>But her face had undergone a curious change.</s> <s>Her light and easy and laughing manner had altered.</s> <s>When Cecil mentioned the caricature she flushed a vivid crimson.</s> <s>Her flush had quickly died away, leaving her olive-tinted face paler than its wont.</s> </p>

<p pid="485" id="girls.c0.p485" type="speech"><s>"I see," she said, after a long pause, <qs/>"you, too, suspected me, Cecil, and that is why you tried to conceal the thing.</s> <s>You know that I am the only girl in the school who can draw caricatures, but did you suppose that I would show _her_ dishonour?</s> <s>Of course things look ugly for me, if this is what you found in your book; but I did not think that _you_ would suspect me, Cecil."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="486" id="girls.c0.p486"><s>"I will believe you, Annie," said Cecil eagerly.</s> <s>"I long beyond words to believe you.</s> <s>With all your faults, no one has ever yet found you out in a lie.</s> <s>If you look at me, Annie, and tell me honestly that you know nothing whatever about that caricature, I will believe you.</s> <s>Yes, I will believe you fully, and I will go with you to Mrs Willis and tell her that, whoever did the wrong, you are innocent in this matter.</s> <s>Say you know nothing about it, dear, dear Annie, and take a load off my heart."</s> </p>

<p pid="487" id="girls.c0.p487"><s>"I never put the caricature into your book, Cecil."</s> </p>

<p pid="488" id="girls.c0.p488"><s>"And you know nothing about it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="489" id="girls.c0.p489"><s>"I cannot say that; I never--never put it in your book."</s> </p>

<p pid="490" id="girls.c0.p490"><s>"Oh, Annie, exclaimed poor Cecil, you are trying to deceive me.</s> <s>Why won't you be brave?</s> <s>Oh, Annie, I never thought you would stoop to a lie!"</s> </p>

<p pid="491" id="girls.c0.p491"><s>"I'm telling no lie," answered Annie with sudden passion.</s> <s>"I do know something about the caricature, but I never put it into that book.</s> <s>There! you doubt me, you have ceased to believe me, and I won't waste any more words on the matter."</s> </p>

<p pid="492" id="girls.c0.p492"><s>CHAPTER FOURTEEN.</s> <s>"SENT TO COVENTRY."</s> </p>

<p pid="493" id="girls.c0.p493"><s>There were many girls in the school who remembered that dismal half-holiday--they remembered its forced mirth and its hidden anxiety; and as the hours flew by the suspicion that Annie Forest was the author of all the mischief grew and deepened.</s> <s>A school is like a little world, and popular opinion is apt to change with great rapidity.</s> <s>Annie was undoubtedly the favourite of the school; but favourites are certain to have enemies, and there were several girls unworthy enough and mean enough to be jealous of poor Annie's popularity.</s> <s>She was the kind of girl whom only very small natures could really dislike.</s> <s>Her popularity arose from the simple fact that hers was a peculiarly joyous and unselfish nature.</s> <s>She was a girl with scarcely any self-consciousness; those she loved, she loved devotedly; she threw herself with a certain feverish impetuosity into their lives, and made their interests her own.</s> <s>To get into mischief and trouble for the sake of a friend was an every-day occurrence with Annie.</s> <s>She was not the least studious; she had no one particular talent, unless it was an untrained and birdlike voice; she was always more or less in hot water about her lessons, always behindhand in her tasks, always leaving undone what she should do, and doing what she should not do.</s> <s>She was a contradictory, erratic creature--jealous of no one, envious of no one--dearly loving a joke, and many times inflicting pain from sheer thoughtlessness, but always ready to say she was sorry, always ready to make friends again.</s> </p>

<p pid="494" id="girls.c0.p494"><s>It is strange that such a girl as Annie should have enemies, but she had, and in the last few weeks the feeling of jealousy and envy which had always been smouldering in some breasts took more active form.</s> <s>Two reasons accounted for this:</s> <s>Hester's openly avowed and persistent dislike to Annie, and Miss Russell's declared conviction that she was underbred and not a lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="495" id="girls.c0.p495"><s>Miss Russell was the only girl in the first-class who had hitherto given wild little Annie a thought.</s> </p>

<p pid="496" id="girls.c0.p496"><s>In the first-class, to-day, Annie had to act the unpleasing part of the wicked little heroine.</s> <s>Miss Russell was quite certain of Annie's guilt; she and her companions condescended to discuss poor Annie and to pull all her little virtues to pieces, and to magnify her sins to an alarming extent.</s> </p>

<p pid="497" id="girls.c0.p497" type="speech"><s>After two or three hours of judicious conversation, Dora Russell and most of the other first-class girls decided that Annie ought to be expelled, and unanimously resolved that they at least, would do what they could to <qs/>"send her to Coventry."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="498" id="girls.c0.p498"><s>In the lower part of the school Annie also had a few enemies, and these girls, having carefully observed Hester's attitude toward her, now came up close to this dignified little lady, and asked her boldly to declare her opinion with regard to Annie's guilt.</s> </p>

<p pid="499" id="girls.c0.p499" type="speech"><s>Hester, without the least hesitation, assured them that <qs/>"of course Annie had done it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="500" id="girls.c0.p500" type="speech"><s>"There is not room for a single doubt on the subject," she said; <qs/>"there--look at her now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="501" id="girls.c0.p501"><s>At this instant Annie was leaving Cecil's compartment, and with red eyes, and hair, as usual, falling about her face, was running out of the play-room.</s> <s>She seemed in great distress; but, nevertheless, before she reached the door, she stopped to pick up a little girl of five, who was fretting about some small annoyance.</s> <s>Annie took the little one in her arms, kissed her tenderly, whispered some words in her ear, which caused the little face to light up with some smiles and the round arms to clasp Annie with an ecstatic hug.</s> <s>She dropped the child, who ran back to play merrily with her companions, and left the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="502" id="girls.c0.p502"><s>The group of middle-class girls still sat on by the fire, but Hester Thornton now, not Annie, was the centre of attraction.</s> <s>It was the first time in all her young life that Hester had found herself in the enviable position of a favourite; and without at all knowing what mischief she was doing, she could not resist improving the occasion, and making the most of her dislike for Annie.</s> </p>

<p pid="503" id="girls.c0.p503" type="speech"><s>Several of those who even were fond of Miss Forest came round to the conviction that she was really guilty, and one by one, as is the fashion not only among school-girls but in the greater world outside, they began to pick holes in their former favourite.</s> <s>These girls, too, resolved that, if Annie were really so mean as maliciously to injure other girls' property and get them into trouble, she must be <qs/>"sent to Coventry."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="504" id="girls.c0.p504"><s>"What's Coventry?" asked one of the little ones, the child whom Annie had kissed and comforted, now sidling up to the group.</s> </p>

<p pid="505" id="girls.c0.p505"><s>"Oh, a nasty place, Phena," said Mary Bell, putting her arm round the pretty child and drawing her to her side.</s> </p>

<p pid="516" id="girls.c0.p516"><s>A few days after this Hester was much delighted to receive an invitation from her little friends, the Misses Bruce.</s> <s>These good ladies had not forgotten the lonely and miserable child whom they had comforted not a little during her journey to school six weeks ago.</s> <s>They invited Hester to spend the next half-holiday with them, and as this happened to fall on a Saturday, Mrs Willis gave Hester permission to remain with her friends until eight o'clock, when she would send the carriage to fetch her home.</s> </p>

<p pid="517" id="girls.c0.p517"><s>The trouble about Annie had taken place the Wednesday before, and all the girls' heads were full of the uncleared-up mystery when Hester started on her little expedition.</s> </p>

<p pid="518" id="girls.c0.p518"><s>Nothing was known; no fresh light had been thrown on the subject.</s> <s>Everything went on as usual within the school, and a casual observer would never have noticed the cloud which rested over that usually happy dwelling.</s> <s>A casual observer would have noticed little or no change in Annie Forest; her merry laugh was still heard, her light step still danced across the play-room floor, she was in her place in class, and was, if anything, a little more attentive and a little more successful over her lessons.</s> <s>Her pretty, piquant face, her arch expression, the bright, quick and droll glance which she alone could give, were still to be seen; but those who knew her well and those who loved her best saw a change in Annie.</s> </p>

<p pid="519" id="girls.c0.p519"><s>In the play-room she devoted herself exclusively to the little ones; she never went near Cecil Temple's drawing-room, she never mingled with the girls of the middle school as they clustered round the cheerful fire.</s> <s>At meal-times she ate little, and her room-fellow was heard to declare that she was awakened more than once in the middle of the night by the sound of Annie's sobs.</s> <s>In chapel, too, when she fancied herself quite unobserved, her face wore an expression of great pain; but if Mrs Willis happened to glance in her direction, instantly the little mouth became demure and almost hard, the dark eyelashes were lowered over the bright eyes, the whole expression of the face showed the extreme of indifference.</s> <s>Hester felt more sure than ever of Annie's guilt; but one or two of the other girls in the school wavered in this opinion, and would have taken Annie out of "Coventry" had she herself made the smallest advance toward them.</s> </p>

<p pid="520" id="girls.c0.p520" type="speech"><s>Annie and Hester had not spoken to each other now for several days; but on this afternoon, which was a bright one in early spring, as Hester was changing her school-dress for her Sunday one, and preparing for her visit to the Misses Bruce, there came a light knock at her door.</s> <s>She said <qs/>"Come in,"<qe/> rather impatiently, for she was in a hurry, and dreaded being kept.</s> </p>

<p pid="524" id="girls.c0.p524"><s>She was turning away when Hester compelled herself to remark--</s> </p>

<p pid="527" id="girls.c0.p527"><s>Hester would not allow herself, however, to feel any tenderness toward Annie.</s> <s>Of course she was not really a bit like sweet little Nan, and it was absurd to suppose that a great girl like Annie could want caressing and petting and soothing; still, in spite of herself, Annie's look haunted her, and she took great care of the little flower-offering, and presented it with Annie's message instantly on her arrival to the little old ladies.</s> </p>

<p pid="528" id="girls.c0.p528"><s>Miss Jane and Miss Agnes were very much pleased with the early primroses.</s> <s>They looked at one another and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="529" id="girls.c0.p529"><s>"Poor dear little girl," in tender voices, and then they put the flowers into one of their daintiest vases, and made much of them, and showed them to any visitors who happened to call that afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="530" id="girls.c0.p530"><s>Their little house looked something like a doll's house to Hester, who had been accustomed all her life to large rooms and spacious passages; but it was the sweetest, daintiest, and most charming little abode in the world.</s> <s>It was not unlike a nest, and the Misses Bruce in certain ways resembled bright little robin redbreasts, so small, so neat, so chirrupy they were.</s> </p>

<p pid="531" id="girls.c0.p531"><s>Hester enjoyed her afternoon immensely; the little ladies were right in their prophecy, and she was no longer lonely at school.</s> <s>She enjoyed talking about her school-fellows, about her new life, about her studies.</s> <s>The Misses Bruce were decidedly fond of a gossip, but something which she could not at all define in their manner prevented Hester from retailing for their benefit any unkind news.</s> <s>They told her frankly at last that they were only interested in the good things which went on in the school, and that they found no pursuit so altogether delightful as finding out the best points in all the people they came across.</s> <s>They would not even laugh at sleepy, tiresome Susan Drummond; on the contrary, they pitied her, and Miss Jane wondered if the girl could be quite well, whereupon Miss Agnes shook her head, and said emphatically that it was Hester's duty to rouse poor Susy, and to make her waking life so interesting to her that she should no longer care to spend so many hours in the world of dreams.</s> </p>

<p pid="532" id="girls.c0.p532"><s>There is such a thing as being so kind-hearted, so gentle, so charitable as to make the people who have not encouraged these virtues feel quite uncomfortable.</s> <s>By the mere force of contrast they begin to see themselves something as they really are.</s> <s>Since Hester had come to Lavender House she had taken very little pains to please others rather than herself, and she was now almost startled to see how she had allowed selfishness to get the better of her.</s> <s>While the Misses Bruce were speaking, old longings, which had slept since her mother's death, came back to the young girl, and she began to wish that she could be kinder to Susan Drummond, and that she could overcome her dislike to Annie Forest.</s> <s>She longed to say something about Annie to the little ladies, but they evidently did not wish to allude to the subject.</s> <s>When she was going away, they gave her a small parcel.</s> </p>

<p pid="533" id="girls.c0.p533"><s>"You will kindly give this to your schoolfellow, Miss Forest, Hester dear," they both said, and then they kissed her, and said they hoped they should see her again: and Hester got into the old-fashioned school brougham, and held the brown-paper parcel in her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="534" id="girls.c0.p534"><s>As she was going into the chapel that night, Mary Bell came up to her and whispered--</s> </p>

<p pid="535" id="girls.c0.p535"><s>"We have not got to the bottom of that mystery about Annie Forest yet.</s> <s>Mrs Willis can evidently make nothing of her, and I believe Mr Everard is going to talk to her after prayers to-night."</s> </p>

<p pid="536" id="girls.c0.p536"><s>As she was speaking, Annie herself pushed rather rudely past the two girls; her face was flushed, and her hair was even more untidy than was its wont.</s> </p>

<p pid="537" id="girls.c0.p537"><s>"Here is a parcel for you, Miss Forest," said Hester, in a much more gentle tone than she was wont to use when she addressed this objectionable school-mate.</s> </p>

<p pid="538" id="girls.c0.p538"><s>All the girls were now filing into the chapel, and Hester should certainly not have presented the little parcel at that moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="539" id="girls.c0.p539" type="speech"><s>"Breaking the rules, Miss Thornton," said Annie; <qs/>"all right, toss it here."<qe/></s> <s>Then, as Hester failed to comply, she ran back, knocking her school-fellows out of place, and, snatching the parcel from Hester's hand, threw it high in the air.</s> <s>This was a piece of not only wilful audacity and disobedience, but it even savoured of the profane, for Annie's step was on the threshold of the chapel, and the parcel fell with a noisy bang on the floor some feet inside the little building.</s> </p>

<p pid="540" id="girls.c0.p540"><s>"Bring me that parcel, Annie Forest," whispered the stern voice of the head-mistress.</s> </p>

<p pid="541" id="girls.c0.p541"><s>Annie sullenly complied; but when she came up to Mrs Willis, her governess took her hand, and pushed her down into a low seat a little behind her.</s> </p>

<p pid="543" id="girls.c0.p543"><s>The short evening service was over, and one by one, in orderly procession, the girls left the chapel.</s> <s>Annie was about to rise to her feet to follow her school-companions, when Mrs Willis stooped down and whispered something in her ear.</s> <s>Her face became instantly suffused with a dull red; she resumed her seat, and buried her face in both her hands.</s> <s>One or two of the girls noticed her despondent attitude as they left the chapel, and Cecil Temple looked back with a glance of such unutterable sympathy that Annie's proud, suffering little heart would have been touched could she but have seen the look.</s> </p>

<p pid="544" id="girls.c0.p544"><s>Presently the young steps died away, and Annie, raising her head, saw that she was alone with Mr Everard, who seated himself in the place which Mrs Willis had occupied by her side.</s> </p>

<p pid="545" id="girls.c0.p545" type="speech"><s>"Your governess has asked me to speak to you, my dear," he said, in his kind and fatherly tones; <qs/>"she wants us to discuss this thing which is making you so unhappy quite fully together."<qe/></s> <s>Here the clergyman paused, and, noticing a sudden wistful and soft look in the girl's brown eyes, he continued:</s> <s>"Perhaps, however, you have something to say to me which will throw light on this mystery?"</s> </p>

<p pid="546" id="girls.c0.p546"><s>"No, sir, I have nothing to say," replied Annie, and now again the sullen expression passed like a wave over her face.</s> </p>

<p pid="547" id="girls.c0.p547" type="speech"><s>"Poor child," said Mr Everard.</s> <s>"Perhaps, Annie," he continued, <qs/>"you do not quite understand me--you do not quite read my motive in talking to you to-night.</s> <s>I am not here in any sense to reprove you.</s> <s>You are either guilty of this sin, or you are not guilty.</s> <s>In either case I pity you; it is very hard, very bitter, to be falsely accused--I pity you much if this is the case; but it is still harder, Annie, still more bitter, still more absolutely crushing to be accused of a sin which we are trying to conceal.</s> <s>In that terrible case God Himself hides His face.</s> <s>Poor child, poor child, I pity you most of all if you are guilty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="548" id="girls.c0.p548"><s>Annie had again covered her face, and bowed her head over her hands.</s> <s>She did not speak for a moment, but presently Mr Everard heard a low sob, and then another, and another, until at last her whole frame was shaken with a perfect tempest of weeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="549" id="girls.c0.p549"><s>The old clergyman, who had seen many strange phases of human nature, who had in his day comforted and guided more than one young school-girl, was far too wise to do anything to check this flow of grief.</s> <s>He knew Annie would speak more fully and more frankly when her tears were over.</s> <s>He was right.</s> <s>She presently raised a very tear-stained face to the clergyman.</s> </p>

<p pid="550" id="girls.c0.p550"><s>"I felt very bitter at your coming to speak to me," she began.</s> <s>"Mrs Willis has always sent for you when everything else has failed with us girls, and I did not think she would treat me so.</s> <s>I was determined not to say anything to you.</s> <s>Now, however, you have spoken good words to me, and I can't turn away from you.</s> <s>I will tell you all that is in my heart.</s> <s>I will promise before God to conceal nothing, if only you will do one thing for me."</s> </p>

<p pid="551" id="girls.c0.p551"><s>"What is that, my child?"</s> </p>

<p pid="552" id="girls.c0.p552"><s>"Will you believe me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="554" id="girls.c0.p554"><s>"Ah, but you have not been tried yet.</s> <s>I thought Mrs Willis would certainly believe; but she said the circumstantial evidence was too strong--perhaps it will be too strong for you."</s> </p>

<p pid="555" id="girls.c0.p555"><s>"I promise to believe you, Annie Forest; if, before God, you can assure me that you are speaking the whole truth, I will fully believe you."</s> </p>

<p pid="556" id="girls.c0.p556"><s>Annie paused again, then she rose from her seat and stood a pace away from the old minister.</s> </p>

<p pid="557" id="girls.c0.p557"><s>"This is the truth before God," she said, as she locked her two hands together and raised her eyes freely and unshrinkingly to Mr Everard's face.</s> </p>

<p pid="559" id="girls.c0.p559"><s>Here Annie paused, she began to unclasp and clasp her hands, and she looked full at Mr Everard with a most pleading expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="560" id="girls.c0.p560"><s>"Do you mind repeating to me exactly what you said to your governess?" he questioned.</s> </p>

<p pid="561" id="girls.c0.p561"><s>"I said this, sir.</s> <s>I said, `Yes, Mrs Willis, I did draw that caricature.</s> <s>You will scarcely understand how I, who love you so much, could have been so mad and ungrateful as to do anything to turn you into ridicule.</s> <s>I would cut off my right hand now not to have done it; but I did do it, and I must tell you the truth.'</s> <s>`Tell me, dear,' she said, quite gently then.</s> <s>`It was one wet afternoon about a fortnight ago,' I said to her; `a lot of us middle-school-girls were sitting together, and I had a pencil and some bits of paper, and I was making up funny little groups of a lot of us, and the girls were screaming with laughter, for somehow I managed to make the likeness that I wanted in each case.'</s> <s>It was very wrong of me, I know.</s> <s>It was against the rules; but I was in one of my maddest humours, and I really do not care what the consequences were.</s> <s>At last one of the girls said:</s> <s>`You won't dare to make a picture like that of Mrs Willis, Annie--you know you won't dare.'</s> <s>The minute she said that name I began to feel ashamed.</s> <s>I remembered I was breaking one of the rules, and I suddenly tore up all my bits of paper and flung them into the fire, and I said, `No, I would not dare to show her dishonour.'</s> <s>Well, afterwards, as I was washing my hands for tea up in my room, the temptation came over me so strongly that I felt I could not resist it, to make a funny little sketch of Mrs Willis.</s> <s>I had a little scrap of thin paper, and I took out my pencil and did it all in a minute.</s> <s>It seemed to me very funny, and I could not help laughing at it; and then I thrust it into my private writing-case, which I always keep locked, and I put the key in my pocket and ran downstairs.</s> <s>I forgot all about the caricature.</s> <s>I had never shown it to anyone.</s> <s>How it got into Cecil's book is more than I can say.</s> <s>When I had finished speaking Mrs Willis looked very hard at the book.</s> <s>`You are right,' she said; `this caricature is drawn on a very thin piece of paper, which has been cleverly pasted on the title-page.'</s> <s>Then, Mr Everard, she asked me a lot of questions.</s> <s>Had I ever parted with my keys?</s> <s>Had I ever left my desk unlocked?</s> <s>`No,' I said, `my desk is always locked, and my keys are always in my pocket.</s> <s>Indeed,' I added, `my keys were absolutely safe for the last week, for they went in a white petticoat to the wash, and came back as rusty as possible.'</s> <s>I could not open my desk for a whole week, which was a great nuisance.</s> <s>I told all this story to Mrs Willis, and she said to me, `You are positively certain that this caricature has been taken out of your desk by somebody else, and pasted in here?</s> <s>You are sure that the caricature you drew is not to be found in your desk?'</s> <s>`Yes,' I said; `how can I be anything but sure; these are my pencil marks, and that is the funny little turn I gave to your neck which made me laugh when I drew it.</s> <s>Yes; I am certainly sure.'</s> </p>

<p pid="562" id="girls.c0.p562"><s>"`I have always been told, Annie,' Mrs Willis said, `that you are the only girl in the school who can draw these caricatures.</s> <s>You have never seen an attempt at this kind of drawing amongst your school-fellows, or amongst any of the teachers?'</s> </p>

<p pid="565" id="girls.c0.p565"><s>"`Yes,' I answered, pulling them all covered with rust out of my pocket.</s> </p>

<p pid="566" id="girls.c0.p566"><s>"Then she told me to leave the keys on the table, and to go upstairs and fetch down my little private desk.</s> </p>

<p pid="567" id="girls.c0.p567"><s>"I did so, and she made me put the rusty key in the lock and open the desk, and together we searched through its contents.</s> <s>We pulled out everything, or rather I did, and I scattered all my possessions about on the table, and then I looked up almost triumphantly at Mrs Willis.</s> </p>

<p pid="568" id="girls.c0.p568"><s>"`You see the caricature is not here,' I said, `somebody picked the lock and took it away.'</s> </p>

<p pid="569" id="girls.c0.p569"><s>"`This lock has not been picked,' Mrs Willis said, `and what is that little piece of white paper sticking out of the private drawer?'</s> </p>

<p pid="570" id="girls.c0.p570"><s>"`Oh, I forgot my private drawer,' I said; `but there is nothing in it-- nothing whatever,' and then I touched the spring, and pulled it open, and there lay the little caricature which I had drawn in the bottom of the drawer.</s> <s>There it lay, not as I had left it, for I had never put it into the private drawer.</s> <s>I saw Mrs Willis's face turn very white, and I noticed that her hands trembled.</s> <s>I was all red myself, and very hot, and there was a choking lump in my throat, and I could not have got a single word out even if I had wished to.</s> <s>So I began scrambling the things back into my desk, as hard as ever I could, and then I locked it, and put the rusty keys back in my pocket.</s> </p>

<p pid="606" id="girls.c0.p606"><s>Just at this time the weather suddenly changed.</s> <s>After the cold and dreariness of winter came soft spring days--came longer evenings and brighter mornings.</s> </p>

<p pid="607" id="girls.c0.p607"><s>Hester Thornton found that, she could dress by daylight, then that she was no longer cold and shivering when she reached the chapel, then that she began intensely to enjoy her mid-day walk, then that she found her winter things a little too hot, until at last, almost suddenly it seemed to the expectant and anxious girls, glorious spring weather broke upon the world, the winds were soft and westerly, the buds swelled and swelled into leaf on the trees, and the flowers bloomed in the delightful old-fashioned gardens of Lavender House.</s> <s>Instantly, it seemed to the girls, their whole lives had altered.</s> <s>The play-room was deserted or only put up with on wet days.</s> <s>At twelve o'clock, instead of taking a monotonous walk on the roads, they ran races, played tennis, croquet, or any other game they liked best in the gardens.</s> <s>Later on in the day, when the sun was not so powerful, they took their walk; but even then they had time to rush back to their beloved shady garden for a little time before tea and preparation for their next day's work.</s> <s>Easter came this year about the middle of April, and Easter found these girls almost enjoying summer weather.</s> <s>How they looked forward to their few Easter holidays! what plans they made, what tennis matches were arranged, what games and amusements of all sorts were in anticipation!</s> <s>Mrs Willis herself generally went away for a few days at Easter; so did the French governess, and the school was nominally placed under the charge of Miss Good and Miss Danesbury.</s> <s>Mrs Willis did not approve of long Easter holidays; she never gave more than a week, and in consequence only the girls who lived quite near went home.</s> <s>Out of the fifty girls who resided at Lavender House about ten went away at Easter; the remaining forty stayed behind, and were often heard to declare that holidays at Lavender House were the most delightful things in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="608" id="girls.c0.p608"><s>At this particular Easter time the girls were rather surprised to near that Mrs Willis had made up her mind not to go away as usual; Miss Good was to have a holiday, and Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury were to look after the school.</s> <s>This was felt to be an unusual, indeed unheard-of, proceeding, and the girls commented about it a good deal, and somehow, without absolutely intending to do so, they began to settle in their own minds that Mrs Willis was staying in the school on account of Annie Forest, and that in her heart of hearts she did not absolutely believe in her innocence.</s> <s>Mrs Willis certainly gave the girls no reason to come to this conclusion; she was consistently kind to Annie, and had apparently quite restored her to her old place in her favour.</s> <s>Annie was more gentle than of old, and less inclined to get into scrapes; but the girls loved her far less in her present unnatural condition of reserve and good behaviour than they did in her old daring and hoydenish days.</s> <s>Cecil Temple always spent Easter with an old aunt who lived in a neighbouring town; she openly said this year that she did not wish to go away, but her governess would not allow her to change her usual plans, and she left Lavender House with a curious feeling of depression and coming trouble.</s> <s>As she was getting into the cab which was to take her to the station Annie flew to her side, threw a great bouquet of flowers which she had gathered into her lap, and, flinging her arms tightly round her neck, whispered suddenly and passionately:</s> </p>

<p pid="609" id="girls.c0.p609"><s>"Oh, Cecil, believe in me."</s> </p>

<p pid="610" id="girls.c0.p610"><s>"I--I--I don't know that I don't," said Cecil, rather lamely.</s> </p>

<p pid="611" id="girls.c0.p611"><s>"No, Cecil, you don't--not in your heart of hearts.</s> <s>Neither you nor Mrs Willis--you neither of you believe in me from the very bottom of your hearts; oh, it is hard!"</s> </p>

<p pid="612" id="girls.c0.p612"><s>Annie gave vent to a little sob, sprang away from Cecil's arms, and disappeared into a shrubbery close by.</s> </p>

<p pid="613" id="girls.c0.p613"><s>She stayed there until the sound of the retreating cab died away in the avenue, then, tossing back her hair, rearranging her rather tattered garden hat, and hastily wiping some tears from her eyes, she came out from her retreat, and began to look around her for some amusement.</s> <s>What should she do?</s> <s>Where should she go?</s> <s>How should she occupy herself?</s> <s>Sounds of laughter and merriment filled the air; the garden was all alive with gay young figures running here and there.</s> <s>Girls stood in groups under the horse chestnut tree--girls walked two and two up the shady walk at the end of the garden--little ones gambolled and rolled on the grass--a tennis match was going on vigorously, and the croquet ground was occupied by eight girls of the middle school.</s> <s>Annie was one of the most successful tennis players in the school; she had indeed a gift for all games of skill, and seldom missed her mark.</s> <s>Now she looked with a certain wistful longing toward the tennis-court; but, after a brief hesitation, she turned away from it and entered the shady walk at the farther end of the garden.</s> <s>As she walked along, slowly, meditatively, and sadly, her eyes suddenly lighted up.</s> <s>Glancing to one of the tall trees she saw a hammock suspended there which had evidently been forgotten during the winter.</s> <s>The tree was not yet quite in leaf, and it was very easy for Annie to climb up its branches, to readjust the hammock, and to get into it.</s> <s>After its winter residence in the tree this soft couch was found full of withered leaves, and otherwise rather damp and uncomfortable.</s> <s>Annie tossed the leaves on to the ground, and laughed as she swung herself gently backwards and forwards.</s> <s>Early as the season still was the sun was so bright and the air so soft that she could not but enjoy herself, and she laughed with pleasure, and only wished that she had a fairy tale by her side to help to soothe her off to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="614" id="girls.c0.p614" type="speech"><s>In the distance she heard some children calling <qs/>"Annie,"<qe/> <alt-qs/>"Annie Forest;"<alt-qe/> but she was far too comfortable and too lazy to answer them, and presently she closed her eyes and really did fall asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="616" id="girls.c0.p616" type="speech"><s>"I never liked her,<qs/>" said Hester--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>I never even from the very first pretended to like her.</s> <s>I think she is underbred, and not fit to associate with the other girls in the school-room."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="617" id="girls.c0.p617"><s>"She is treated with most unfair partiality," retorted Miss Russell in her thin and rather bitter voice.</s> <s>"I have not the smallest doubt, not the smallest, that she was guilty of putting those messes into my desk, of destroying my composition, and of caricaturing Mrs Willis in Cecil Temple's book.</s> <s>I wonder after that Mrs Willis did not see through her, but it is astonishing to what lengths favouritism will carry one.</s> <s>Mrs Willis and Mr Everard are behaving in a very unfair way to the rest of us in upholding this commonplace, disagreeable girl; but it will be to Mrs Willis's own disadvantage.</s> <s>Hester, I am, as you know, leaving school at Midsummer, and I shall certainly use all my influence to induce my father and mother not to send the younger girls here; they could not associate with a person like Miss Forest."</s> </p>

<p pid="618" id="girls.c0.p618" type="speech"><s>"I never take much notice of her," said Hester; <qs/>"but of course what you say is quite right, Dora.</s> <s>You have great discrimination, and your sisters might possibly be taken in by her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="620" id="girls.c0.p620"><s>"Mrs Willis is very nice herself, and so are most of the girls," said Hester, after a pause.</s> <s>Then they were both silent, for Hester had stooped down to examine some little fronds and moss which grew at the foot of the tree.</s> <s>After a pause, Hester said--</s> </p>

<p pid="623" id="girls.c0.p623"><s>The two girls walked slowly away, and presently Annie let herself gently out of her hammock and dropped to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="624" id="girls.c0.p624"><s>She had heard every word; she had not revealed herself, and a new and terrible--and, truth to say, absolutely foreign--sensation from her true nature now filled her mind.</s> <s>She felt that she almost hated those two who had spoken so cruelly, so unjustly of her.</s> <s>She began to trace her misfortunes and her unhappiness to the date of Hester's entrance into the school.</s> <s>Even more than Dora Russell did she dislike Hester; she made up her mind to revenge herself on both these girls.</s> <s>Her heart was very, very sore; she missed the old words, the old love, the old brightness, the old popularity; she missed the mother-tones in Mrs Willis's voice--her heart cried out for them, at night she often wept for them.</s> <s>She became more and more sure that she owed all her misfortunes to Hester, and in a smaller degree to Dora.</s> <s>Dora believed that she had deliberately insulted her, and injured her composition, when she knew herself that she was quite innocent of even harbouring such a thought, far less carrying it into effect.</s> <s>Well, now, she would really do something to injure both these girls, and perhaps the carrying out of her revenge would satisfy her sore heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="626" id="girls.c0.p626"><s>Just toward the end of the Easter holidays, Hester Thornton was thrown into a great tumult of excitement, of wonder, of half regret and half joy, by a letter which she received from her father.</s> <s>In this letter he informed her that he had made up his mind to break up his establishment for several years, to go abroad, and to leave Hester altogether under Mrs Willis's care.</s> </p>

<p pid="627" id="girls.c0.p627"><s>When Hester had read so far, she flung her letter on the table, put her head into her hands, and burst into tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="629" id="girls.c0.p629"><s>Hester cried bitterly; the strongest love of her nature was now given to this pretty and sweet little sister, and dismal pictures rose rapidly before her of Nan growing up without in the least remembering her-- perhaps, still worse, of Nan being unkindly treated and neglected by strangers.</s> <s>After a long pause, she raised her head, wiped her eyes, and resumed her letter.</s> <s>Now, indeed, she started with astonishment, and gave an exclamation of delight--Sir John Thornton had arranged that Mrs Willis was also to receive little Nan, although she was younger than any other child present in the school.</s> <s>Hester scarcely waited to finish her letter.</s> <s>She crammed it into her pocket, rushed up to Susan Drummond, and astonished that placid young lady by suddenly kissing her.</s> </p>

<p pid="631" id="girls.c0.p631"><s>She was far too impatient to explain matters to stolid Susan, and danced downstairs, her eyes sparkling and smiles on her lips.</s> <s>It was nothing to her now how long she stayed at school--her heart's treasure would be with her there, and she could not but feel happy.</s> </p>

<p pid="632" id="girls.c0.p632"><s>After breakfast Mrs Willis sent for her, and told her what arrangements were being made; she said that she was going to remove Susan Drummond out of Hester's bedroom, in order that Hester might enjoy her little sister's company at night.</s> <s>She spoke very gently, and entered with full sympathy into the girl's delight over the little motherless sister, and Hester felt more drawn to her governess than she had ever been.</s> </p>

<p pid="633" id="girls.c0.p633"><s>Nan was to arrive at Lavender House on the following evening, and for the first week her nurse was to remain with her until she got accustomed to her new life.</s> </p>

<p pid="636" id="girls.c0.p636"><s>But it was not hard this morning--all that was sweetest, and softest, and best in her had come to the surface--the little sister, whom her mother had left in her charge, was now to be her daily and hourly companion.</s> <s>For Nan's sake, then, she must be very good; her deeds must be gentle and kind, and her thoughts charitable.</s> <s>Hester had an instinctive feeling that baby eyes saw deep below the surface; Hester felt if Nan were to lose even a shadow of her faith in her she could almost die of shame.</s> </p>

<p pid="637" id="girls.c0.p637"><s>Hester had been very proud of Dora Russell's friendship.</s> <s>Never before had it been known in the school that a first-class girl took a third into such close companionship, and Hester's little head had been slightly turned by the fact.</s> <s>Her better judgment and her better nature had been rather blinded by the fascinations of this tall, graceful, satirical Dora.</s> <s>She had been weak enough to agree with Dora with her lips when in her heart of hearts she knew she was all wrong.</s> <s>By nature Hester was an honourable girl, with many fine traits in her character-- by nature Dora was small and mean and poor of soul.</s> </p>

<p pid="661" id="girls.c0.p661"><s>Annie raised her eyes to Hester's.</s> <s>She did not really want to be unkind, and at that moment it had certainly never entered into her head to steal Hester's treasure from her, but she could not help a look of suppressed delight and triumph filling her eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="662" id="girls.c0.p662"><s>Hester could scarcely bear the look; she stooped down, and taking one of Nan's little dimpled hands tried to drag her away.</s> </p>

<p pid="663" id="girls.c0.p663"><s>Instantly Annie threw the cup and ball on the floor.</s> </p>

<p pid="664" id="girls.c0.p664" type="speech"><s>"The play is all over to-night, little darling," she said; <qs/>"give Annie Forest one kiss, and run to bed with sister Hester."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="668" id="girls.c0.p668"><s>CHAPTER TWENTY.</s> <s>IN THE SOUTH PARLOUR.</s> </p>

<p pid="669" id="girls.c0.p669"><s>Immediately after Easter the real excitement of the school-year began.</s> <s>All the girls who had ambition, who had industry, and who had a desire to please distant fathers, mothers, or guardians, worked hard for that great day at Midsummer when Mrs Willis distributed her valuable prizes.</s> </p>

<p pid="670" id="girls.c0.p670"><s>From the moment of Hester's entrance into the school she had heard this day spoken of.</s> <s>It was, without doubt, the greatest day of the year at Lavender House.</s> <s>Smaller prizes were given at Christmas, but the great honours were always reserved for this long sunshiny June day, when Mrs Willis herself presented her marks of approbation to her successful pupils.</s> </p>

<p pid="671" id="girls.c0.p671"><s>The girls who had lived in the school for two or three years gave Hester vivid descriptions of the excitements, the pleasures, the delights of this day of days.</s> <s>In the first place, it was the first of the holidays, in the second it was spent almost from morning to night in the open air--for a great tent was erected on the lawn; and visitors thronged to Lavender House, and fathers and mothers, and aunts and uncles, arrived from a distance to witness the triumphs of the favoured children who had won the prizes.</s> <s>The giving away of the prizes was, of course, _the_ event of the day; but there were many other minor joys.</s> <s>Always in the evenings there was some special entertainment.</s> <s>These entertainments differed from year to year, Mrs Willis allowing the girls to choose them for themselves, and only making one proviso, that they must take all the trouble, and all the pains--in short, that they themselves must be the entertainers.</s> <s>One year they had tableaux vivants; another a fancy ball, every pretty dress of which had been designed by themselves, and many even made by their own industrious little fingers.</s> <s>Mrs Willis delighted in the interest and occupation that this yearly entertainment gave to her pupils, and she not only, encouraged them in their efforts to produce something very unique and charming, but took care that they should have sufficient time to work up their ideas properly.</s> <s>Always after Easter she gave the girls of the three first classes two evenings absolutely to themselves; and these they spent in a pretty room called the South Parlour, which belonged to Mrs Willis's part of the house, and was rarely used, except for these great preparations.</s> </p>

<p pid="672" id="girls.c0.p672"><s>Hester, therefore, after Easter found her days very full indeed.</s> <s>Every spare moment she devoted to little Nan, but she was quite determined to win a substantial prize, and she was also deeply interested in various schemes proposed in the South Parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="673" id="girls.c0.p673"><s>With regard to prizes, Mrs Willis also went on a plan of her own.</s> <s>Each girl was expected to come up to a certain standard of excellence in all her studies, and if she fell very much below this standard she was not allowed to try for any prize; if she came up to it, she could select one subject, but only one, for competition.</s> </p>

<p pid="674" id="girls.c0.p674"><s>On the Monday after the Easter holidays the special subjects for the Midsummer prizes were given out, and the girls were expected to send in their answers as to the special prize they meant to compete for by the following Friday.</s> </p>

<p pid="675" id="girls.c0.p675"><s>When this day arrived Hester Thornton and Dora Russell both discovered that they had made the same choice--they were going to try for the English composition prize.</s> <s>This subject always obtained one of the most costly prizes, and several of the girls shook their heads over Hester's choice.</s> </p>

<p pid="676" id="girls.c0.p676" type="speech"><s>"You are very silly to try for that, Hetty," they exclaimed, <qs/>"for Mrs Willis has such queer ideas with regard to English composition.</s> <s>Of course, we go in for it in a general way, and learn the rules of grammar and punctuation, and so forth, but Mrs Willis says that school-girls' themes are so bad and affected, as a rule, and she says she does not think anyone will go in for her pet prize who has not natural ability.</s> <s>In consequence, she gives only one prize for composition between the three first classes.</s> <s>You had better change your mind, Hetty, before it is too late, for much older girls will compete with you, and there are several who are going to try."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="677" id="girls.c0.p677"><s>Hester, however, only smiled, and assured her eager friend that she would stick to her pet subject, and try to do the best she could.</s> </p>

<p pid="678" id="girls.c0.p678"><s>On the morning when the girls signified their choice of subject, Mrs Willis came into the school-room and made one of her little yearly speeches with regard to the right spirit in which her girls should try for these honours.</s> <s>The few and well-chosen words of the head-mistress generally roused those girls who loved her best to a fever of enthusiasm, and even Hester, who was comparatively a newcomer, felt a great wish, as she listened to that clear and vibrating voice and watched the many expressions which passed over the noble face, that she might find something beyond the mere earthly honour and glory of success in this coming trial.</s> <s>Having finished her little speech, Mrs Willis made several remarks with regard to the choice of subjects.</s> <s>She spoke of the English composition prize last, and here she heightened the interest and excitement which always hung around this special prize.</s> <s>Contrary to her usual rule, she would this year give no subject for an English theme.</s> <s>Each girl might choose what pleased her best.</s> </p>

<p pid="679" id="girls.c0.p679"><s>On nearing these words Annie Forest, who had been sitting by her desk looking rather dull and dejected, suddenly sprang to her feet, her face aglow, her eyes sparkling, and began whispering vigorously to Miss Good.</s> </p>

<p pid="680" id="girls.c0.p680"><s>Miss Good nodded, and, going up to Mrs Willis, said aloud that Annie had changed her mind, and that from not wishing to try for any of the prizes, she now intended to compete for the English composition.</s> </p>

<p pid="681" id="girls.c0.p681"><s>Mrs Willis looked a little surprised, but without any comment she immediately entered Annie's name in the list of competitors, and Annie sat down again, not even glancing at her astonished school-fellows, who could not conceal their amazement, for she had never hitherto shown the slightest desire to excel in this department.</s> </p>

<p pid="682" id="girls.c0.p682"><s>On the evening of this Friday the girls of the three first classes assembled for the first time in the South Parlour.</s> <s>Hitherto these meetings had been carried on in a systematic and business-like fashion.</s> <s>It was impossible for all the girls who belonged to these three large classes to assemble on each occasion.</s> <s>Careful selections, therefore, were, as a rule, made from their numbers.</s> <s>These girls formed a committee to superintend and carry on the real preparations for the coming treat, and the others only met when specially summoned by the committee to appear.</s> </p>

<p pid="683" id="girls.c0.p683"><s>As usual now the three classes found themselves in the South Parlour--as usual they chattered volubly, and started schemes, to reject them again with peals of laughter.</s> <s>Many ideas were put forward, to be cast aside as utterly worthless.</s> <s>No one seemed to have any very brilliant thought, and as the first step on these occasions was to select what the entertainment should be, proceedings seemed to come to a standstill.</s> </p>

<p pid="684" id="girls.c0.p684"><s>The fact was the most daring originator, the one whoso ideas were always flavoured with a spice of novelty, was absolutely silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="685" id="girls.c0.p685"><s>Cecil Temple, who had taken a seat near Annie, suddenly, bent forward and spoke to her aloud.</s> </p>

<p pid="686" id="girls.c0.p686" type="speech"><s>"We have all said what we would like, and we none of us appear to have thought of anything at all worth having," she said; <qs/>"but you have not spoken at all, Annie.</s> <s>Give us an idea, dear--you know you originated the fancy ball last year."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="687" id="girls.c0.p687"><s>Thus publicly appealed to, Annie raised her full brown eyes, glanced at her companions, not one of whom, with the exception of Cecil, returned her gaze fully; then, rising to her feet, she spoke in a slightly contemptuous tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="688" id="girls.c0.p688"><s>"These preparations seem to me to be much ado about nothing; they lake up a lot of our time, and the results aren't worth the trouble--I have nothing particular to say.</s> <s>Oh, well, yes, if you like--let's have blind man's buff and a magic lantern;" and then, dropping a mock curtsey to her companions, she dashed out of the South Parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="689" id="girls.c0.p689" type="speech"><s>"Insufferable girl!" said Dora Russell; <qs/>"I wonder you try to draw her out, Cecil.</s> <s>You know perfectly that we none of us care to have anything to do with her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="690" id="girls.c0.p690"><s>"I know perfectly that you are all doing your best to make her life miserable," said Cecil, suddenly and boldly.</s> <s>"No one in this school has obeyed Mrs Willis's command to treat Annie as innocent--you are practically sending her to Coventry, and I think it is unjust and unfair.</s> <s>You don't know, girls, that you are ruining poor Annie's happiness."</s> </p>

<p pid="691" id="girls.c0.p691"><s>"Oh, dear! she doesn't seem at all dull," said Miss West, a second-class girl.</s> <s>"I do think she's a hardened little wretch."</s> </p>

<p pid="692" id="girls.c0.p692" type="speech"><s>"Little you know about her," said Cecil, the colour fading out of her pale face.</s> <s>Then, after a pause, she added, <qs/>"The injustice of the whole thing is that in this treatment of Annie you break the spirit of Mrs Willis's command--you, none of you, certainly tell her that she is guilty, but you treat her as such."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="693" id="girls.c0.p693"><s>Here Hester Thornton said a daring thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="694" id="girls.c0.p694"><s>"I don't believe Mrs Willis in her heart of hearts considers Annie guiltless."</s> </p>

<p pid="695" id="girls.c0.p695"><s>These words of Hester's were laughed at by most of the girls, but Dora Russell gave her an approving nod, and Cecil, looking paler than ever, dropped suddenly into her seat, and no longer tried to defend her absent friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="696" id="girls.c0.p696"><s>"At any rate," said Miss Conway, who as the head girl of the whole school was always listened to with great respect.</s> <s>"It is unfortunate for the success of our entertainment that there should be all this discussion and bad feeling with regard to Miss Forest.</s> <s>For my own part, I cannot make out why the poor little creature should be hunted down, or what affair it is of ours whether she is innocent or not.</s> <s>If Mr Everard and Mrs Willis says she is innocent, is not that enough?</s> <s>The fact of her guilt or innocence can't hurt us one way or another.</s> <s>It is a great pity, however, for our own sakes, that we should be out with her now, for, whatever her faults, she is the only one of us who is ever gifted with an original thought.</s> <s>But, as we can't have her, let us set to work without her--we really can't waste the whole evening over this sort of talk."</s> </p>

<p pid="697" id="girls.c0.p697"><s>Discussions as to the coming pleasure were now again resumed with vigour, and after a great deal of animated arguing it was resolved that two short plays should be acted; that a committee should be immediately formed, who should select the plays, and apportion their various parts to the different actors.</s> </p>

<p pid="698" id="girls.c0.p698"><s>The committee selected included Miss Russell, Miss Conway, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and two other girls of the second-class.</s> <s>The conference then broke up, but there was a certain sense of flatness over everything, and Cecil was not the only girl who sighed for the merry meetings of last year--when Annie had been the life and soul of all the proceedings, and when one brilliant idea after another with regard to the costumes for the fancy ball had dropped from her merry tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="699" id="girls.c0.p699"><s>CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.</s> <s>STEALING HEARTS.</s> </p>

<p pid="700" id="girls.c0.p700"><s>When Annie ran out of the South Parlour she found herself suddenly face to face with Mrs Willis.</s> </p>

<p pid="701" id="girls.c0.p701" type="speech"><s>"Well, my dear child," said the head-mistress in her kindest voice, <qs/>"where are you running to?</s> <s>But I suppose I must not ask; you are, of course, one of the busy and secret conclave in the South Parlour?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="702" id="girls.c0.p702"><s>"No.  I have left them," said Annie, bending her head, and after her usual habit when agitated, shaking her hair about her face.</s> </p>

<p pid="703" id="girls.c0.p703" type="speech"><s>"Left them?" repeated Mrs Willis, <qs/>"you mean, dear, that they have sent you for some message."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="704" id="girls.c0.p704"><s>"No.  I am not one of them.</s> <s>May I go into the garden, Mrs Willis?"</s> </p>

<p pid="705" id="girls.c0.p705"><s>"Certainly, my dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="706" id="girls.c0.p706"><s>Annie did not even glance at her governess.</s> <s>She pushed aside the baize door, and found herself in the great stone hall which led to the play-room and school-room.</s> <s>Her garden hat hung on a peg in the hall, and she tossed it off its place, and holding it in her hand ran toward the side door which opened directly into the garden.</s> <s>She had a wild wish to get to the shelter of the forsaken hammock and there cry out her whole heart.</s> <s>The moment she got into the open air, however, she was met by a whole troop of the little children, who were coming in after their usual short exercise before going to bed.</s> <s>Miss Danesbury was with them, and when Annie ran out by the open door, she entered holding two little ones by the hands.</s> <s>Last in this group toddled Hester's little sister Nan.</s> <s>The moment she saw Annie her little face broke into smiles; she held out two hands eagerly, and fled to the young girl's side.</s> </p>

<p pid="707" id="girls.c0.p707" type="speech"><s>"Where dat pitty toy?" she said, raising her round face to Annie's; <qs/>"some one did buy dat toy, and it's vedy pitty, and me wants it--where's dat toy?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="708" id="girls.c0.p708"><s>Annie stooped down, and spoke suddenly and impulsively to the little child.</s> </p>

<p pid="709" id="girls.c0.p709"><s>"You shall have the toy for your very own, Nan, if you will do something for me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="710" id="girls.c0.p710"><s>Nan's baby eyes looked straight into Annie's.</s> </p>

<p pid="711" id="girls.c0.p711" type="speech"><s>"Me will," she said emphatically; <qs/>"me want dat toy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="712" id="girls.c0.p712"><s>"Put your arms round me, little darling, and give me a great, tight hug."</s> </p>

<p pid="713" id="girls.c0.p713"><s>This request was great fun to Nan, who squeezed her little arms round Annie's neck, and pressed her dimpled cheek to her lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="714" id="girls.c0.p714" type="speech"><s>"Dere," she said triumphantly, <qs/>"will dat do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="715" id="girls.c0.p715"><s>"Yes, you little treasure, and you'll try to love me, won't you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="716" id="girls.c0.p716"><s>"Me do," said Nan, in a solemn voice; but then Miss Danesbury called her, and she ran into the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="717" id="girls.c0.p717"><s>As Nan trotted into the house she put up her dimpled hand to wipe something from her round cheek--it was a tear which Annie Forest had left there.</s> </p>

<p pid="718" id="girls.c0.p718"><s>Annie herself, when all the little ones had disappeared, walked slowly and sadly down toward the shady walk.</s> <s>The sun had just set, and though it was now nearly May, and the evenings long, the wind was sufficiently cold to cause Annie to shiver in her thin house frock.</s> <s>At all times utterly fearless with regard to her health, she gave it no thought now, but entering the walk where she knew she should not be disturbed, she looked up at the hammock, and wondered whether she should climb into it.</s> <s>She decided, however, not to do so--the great and terrible weight of tears which had pressed close to her heart were relieved by Nan's embrace; she no longer cared to cry until she could cry no longer--the worst of her pain had been soothed by the sweet baby graciousness of the little one.</s> </p>

<p pid="719" id="girls.c0.p719"><s>Then there darted into poor Annie's sore heart and perplexed brain that dangerous thought and temptation which was to work so much future pain and trouble.</s> <s>She already loved little Nan, and Nan, as most children did, had taken a fancy to her.</s> <s>Annie stood still, and clasped her hands as the dark idea came to her to steal the heart of little Nan from Hester, and so revenge herself on her.</s> <s>By doing this she would touch Hester in her most vulnerable point--she would take from her what she valued most.</s> <s>The temptation came swiftly, and Annie listened to it, and thought how easy it would be to carry it into effect.</s> <s>She knew well that no little child could resist her when she chose to exercise her charms--it would be easy, easy work to make that part of Nan which was most precious all her own.</s> <s>Annie became fascinated by the idea; how completely then she would have revenged all her wrongs on Hester!</s> <s>Some day Hester would bitterly repent of her unjust prejudice toward her; some day Hester would come to her, and beg of her in agony to give her back her darling's love; ah! when that day came it would be her turn to triumph.</s> </p>

<p pid="720" id="girls.c0.p720"><s>She felt more than satisfied as the temptation grew upon her; she shut out persistently from her view all the other side of the picture; she would not let herself think that the work she was about to undertake was cruel and mean.</s> <s>Hester had been more than unjust, and she was going to punish her.</s> </p>

<p pid="721" id="girls.c0.p721"><s>Annie paced faster and faster up and down the shady walk, and whenever her resolution wavered, the memory of Hester's face as she had seen it the same night in the South Parlour came visibly back and strengthened it.</s> <s>Yes, her turn had come at last.</s> <s>Hester had contrived since her entrance into the school to make Annie's life thoroughly miserable.</s> <s>Well, never mind, it was Annie's turn now to make her wretched.</s> </p>

<p pid="722" id="girls.c0.p722"><s>CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.</s> <s>IN BURN CASTLE WOOD.</s> </p>

<p pid="723" id="girls.c0.p723"><s>In concentrating her thoughts of revenge on Hester Annie ceased to trouble her head about Dora Russell.</s> <s>She considered Hester a crueller enemy than Dora.</s> <s>Hester belonged to her own set, worked in her own class, and would naturally, had things not turned out so unjustly, so unfairly, have been her friend, and not her enemy.</s> <s>Dora had nothing to say to Annie, and before Hester's advent into the school had scarcely noticed her existence.</s> <s>Annie therefore concentrated all her powers on punishing Hester.</s> <s>This gave her an aim and an occupation, and at first she felt that her revenge might give her real pleasure.</s> </p>

<p pid="724" id="girls.c0.p724"><s>Susan Drummond now shared Annie's bedroom, and Annie was rather startled one evening to hear this phlegmatic young person burst out into a strong tirade against Hester and Dora.</s> <s>Dora had managed, for some inexplicable reason, to offend Susan, and Susan now looked to Annie for sympathy, and boldly suggested that they should get up what she was pleased to call "a lark" between them for the punishment of this very dignified young lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="725" id="girls.c0.p725"><s>Annie had never liked Susan, and she now stared at her, and said in her quick way--</s> </p>

<p pid="726" id="girls.c0.p726"><s>"You won't catch me helping you in any of your larks.</s> <s>I've had trouble enough on that score as it is."</s> </p>

<p pid="727" id="girls.c0.p727"><s>Susan gazed at her stupidly, and a dull read spread over her face.</s> </p>

<p pid="728" id="girls.c0.p728" type="speech"><s>"But I thought you hated Dora and Hester,<qs/>" she said--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>I'm sure they hate you."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="729" id="girls.c0.p729"><s>Annie was silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="730" id="girls.c0.p730"><s>"You do hate them, don't you?" persisted Miss Drummond.</s> </p>

<p pid="731" id="girls.c0.p731"><s>"It's nothing to you what I feel toward them, Susy," said Annie.</s> <s>"Please don't disturb me with any more of your chatter; I am very sleepy, and you are keeping me awake."</s> <s>Thus silenced, Susan had to content herself by turning on her back, and going into the land of dreams; but she was evidently a good deal surprised and disappointed, and began to entertain a certain respect, and even fear, of Annie, which had been hitherto unknown to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="732" id="girls.c0.p732"><s>Meanwhile Hester was very busy, very happy, and more satisfied--brighter and better employed than she had ever been in her life before.</s> <s>Nan's love satisfied the affectionate side of her nature, and all her intellect was strained to the utmost to win honours in the coming struggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="733" id="girls.c0.p733"><s>She had stuck firmly to her resolve to work for the English composition prize, and she firmly made up her own mind to leave no stone unturned to win it.</s> <s>What affection she, possessed for Miss Russell was not at all of a character to prevent her from thoroughly enjoying taking the prize out of her hands.</s> <s>Her love for Dora had been fed by vanity, and was not at all of a deep or noble character.</s> <s>She was some time carefully choosing the subject of her theme, and at last she resolved to write a brief historical description of the last days of Marie Antoinette.</s> <s>To write properly on this subject she had to read up a great deal, and had to find references in books which were not usually allowed as school-room property.</s> <s>Mrs Willis, however, always allowed the girls who were working for the English composition prize to have access to her rather extensive library, and here Hester was often to be found during play-hours.</s> <s>Two evenings in the week were also taken up in preparation for the coming plays, and as Hester was to take rather an important part in one, and a small character in another, she was obliged to devote herself to getting up her parts during the weekly half-holidays.</s> <s>Thus every moment was busy, and, except at night, she had little time to devote herself to Nan.</s> </p>

<p pid="734" id="girls.c0.p734"><s>Nan slept in a pretty crib in Hester's room, and each evening the young girl knelt down by her sister's side, and gazed at her with love which was almost motherly swelling in her breast.</s> </p>

<p pid="735" id="girls.c0.p735"><s>All that was best of Hester was drawn out at these moments; something greater than ambition--something far and away above school triumphs and school jealousies spoke then in her heart of hearts.</s> <s>These moments found her capable of being both sympathising and forgiving; these moments followed out in her daily life might have made Hester almost great.</s> <s>Now was the time, with her eyes full of tears and her lips trembling with emotion, for Annie Forest to have caught a glimpse of the divine in Hester; the hardness, the pride, the haughty spirit were all laid aside, and hers was the true child-heart as she knelt by the sleeping baby.</s> <s>Hester prayed earnestly at these moments, and, in truth, Nan did better for her than any sermon; better for her than even Mrs Willis's best influences.</s> <s>Nan was as the voice of God to her sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="736" id="girls.c0.p736"><s>Hester, in her very busy life, had no time to notice, however, a very slight and almost imperceptible change in bright little Nan.</s> <s>In the mornings she was in too great a hurry to pay much heed to the little one's chatter; in the afternoons she had scarcely an instant to devote to her, and when she saw her playing happily with the other children she was quite content, and always supposed that when a spare half-hour did come in her busy life Nan would rush to her with the old ecstasy, and give her the old devotion.</s> </p>

<p pid="737" id="girls.c0.p737"><s>One day, toward the end of a very fine May, the girls were all to go for a picnic to some woods about four miles away.</s> <s>They had looked forward for several days to this relaxation, and were in the highest state of delight and the wildest spirits.</s> <s>After an early dinner they were to drive in several large waggonettes to the place of _rendezvous_, where they were to be regaled with gypsy-tea, and were to have a few hours in the lovely Woods or Burn Castle, one of the show places of the neighbourhood.</s> <s>Mrs Willis had invited the Misses Bruce to accompany them, and they were all to leave the house punctually at two o'clock.</s> <s>The weather was wonderfully fine and warm, and it was decided that all the children, even Nan, should go.</s> </p>

<p pid="738" id="girls.c0.p738"><s>Perhaps none of the girls looked forward to this day's pleasure with greater joy than did Hester; she determined to make it a real holiday, and a real time of relaxation.</s> <s>She would forget her English theme; she would cease to worry herself about Marie Antoinette; she would cease to repeat her part in the coming play; and she would devote herself exclusively and determinedly to Nan's pleasure.</s> <s>She pictured the little one's raptures; she heard her gay shouts of joy, her ceaseless little rippling chatter, her baby glee, and, above all things, her intense happiness at being with her own Hetty for the greater part of a whole day.</s> <s>Hester would ride her on her shoulder, would race with her; all her usual, companions would be as nothing to her on this occasion, she would give herself up solely to Nan.</s> </p>

<p pid="739" id="girls.c0.p739"><s>As she was dressing that morning she said a word or two to the child about the coming treat.</s> </p>

<p pid="740" id="girls.c0.p740"><s>"We'll light a fire in the wood, Nan, and hang a kettle over it, and make tea--such good tea; won't it be nice?"</s> </p>

<p pid="741" id="girls.c0.p741"><s>Nan clapped her hands.</s> <s>"And may I take out my little ummabella (umbrella), case it might wain?" she asked anxiously.</s> </p>

<p pid="887" id="girls.c0.p887"><s>This mandate, however, produced woe and tribulation.</s> <s>The spoilt child screamed and beat her little hands, and worked herself up into such a pitch of excitement that that night she found her way in her sleep to Annie's room, and Annie had to quiet her by taking her into her bed.</s> <s>In the morning the doctor had to be sent for, and he instantly prescribed a day or two more of Annie's company for the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="895" id="girls.c0.p895"><s>Mrs Willis said nothing, but, holding the little hand, and accompanied by Annie, she went out of the play-room, across the stone hall, and through the baize doors until she reached her own delightful private sitting-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="902" id="girls.c0.p902" type="speech"><s>Mrs Willis counted for nothing at all with Nan--she did not consider her of the smallest importance, and after giving her a quick glance of some disdain she began to trot round the room on a voyage of discovery.</s> <s>Any moment Annie would come back--Annie had, indeed, probably gone to fetch the kitten, and would quickly return with it.</s> <s>She walked slowly round and round, keeping well away from that part of the room where Mrs Willis sat.</s> <s>Presently she found a very choice little china jug, which she carefully subtracted with her small fingers from a cabinet, which contained many valuable treasures.</s> <s>She sat down on the floor exactly beneath the cabinet, and began to play with her jug.</s> <s>She went through in eager pantomime a little game which Annie had invented for her, and imagined that she was a little milkmaid, and that the jug was full of sweet new milk; she called out to an imaginary set of purchasers, <qs/>"Want any milk?"<qe/> and then she floured some by way of drops of milk into the palm of her little hand, which she drank up in the name of her customers with considerable gusto.</s> <s>Presently, knocking the little jug with some vehemence on the floor she deprived it with one neat blow of its handle and spout.</s> <s>Mrs Willis was busily writing, and did not look up.</s> <s>Nan was not in the least disconcerted; she said aloud--</s> </p>

<p pid="903" id="girls.c0.p903"><s>"Poor tibby zug b'oke," and then she left the fragments on the floor, and started off on a fresh voyage of discovery.</s> <s>This time she dragged down a large photographic album on to a cushion, and, kneeling by it, began to look through the pictures, flapping the pages together with a loud noise, and laughing merrily as she did so.</s> <s>She was now much nearer to Mrs Willis, who was attracted by the sound, and looking up hastened to the rescue of one of her most precious collections of photographs.</s> </p>

<p pid="983" id="girls.c0.p983"><s>"Come on, girls," said Annie, now considerably frightened, while Phyllis, and Nora, and one or two more began to sob.</s> </p>

<p pid="995" id="girls.c0.p995"><s>Of all the prizes which attracted interest and aroused competition, the prize for English composition was this year the most popular.</s> <s>In the first place, this was known to be Mrs Willis's own favourite subject.</s> <s>She had a great wish that her girls should write intelligibly--she had a greater wish that, if possible, they should think.</s> </p>

<p pid="996" id="girls.c0.p996" type="speech"><s>"Never was there so much written and printed," she was often heard to say; <qs/>"but can anyone show me a book with thoughts in it?</s> <s>Can anyone show me, unless as a rare exception, a book which will live?</s> <s>Oh, yes, these books which issue from the press in thousands are, many of them, very smart, a great many of them clever, but they are thrown off too quickly.</s> <s>All great things, great books amongst them, must be evolved slowly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="997" id="girls.c0.p997"><s>Then she would tell her pupils what she considered the reason of this.</s> </p>

<p pid="998" id="girls.c0.p998" type="speech"><s>"In these days," she would say, <qs/>"all girls are what is called highly educated.</s> <s>Girls and boys alike must go in for competitive examinations, must take out diplomas, and must pass certain standards of excellence.</s> <s>The system is cramming from beginning to end.</s> <s>There is no time for reflection.</s> <s>In short, my dear girls, you swallow a great deal, but you do not digest your intellectual food."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="999" id="girls.c0.p999"><s>Mrs Willis hailed with pleasure any little dawnings of real thought in her girls' prize essays.</s> <s>More than once she bestowed the prize upon the essay which seemed to the girls the most crude and unfinished.</s> </p>

<p pid="1000" id="girls.c0.p1000" type="speech"><s>"Never mind," she would say, <qs/>"here is an idea--or at least half an idea.</s> <s>This little bit of composition is original, and not, at best, a poor imitation of Sir Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1001" id="girls.c0.p1001"><s>Thus the girls found a strong stimulus to be their real selves in these little essays, and the best of them chose their subject and let it ferment in their brains without the aid of books, except for the more technical parts.</s> </p>

<p pid="1002" id="girls.c0.p1002"><s>More than one girl in the school was surprised at Dora Russell exerting herself to try for the prize essay.</s> <s>She was just about to close her school career, and they could not make out why she roused herself to work for the most difficult prize, for which she would have to compete with any girl in the school who chose to make a similar attempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="1003" id="girls.c0.p1003"><s>Dora, however, had her own, not very high motive for making the attempt.</s> <s>She was a thoroughly accomplished girl, graceful in her appearance and manner; in short, just the sort of girl who would be supposed to do credit to a school.</s> <s>She played with finish, and even delicacy of touch.</s> <s>There was certainly no soul in her music, but neither were there any wrong notes.</s> <s>Her drawings were equally correct, her perspective good, her trees were real trees, and the colouring of her water-colour sketches was pure.</s> <s>She spoke French extremely well, and with a correct accent, and her German also was above the average.</s> <s>Nevertheless, Dora was commonplace, and those girls who knew her best spoke sarcastically, and smiled at one another when she alluded to her prize essay, and seemed confident of being the successful competitor.</s> </p>

<p pid="1004" id="girls.c0.p1004"><s>"You won't like to be beaten, Dora, say, by Annie Forest," they would laughingly remark; whereupon Dora's calm face would slightly flush and her lips would assume a very proud curve.</s> <s>If there was one thing she could not bear it was to be beaten.</s> </p>

<p pid="1005" id="girls.c0.p1005"><s>"Why do you try for it, Dora?" her class-fellows would ask; but here Dora made no reply: she kept her reason to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="1006" id="girls.c0.p1006"><s>The fact was Dora, who must be a copyist to the end of the chapter, and who could never to her latest day do anything original, had determined to try for the composition prize because she happened accidentally to hear a conversation between Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury, in which something was said about a gold locket with Mrs Willis's portrait inside.</s> </p>

<p pid="1007" id="girls.c0.p1007" type="speech"><s>Dora instantly jumped at the conclusion that this was to be the great prize bestowed upon the successful essayist.</s> <s>Delightful idea; how well the trinket would look round her smooth white throat!</s> <s>Instantly she determined to try for this prize, and of course as instantly the bare idea of defeat became intolerable to her.</s> <s>She went steadily and methodically to work.</s> <s>With extreme care she chose her subject.</s> <s>Knowing something of Mrs Willis's peculiarities, she determined that her theme should not be historical; she believed that she could express herself freely and with power if only she could secure an un-hackneyed subject.</s> <s>Suddenly an idea which she considered brilliant occurred to her.</s> <s>She would call her composition <qs/>"The River."<qe/></s> <s>This should not bear reference to Father Thames, or any other special river of England, but it should trace the windings of some fabled stream of Dora's imagination, which, as it flowed along, should tell something of the story of the many places by which it passed.</s> <s>Dora was charmed with her own thought, and worked hard, evening after evening, at her subject, covering sheets of manuscript paper with pencilled jottings, and arranging and rearranging her somewhat confused thoughts.</s> <s>She greatly admired a perfectly rounded period, and she was most particular as to the style in which she wrote.</s> <s>For the purpose of improving her style she even studied old volumes of Addison's _Spectator_; but after a time she gave up this course of study, for she found it so difficult to mould her English to Addison's that she came to the comfortable conclusion that Addison was decidedly obsolete, and that if she wished to do full justice to "The River" she must trust to her own unaided genius.</s> </p>

<p pid="1008" id="girls.c0.p1008"><s>At last the first ten pages were written.</s> <s>The subject was entered upon with considerable flourishes, and some rather apt poetical quotations from a book containing a collection of poems; the river itself had already left its home in the mountain, and was careering merrily past sunny meadows and little rural, impossible cottages, where the golden-haired children played.</s> </p>

<p pid="1009" id="girls.c0.p1009" type="speech"><s>Dora made a very neat copy of her essay so far.</s> <s>She now began to see her way clearly--there would be a very powerful passage as the river approached the murky town.</s> <s>Here, indeed, would be room for powerful and pathetic writing.</s> <s>She wondered if she might venture so far as to hide a suicide in her rushing waters; and then at last the brawling river would lose itself in the sea; and, of course, there would not be the smallest connection between her river, and Kingsley's well-known song, <qs/>"Clear and cool."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1013" id="girls.c0.p1013"><s>Hester was a very careful little student, and as she prepared herself for the great work.</s> <s>She thought little or nothing about the prize; she only wanted to do justice to the unfortunate Queen of France.</s> <s>She was in bed that night, and just dropping off to sleep, when she suddenly remembered that she had left a volume of French poetry on her school-desk.</s> <s>This was against the rules, and she knew that Miss Danesbury would confiscate the book in the morning, and would not let her have it back for a week.</s> <s>Hester particularly wanted this special book just now, as some of the verses bore reference to her subject, and she could scarcely get on with her essay without having it to refer to She must lose no time in instantly beginning to write her essay, and to do without her book of poetry for a week would be a serious injury to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1018" id="girls.c0.p1018" type="speech"><s>She knew that Hester Thornton was making what she was pleased to term a poor little attempt at trying for the same prize.</s> <s>Hester would scarcely venture to copy anything from Dora's essay; she would probably be discouraged, poor girl, in working any longer at her own composition; but Dora felt that the temptation to read <qs/>"The River,"<qe/> as far as it had gone, to Hester was really too great to be resisted.</s> <s>Accordingly, after dinner she graciously invited Hester to accompany her to a bower in the garden, where the two friends might revel over the results of Dora's extraordinary talents.</s> </p>

<p pid="1019" id="girls.c0.p1019"><s>Hester was still, to a certain extent, under Dora's influence, and had not the courage to tell her that she intended to be very busy over her own essay this afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="1020" id="girls.c0.p1020" type="speech"><s>"Now, Hester, dear," said Dora, when they found themselves both seated in the bower, <qs/>"you are the only girl in the school to whom I could confide the subject of my great essay.</s> <s>I really believe that I have hit on something absolutely original.</s> <s>My dear child, I hope you won't allow yourself to be discouraged.</s> <s>I fear that you won't have much heart to go on with your theme after you have read my words; but, never mind, dear, it will be good practice for you, and you know it _was_ rather silly to go in for a prize which I intended to compete for."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1021" id="girls.c0.p1021"><s>"May I read your essay, please, Dora?" asked Hester.</s> <s>"I am very much interested in my own study, and, whether I win the prize or not, I shall always remember the pleasure I took in writing it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1022" id="girls.c0.p1022"><s>"What subject did you select, dear?" inquired Miss Russell.</s> </p>

<p pid="1023" id="girls.c0.p1023"><s>"Well, I am attempting a little sketch of Marie Antoinette."</s> </p>

<p pid="1024" id="girls.c0.p1024"><s>"Ah, hackneyed, my dear girl--terribly hackneyed; but, of course, I don't mean to discourage you.</s> <s>_Now_!--I draw a life--picture, and I call it `The River.'</s> <s>See how it begins--why, I declare I know the words by heart, `_As our eyes rest on this clear and limpid stream, as we see the sun sparkle_.'</s> <s>My dear Hester, you shall read me my essay aloud.</s> <s>I shall like to hear my own words from your lips, and you have really a pretty accent, dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="1025" id="girls.c0.p1025"><s>Hester folded back the brown-paper cover, and wanting to have her task over began to read nastily.</s> <s>But, as her eyes rested on the first lines, she turned to her companion, and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="1026" id="girls.c0.p1026"><s>"Did you not tell me that your essay was called `The River'?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1027" id="girls.c0.p1027"><s>"Yes, dear; the full title is `The Windings of a Noble River.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="1028" id="girls.c0.p1028"><s>"That's very odd," replied Hester.</s> <s>"What I see here is `The Meanderings of a Muddy Stream.'</s> <s>`_As our dull orbs rest on this turbid water on which the sun cannot possibly shine_.'</s> <s>Why, Dora, this cannot be your essay, and yet, surely, it is your handwriting."</s> </p>

<p pid="1029" id="girls.c0.p1029" type="speech"><s>Dora, with her face suddenly flushing a vivid crimson, snatched the manuscript from Hester's hand, and looked over it eagerly.</s> <s>Alas! there was no doubt.</s> <s>The title of this essay was <qs/>"The Meanderings of a Muddy Stream,"<qe/> and the words which immediately followed were a smart and ridiculous parody on her own high-flown sentences.</s> <s>The resemblance to her handwriting was perfect.</s> <s>The brown-paper cover, neatly sewn on to protect the white manuscript, was undoubtedly her cover; the very paper on which the words were written seemed in all particulars the same.</s> <s>Dora turned the sheets eagerly, and here for the first time she saw a difference.</s> <s>Only four or five pages of the nonsense essay had been attempted, and the night before, when finishing her toil, she had proudly numbered her tenth page.</s> <s>She looked through the whole thing, turning leaf after leaf, while her cheeks were crimson, and her hands trembled.</s> <s>In the first moment of horrible humiliation and dismay she literally could not speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="1030" id="girls.c0.p1030"><s>At last, springing to her feet, and confronting the astonished and almost frightened Hester, she found her voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="1031" id="girls.c0.p1031"><s>"Hester, you must help me in this.</s> <s>The most dreadful, the most atrocious fraud has been committed.</s> <s>Some one has been base enough, audacious enough, wicked enough, to go to my desk privately, and take away my real essay--my work over which I have laboured and toiled.</s> <s>The expressions of my--my--yes, I will say it--my genius, have been ruthlessly burnt, or otherwise made away with, and _this_ thing has been put in their place.</s> <s>Hester, why don't you speak--why do you stare at me like this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1032" id="girls.c0.p1032" type="speech"><s>"I am puzzled by the writing," said Hester; <qs/>"the writing is yours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1033" id="girls.c0.p1033"><s>"The writing is mine!--oh, you wicked girl!</s> <s>The writing is an imitation of mine--a feeble and poor imitation.</s> <s>I thought, Hester, that by this time you knew your friend's handwriting.</s> <s>I thought that one in whom I have confided--one whom I have stooped to notice because I fancied we had a community of soul, would not be so ridiculous and so silly as to mistake this writing for mine.</s> <s>Look again, please, Hester Thornton, and tell me if I am ever so vulgar as to cross my _t's_.</s> <s>You know I _always_ loop them; and do I make a capital B in this fashion?</s> <s>And do I indulge in flourishes?</s> <s>I grant you that the general effect to a casual observer would be something the same, but you, Hester--I thought you knew me better."</s> </p>

<p pid="1034" id="girls.c0.p1034"><s>Here Hester, examining the false essay, had to confess that the crossed _t's_ and the flourishes were unlike Miss Russell's calligraphy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1035" id="girls.c0.p1035"><s>"It is a forgery, most cleverly done," said Dora.</s> <s>"There is such a thing, Hester, as being wickedly clever.</s> <s>This spiteful, cruel attempt to injure another can have but proceeded from one _very_ low order of mind.</s> <s>Hester, there has been plenty of favouritism in this school, but do you suppose I shall allow such a thing as this to pass over unsearched into?</s> <s>If necessary, I shall ask my father to interfere.</s> <s>This is a slight--an outrage; but the whole mystery shall at last be cleared up.</s> <s>Miss Good and Miss Danesbury shall be informed at once, and the very instant Mrs Willis returns she shall be told what a serpent she has been nursing in this false, wicked girl, Annie Forest."</s> </p>

<p pid="1036" id="girls.c0.p1036"><s>"Stop, Dora," said Hester suddenly.</s> <s>She sprang to her feet, clasping her hands, and her colour varied rapidly from white to red.</s> <s>A sudden light poured in upon her, and she was about to speak when something-- quite a small, trivial thing--occurred.</s> <s>She only saw little Nan in the distance flying swiftly, with outstretched arms, to meet a girl, whose knees she clasped in baby ecstasy.</s> <s>The girl stooped down and kissed the little face, and the round arms were flung around her neck.</s> <s>The next instant Annie Forest continued her walk alone, and Nan, looking wistfully back after her, went in another direction with her nurse.</s> <s>The whole scene took but a moment to enact, but as she watched, Hester's face grew hard and white.</s> <s>She sat down again, with her lips firmly pressed together.</s> </p>

<p pid="1037" id="girls.c0.p1037"><s>"What is it, Hester?" exclaimed Dora.</s> <s>"What were you going to say?</s> <s>You surely know nothing about this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1038" id="girls.c0.p1038"><s>"Well, Dora, I am not the guilty person.</s> <s>I was only going to remark that you cannot be _sure_ it is Annie Forest."</s> </p>

<p pid="1039" id="girls.c0.p1039"><s>"Oh, so you are going to take that horrid girl's part now?</s> <s>I wonder at you!</s> <s>She all but killed your little sister, and then stole her love away from you.</s> <s>Did you see the little thing now, how she flew to her?</s> <s>Why, she never kisses you like that."</s> </p>

<p pid="1040" id="girls.c0.p1040"><s>"I know--I know," said Hester, and she turned away her face with a groan, and leant forward against the rustic bench, pressing her hot forehead down on her hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="1041" id="girls.c0.p1041"><s>"You'll have your triumph, Hester, when Miss Forest is publicly expelled," said Dora, tapping her lightly on the shoulder, and then, taking up the forged essay, she went slowly out of the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="1042" id="girls.c0.p1042"><s>CHAPTER THIRTY ONE.</s> <s>GOOD AND BAD ANGELS.</s> </p>

<p pid="1043" id="girls.c0.p1043"><s>Hester stayed behind in the shady little arbour, and then, on that soft spring day, while the birds sang overhead, and the warm light breezes came in and fanned her hot cheeks, good angels and bad drew near to fight for a victory.</s> <s>Which would conquer?</s> <s>Hester had many faults, but hitherto she had been honourable and truthful; her sins had been those of pride and jealousy, but she had never told a falsehood in her life.</s> <s>She, knew perfectly--she trembled as the full knowledge overpowered her--that she had it in her power to exonerate Annie.</s> <s>She could not in the least imagine now stupid Susan Drummond could contrive and carry out such a clever and deep-laid plot; but she knew also that if she related what she had seen with her own eyes the night before, she would probably give such a clew to the apparent mystery that the truth would come to light.</s> </p>

<p pid="1044" id="girls.c0.p1044"><s>If Annie was cleared from this accusation, doubtless the old story of her supposed guilt with regard to Mrs Willis's caricature would also be read with its right key.</s> <s>Hester was a clever and sharp girl; and the fact of seeing Susan Drummond in the school-room in the dead of night opened her eyes also to one or two other apparent little mysteries.</s> <s>While Susan was her own room-mate she had often given a passing wonder to the fact of her extraordinary desire to overcome her sleepiness, and had laughed over the expedients Susan had used to wake at all moments.</s> </p>

<p pid="1045" id="girls.c0.p1045"><s>These things, at the time, had scarcely given her a moment's serious reflection; but now she pondered them carefully, and became more and more certain that, for some inexplicable and unfathomable reason, sleepy, and apparently innocent, Susan Drummond wished to sow the seeds of mischief and discord in the school.</s> <s>Hester was sure that if she chose to speak now she could clear poor Annie, and restore her to her lost place in Mrs Willis's favour.</s> </p>

<p pid="1046" id="girls.c0.p1046"><s>Should she do so?--ah! should she?</s> <s>Her lips trembled, her colour came and went as the angels, good and bad, fought hard for victory within her.</s> <s>How she had longed to revenge herself on Annie!</s> <s>How cordially she had hated her!</s> <s>Now was the moment of her revenge.</s> <s>She had but to remain silent now, and to let matters take their course; she had but to hold her tongue about the little incident of last night, and, without any doubt, circumstantial evidence would point at Annie Forest, and she would be expelled from the school.</s> <s>Mrs Willis must condemn her now.</s> <s>Mr Everard must pronounce her guilty now.</s> <s>She would go, and when the coast was again clear the love which she had taken from Hester--the precious love of Hester's only little sister--would return.</s> </p>

<p pid="1047" id="girls.c0.p1047"><s>"You will be miserable: you will be miserable," whispered the good angels sorrowfully in her ear; but she did not listen to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1048" id="girls.c0.p1048"><s>"I said I would revenge myself, and this is my opportunity," she murmured.</s> <s>"Silence--just simply silence--will be my revenge."</s> </p>

<p pid="1049" id="girls.c0.p1049"><s>Then the good angels went sorrowfully back to their Father in heaven, and the wicked angels rejoiced.</s> <s>Hester had fallen very low.</s> </p>

<p pid="1050" id="girls.c0.p1050"><s>CHAPTER THIRTY TWO.</s> <s>FRESH SUSPICIONS.</s> </p>

<p pid="1051" id="girls.c0.p1051"><s>Mrs Willis was not at home many hours before Dora Russell begged for an interview with her.</s> <s>Annie had not as yet heard anything of the changed essay; for Dora had resolved to keep the thing a secret until Mrs Willis herself took the matter in hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1052" id="girls.c0.p1052"><s>Annie was feeling not a little anxious and depressed.</s> <s>She was sorry now that she had led the girls that wild escapade through the wood.</s> <s>Phyllis and Nora were both suffering from heavy colds in consequence, and Susan Drummond was looking more pasty about her complexion, and was more dismally sleepy than usual.</s> <s>Annie was going through her usual season of intense remorse after one of her wild pranks.</s> <s>No one repented with more apparent fervour than she did, and yet no one so easily succumbed to the next temptation.</s> <s>Had Annie been alone in the matter she would have gone straight to Mrs Willis and confessed all; but she could not do this without implicating her companions, who would have screamed with horror at the very suggestion.</s> </p>

<p pid="1053" id="girls.c0.p1053"><s>All the girls were more or less depressed by the knowledge that the gypsy woman, Mother Rachel, shared their secret; and they often whispered together as to the chances of her betraying them.</s> <s>Old Betty they could trust; for Betty, the cake-woman, had been an arch-conspirator with the naughty girls of Lavender House from time immemorial.</s> <s>Betty had always managed to provide their stolen suppers for them, and had been most accommodating in the matter of pay.</s> <s>Yes, with Betty they felt they were safe; but Mother Rachel was a different person.</s> <s>She might like to be paid a few more sixpences for her silence; she might hover about the grounds; she might be noticed.</s> <s>At any moment she might boldly demand an interview with Mrs Willis.</s> </p>

<p pid="1054" id="girls.c0.p1054"><s>"I'm awfully afraid of Mother Rachel," Phyllis moaned, as she shivered under the influence of her bad cold.</s> </p>

<p pid="1056" id="girls.c0.p1056"><s>On the day of Mrs Willis's return, Annie was pacing up and down the shady walk, and indulging in some rather melancholy and regretful thoughts, when Susan Drummond and Mary Morris rushed up to her, white with terror.</s> </p>

<p pid="1057" id="girls.c0.p1057"><s>"She's down there by the copse, and she's beckoning to us!</s> <s>Oh, do come with us--do, darling, dear Annie."</s> </p>

<p pid="1058" id="girls.c0.p1058" type="speech"><s>"There's no use in it," replied Annie; <qs/>"Mother Rachel wants money, and I am not going to give her any.</s> <s>Don't be afraid of her, girls, and don't give her money.</s> <s>After all, why should she tell on us? she would gain nothing by doing so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1059" id="girls.c0.p1059" type="speech"><s>"Oh, yes, she would, Annie--she would, Annie," said Mary Morris, beginning to sob; <qs/>"oh, do come with us, do!</s> <s>We must pacify her, we really must."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1060" id="girls.c0.p1060" type="speech"><s>"I can't come now," said Annie; <qs/>"hark! some one is calling me.</s> <s>Yes, Miss Danesbury--what is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1061" id="girls.c0.p1061"><s>"Mrs Willis wishes to see you at once, Annie, in her private sitting-room," replied Miss Danesbury; and Annie, wondering not a little, but quite unsuspicious, ran off.</s> </p>

<p pid="1062" id="girls.c0.p1062"><s>The fact, however, of her having deliberately disobeyed Mrs Willis, and done something which she knew would greatly pain her, brought a shade of embarrassment to her usually candid face.</s> <s>She had also to confess to herself that she did not feel quite so comfortable about Mother Rachel as she had given Mary Morris and Susan Drummond to understand.</s> <s>Her steps lagged more and more as she approached the house, and she wished, oh, how longingly! oh, how regretfully! that she had not been naughty and wild and disobedient in her beloved teacher's absence.</s> </p>

<p pid="1063" id="girls.c0.p1063"><s>"But where is the use of regretting what is done?" she said, half aloud.</s> <s>"I know I can never be good--never, never!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1064" id="girls.c0.p1064"><s>She pushed aside the heavy velvet curtains which shaded the door of the private sitting-room, and went in, to find Mrs Willis seated by her desk, very pale and tired and unhappy looking, while Dora Russell, with crimson spots on her cheeks and a very angry glitter in her eyes, stood by the mantelpiece.</s> </p>

<p pid="1065" id="girls.c0.p1065"><s>"Come here, Annie dear," said Mrs Willis in her usual gentle and affectionate tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="1066" id="girls.c0.p1066"><s>Annie's first wild impulse was to rush to her governess's side, to fling her arms round her neck, and, as a child would confess to her mother, to tell her all that story of the walk through the wood, and the stolen picnic in the fairies' field.</s> <s>Three things, however, restrained her-- she must not relieve her own troubles at the expense of betraying others; she could not, even if she were willing, say a word in the presence of this cold and angry-looking Dora; in the third place, Mrs Willis looked very tired and very sad.</s> <s>Not for worlds would she add to her troubles at this instant.</s> <s>She came into the room, however, with a slight hesitation of manner, and a clouded brow, which caused Mrs Willis to watch her with anxiety, and Dora with triumph.</s> </p>

<p pid="1067" id="girls.c0.p1067"><s>"Come here, Annie," repeated the governess.</s> <s>"I want to speak to you.</s> <s>Something very dishonourable and disgraceful has been done in my absence."</s> </p>

<p pid="1068" id="girls.c0.p1068"><s>Annie's face suddenly became as white as a sheet.</s> <s>Could the gypsy-mother have already betrayed them all?</s> </p>

<p pid="1069" id="girls.c0.p1069"><s>Mrs Willis, noticing her too evident confusion, continued in a voice, which, in spite of herself, became stern and severe.</s> </p>

<p pid="1070" id="girls.c0.p1070"><s>"I shall expect the truth at any cost, my dear.</s> <s>Look at this manuscript-book.</s> <s>Do you know anything of the handwriting?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1071" id="girls.c0.p1071"><s>"Why, it is yours, of course, Dora," said Annie, who was now absolutely bewildered.</s> </p>

<p pid="1072" id="girls.c0.p1072"><s>"It is _not_ mine," began Dora, but Mrs Willis held up her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1073" id="girls.c0.p1073"><s>"Allow me to speak, Miss Russell.</s> <s>I can best explain matters.</s> <s>Annie, during my absence some one has been guilty of a very base and wicked act.</s> <s>One of the girls in this school has gone secretly to Dora Russell's desk, and taken away ten pages of an essay which she had called `The River,' and which she was preparing for the prize competition next month.</s> <s>Instead of Dora's essay this that you now see was put in its place.</s> <s>Examine it, my dear.</s> <s>Can you tell me anything about it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1074" id="girls.c0.p1074"><s>Annie took the manuscript-book, and turned the leaves.</s> </p>

<p pid="1075" id="girls.c0.p1075" type="speech"><s>"Is it meant for a parody?" she asked, after a pause; <qs/>"it sounds ridiculous.</s> <s>No, Mrs Willis, I know nothing whatever about it; some one has imitated Dora's handwriting.</s> <s>I cannot imagine who is the culprit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1076" id="girls.c0.p1076"><s>She threw the manuscript-book with a certain easy carelessness on the table by her side, and glanced up with a twinkle of mirth in her eyes at Dora.</s> </p>

<p pid="1077" id="girls.c0.p1077" type="speech"><s>"I suppose it is meant for a clever parody," she repeated; <qs/>"at least it is amusing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1079" id="girls.c0.p1079" type="speech"><s>"We have not sent for you, Annie," said her teacher, <qs/>"to ask you your opinion of the parody, but to try and get you to throw light on the subject.</s> <s>We must find out, and at once, who has been so wicked as to deliberately injure another girl."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1080" id="girls.c0.p1080"><s>"But why have you sent for _me_?" asked Annie, drawing herself up, and speaking with a little shade of haughtiness.</s> </p>

<p pid="1081" id="girls.c0.p1081" type="speech"><s>"Because," said Dora Russell, who could no longer contain her outraged feelings, <qs/>"because you alone can throw light on it--because you alone in the school are base enough to do anything so mean--because you alone can caricature."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1119" id="girls.c0.p1119"><s>It was, however, in the matter of stolen picnics, of grand feasts in the old attic, etc, etc, that Betty was truly great.</s> <s>No one so clever as she in concealing a basket of delicious eatables, no one knew better what school-girls liked.</s> <s>She undoubtedly charged her own prices, but what she gave was of the best, and Betty was truly in her element when she had an order from the young ladies of Lavender House for a grand secret feast.</s> </p>

<p pid="1121" id="girls.c0.p1121"><s>On the occasion of the picnic to the fairies' field Betty had, indeed, surpassed herself in the delicious eatables she had provided; all had gone smoothly, the basket had been placed in a secure hiding-place under the thick laurel.</s> <s>It was to be fetched away by Betty herself at an early hour on the following morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="1122" id="girls.c0.p1122"><s>No wonder Susan was perplexed as she paced about and pretended to warm herself.</s> <s>It was a June evening, but the weather was still a little cold.</s> <s>Susan remembered now that.</s> <s>Betty had not come to her favourite station at the stile for several days.</s> <s>Was it possible that the old woman was ill?</s> <s>As this idea occurred to her, Susan became more alarmed.</s> <s>She knew that there was very little chance of the basket remaining long in concealment.</s> <s>Rover might any day remember his pleasant picnic with affection, and drag the white basket from under the laurel-bush.</s> <s>Michael the gardener would be certain to see it when next he cleaned up the back avenue.</s> <s>Oh, it was more than dangerous to leave it there, and yet Susan knew of no better hiding-place.</s> <s>A sudden idea came to her: she pulled out her pretty little watch, and saw that she need not return to the house for another half-hour.</s> <s>"Suppose she ran as fast as possible to Betty's little cottage, and begged of the old woman to come by the first light in the morning and fetch away the basket?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1123" id="girls.c0.p1123"><s>The moment Susan conceived this idea she resolved to put it into execution.</s> <s>She looked around her hastily; no teacher was in sight, Miss Good was away at the lodge, Miss Danesbury was playing with the little children.</s> <s>Mademoiselle, she knew, had gone indoors with a bad headache.</s> <s>She left the broad walk where she had been desired to stay, and, plunging into the shrubbery, soon reached Betty's paling.</s> <s>In a moment she had climbed the bars, had jumped lightly into the field, and was running as fast as possible in the direction of Betty's cottage.</s> <s>She reached the high road, and started and trembled violently as a carriage with some ladies and gentlemen passed her.</s> <s>She thought she recognised the faces of the two little Misses Bruce, but did not dare to look at them, and hurried panting along the road, and hoping she might be mistaken.</s> </p>

<p pid="1172" id="girls.c0.p1172"><s>Susan Drummond got back to Lavender House without apparent discovery.</s> <s>She was certainly late when she took her place in the class-room for her next day's preparation; but, beyond a very sharp reprimand from Mademoiselle, no notice was taken of this fact.</s> <s>She managed to whisper to Nora and Phyllis that the basket would be moved by the first dawn the next morning, and the little girls went to bed happier in consequence.</s> <s>Nothing ever could disturb Susan's slumbers, and that night she certainly slept without rocking.</s> <s>As she was getting into bed she ventured to tell Annie how successfully she had manoeuvred; but Annie received her news with the most absolute indifference, looking at her for a moment with a queer smile, and then saying--</s> </p>

<p pid="1173" id="girls.c0.p1173"><s>"My own wish is that this should be found out.</s> <s>As a matter of course, I sha'n't betray you, girls; but as things now stand I am anxious that Mrs Willis should know the very worst of me."</s> </p>

<p pid="1174" id="girls.c0.p1174"><s>After a remark which Susan considered so simply idiotic, there was, of course, no further conversation between the two girls.</s> </p>

<p pid="1175" id="girls.c0.p1175"><s>Moses Moore had certainly promised Betty to rise soon after dawn on the following morning and go to Lavender House to carry off the basket from under the laurel-tree.</s> <s>Moses, a remarkably indolent lad, had been stimulated by the thought of the delicious cherries which would be his as soon as he brought the basket to Betty.</s> <s>He had cleverly stipulated that a quart--not a pint--of cherries was to be his reward, and he looked forward with considerable pleasure to picking them himself, and putting a few extra ones into his mouth on the sly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1176" id="girls.c0.p1176"><s>Moses was not at all the kind of boy who would have scrupled to steal a few cherries; but in this particular old Betty, ill as she was, was too sharp for him, or for any of the other village lads.</s> <s>Her bed was drawn up close to her little window, and her window looked directly on to the two cherry trees.</s> <s>Never, to all appearance, did Betty close her eyes.</s> <s>However early the hour might be in which a village boy peeped over the wall of her garden, he always saw her white night-cap moving, and he knew that her bright blue eyes would be on him, and he would be proclaimed a thief all over the place before many minutes were over.</s> </p>

<p pid="1177" id="girls.c0.p1177"><s>Moses, therefore, was very glad to secure his cherries by fair means, as he could not obtain them by foul; and he went to bed and to sleep determined to be off on his errand with the dawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="1178" id="girls.c0.p1178"><s>A very natural thing, however, happened.</s> <s>Moses, unaccustomed to getting up at half-past three in the morning, never opened his eyes until the church clock struck five.</s> <s>Then he started upright, rubbed and rubbed at his sleepy orbs, tumbled into his clothes, and, softly opening the cottage door, set off on his errand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1179" id="girls.c0.p1179"><s>The fact of his being nearly an hour and a half late did not trouble him in the least.</s> <s>In any case, he would get to Lavender House before six o'clock, and would have consumed his cherries in less than an hour from that date.</s> </p>

<p pid="1180" id="girls.c0.p1180"><s>Moses sauntered gayly along the roads, whistling as he went, and occasionally tossing his battered cap in the air.</s> <s>He often lingered on his way, now to cut down a particularly tempting switch from the hedge, now to hunt for a possible bird's nest.</s> <s>It was very, nearly six o'clock when he reached the back avenue, swung himself over the gate, which was locked, and ran softly on the dewy grass in the direction of the laurel-bush.</s> <s>Old Betty had given him most careful instructions, and he was far too sharp a lad to forget what was necessary for the obtaining of a quart of cherries.</s> <s>He found his tree, and lay flat down on the ground in order to pull out the basket.</s> <s>His fingers had just clasped the handle when there came a sudden interruption--a rush, a growl, and some very sharp teeth had inserted themselves into the back of his ragged jacket.</s> <s>Poor Moses found himself, to his horror, in the clutches of a great mastiff.</s> <s>The creature held him tight, and laid one heavy paw on him to prevent him rising.</s> </p>

<p pid="1181" id="girls.c0.p1181"><s>Under these circumstances, Moses thought it quite unnecessary to retain any self-control.</s> <s>He shrieked, he screamed, he wriggled; his piercing yells filled the air, and, fortunately for him, his being two hours too late brought assistance to his aid.</s> <s>Michael, the gardener, and a strong boy who helped him, rushed to the spot, and liberated the terrified lad, who, after all, was only frightened, for Rover had satisfied himself with tearing his jacket to pieces, not himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="1261" id="girls.c0.p1261"><s>However calmly or however peacefully Annie slept that night, poor Hester did not close her eyes.</s> <s>The white face of the girl she had wronged and injured kept rising before her.</s> <s>Why had she so deceived Annie?</s> <s>Why from the very first had she turned from her and misjudged her, and misrepresented her?</s> <s>Was Annie, indeed, all bad?</s> <s>Hester had to own to herself that to-night Annie was better than she--was greater than she.</s> <s>Could she now have undone the past, she would not have acted as she had done; she would not for the sake of a little paltry revenge have defiled her conscience with a lie, have told her governess that she could throw no light on the circumstance of the stolen essay.</s> <s>This was the first lie Hester had ever told; she was naturally both straightforward and honourable, but her sin of sins, that which made her hard and almost unlovable, was an intensely proud and haughty spirit.</s> <s>She was very sorry she had told that lie; she was very sorry she had yielded to that temptation; but not for worlds would she now humble herself to confess-- not for worlds would she let the school know of her cowardice and shame.</s> <s>No, if there was no other means of clearing:</s> <s>Annie except through her confession, she must remain with the shadow of this sin over her to her dying day.</s> </p>

<p pid="1262" id="girls.c0.p1262"><s>Hester, however, was now really unhappy, and also truly sorry for poor Annie.</s> <s>Could she have got off without disgrace or punishment, she would have been truly glad to see Annie exonerated.</s> <s>She was quite certain that Susan Drummond was at the bottom of all the mischief which had been done lately at Lavender House.</s> <s>She could not make out how stupid Susan was clever enough to caricature and to imitate peoples' hands.</s> <s>Still she was convinced that she was the guilty person, and she wondered and wondered if she could induce Susan to come forward and confess the truth, and so save Annie without bringing her, Hester, into any trouble.</s> </p>

<p pid="1263" id="girls.c0.p1263"><s>She resolved to speak to Susan, and without confessing that she had been in the school-room on the night the essay was changed, to let her know plainly that she suspected her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1264" id="girls.c0.p1264"><s>She became much calmer when she determined to carry out this resolve, and toward morning she fell asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="1265" id="girls.c0.p1265"><s>She was awakened at a very early hour by little Nan clambering over the side of her crib, and cuddling down cosily in a way she loved by Hester's side.</s> </p>

<p pid="1267" id="girls.c0.p1267"><s>Hester had then to rouse herself, and enter into an animated conversation on the subject of flies generally, and in especial she had to talk of that particular fly which would perambulate on the ceiling over Nan's head.</s> </p>

<p pid="1270" id="girls.c0.p1270"><s>Hester's hour of trial, however, was at hand, and before that day was over she was to experience that awful emptiness and desolation which those know whom God is punishing.</s> </p>

<p pid="1273" id="girls.c0.p1273"><s>After school, however, Annie did not join her companions in the grounds, but went up to her bedroom, where, by Mrs Willis's orders, she was to remain until the girls went in.</s> <s>She was to take her own exercise later in the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="1275" id="girls.c0.p1275"><s>They wondered, many of them, if Annie would ever be brought to confess her sin, and, if not, how Mrs Willis would act toward her.</s> <s>Dora Russell said in her most contemptuous tones--</s> </p>

<p pid="1280" id="girls.c0.p1280"><s>Look, however, as she would, nowhere could she find Miss Drummond.</s> <s>She called and called, but no sleepy voice replied.</s> <s>Susan, indeed, knew better; she had curled herself up in a hammock which hung between the boughs of a shady tree, and though Hester passed under her very head, she was sucking lollipops and going off comfortably into the land of dreams, and had no intention of replying.</s> <s>Hester wandered down the shady walk, and at its farther end she was gratified by the sight of little Nan, who, under her nurse's charge, was trying to string daisies on the grass.</s> <s>Hester sat down by her side, and Nan climbed over and made fine havoc of her neat print dress, and laughed, and was at her merriest and best.</s> </p>

<p pid="1281" id="girls.c0.p1281"><s>"I hear say that that naughty Miss Forest has done something out-and-out disgraceful," whispered the nurse.</s> </p>

<p pid="1300" id="girls.c0.p1300"><s>Her face was very white, her eyes shone, her lips expressed a firm and almost obstinate determination.</s> <s>With all her usual impulsiveness, she decided on a course of action--she snatched up a piece of paper and scribbled a hasty line:</s> </p>

<p pid="1302" id="girls.c0.p1302"><s>"Dear Mother-friend,--However badly you think of Annie, Annie loves you with all her heart.</s> <s>Forgive me, I must go myself to look for little Nan.</s> <s>That tall, dark woman is a gipsy--I have seen her before; her name is Mother Rachel.</s> <s>Tell Hetty I won't return until I bring her little sister back.--Your repentant and sorrowful Annie."</s> </p>

<p pid="1303" id="girls.c0.p1303"><s>Annie twisted up the note, directed it to Mrs Willis, and left it on her dressing-table.</s> </p>

<p pid="1304" id="girls.c0.p1304"><s>Then, with a wonderful amount of forethought for her, she emptied the contents of a little purse into a tiny gingham bag, which she fastened inside the front of her dress.</s> <s>She put on her shady hat, and threw a shawl across her arm, and then, slipping softly downstairs, she went out through the deserted kitchens, down the back avenue, and past the laurel-bush, until she came to the stile which led into the wood--she was going straight to the gipsies' encampment.</s> </p>

<p pid="1305" id="girls.c0.p1305"><s>Annie, with some of the gipsy's characteristics in her own blood, had always taken an extraordinary interest in these queer wandering people.</s> <s>Gipsies had a fascination for her, she loved stories about them; if a gipsy encampment was near, she always begged the teachers to walk in that direction.</s> <s>Annie had a very vivid imagination, and in the days when she reigned as favourite in the school she used to make up stories for the express benefit of her companions.</s> <s>These stories, as a rule, always turned upon the gipsies.</s> <s>Many and many a time had the girls of Lavender House almost gasped with horror as Annie described the queer ways of these people.</s> <s>For her, personally, their wildness and their freedom had a certain fascination, and she was heard in her gayest moments to remark that she would rather like to be stolen and adopted by a gipsy tribe.</s> </p>

<p pid="1306" id="girls.c0.p1306"><s>Whenever Annie had an opportunity she chatted with the gipsy wives, and allowed them to tell her fortune, and listened eagerly to their narratives.</s> <s>When a little child she had once for several months been under the care of a nurse who was a reclaimed gipsy, and this girl had given her all kinds of information about them.</s> <s>Annie often felt that she quite loved these wild people, and Mother Rachel was the first gipsy she cordially shrank from and disliked.</s> </p>

<p pid="1307" id="girls.c0.p1307"><s>When the little girl started now on her wild-goose chase after Nan she was by no means devoid of a plan of action.</s> <s>The knowledge she had taken so many years to acquire came to her aid, and she determined to use it for Nan's benefit.</s> <s>She knew that the gipsies, with all their wandering and erratic habits, had a certain attachment, if not for homes, at least for sites; she knew that as a rule they encamped over and over again in the same place; she knew that their wanderings were conducted with method, and their apparently lawless lives governed by strict self-made rules.</s> </p>

<p pid="1308" id="girls.c0.p1308"><s>Annie made straight now for the encampment, which stood in a little dell at the other side of the fairies' field.</s> <s>Here for weeks past the gipsies' tents had been seen; here the gipsy children had played, and the men and women smoked and lain about in the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="1309" id="girls.c0.p1309"><s>Anne entered the small field now, but uttered no exclamation of surprise when she found that all the tents, with the exception of one, had been removed, and that this tent also was being rapidly taken down by a man and a girl, while a tall boy stood by, holding a donkey by the bridle.</s> </p>

<p pid="1310" id="girls.c0.p1310"><s>Annie wasted no time in looking for Nan here.</s> <s>Before the girl and the man could see her, she darted behind a bush, and removing her little bag of money, hid it carefully under some long grass; then she pulled a very bright yellow sash out of her pocket, tied it round her blue cotton dress, and leaving her little shawl also on the ground, tripped gayly up to the tent.</s> </p>

<p pid="1311" id="girls.c0.p1311"><s>She saw with pleasure that the girl who was helping the man was about her own size.</s> <s>She went up and touched her on the shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="1329" id="girls.c0.p1329"><s>When Zillah, her old gipsy nurse, had charmed her long ago with gipsy legends and stories, Annie had always begged to hear about the fair English children whom the gipsies stole, and Zillah had let her into some secrets which partly accounted for the fact that so few of these children are ever recovered.</s> </p>

<p pid="1330" id="girls.c0.p1330"><s>She walked very fast now; her depression was gone, a great excitement, a great longing, a great hope, keeping her up.</s> <s>She forgot that she had eaten nothing since breakfast: she forgot everything in all the world now but her great love for little Nan, and her desire to lay down her very life, if necessary, to rescue Nan from the terrible fate which awaited her if she was brought up as a gipsy's child.</s> </p>

<p pid="1331" id="girls.c0.p1331"><s>Annie, however, was unaccustomed to such long walks, and besides, recent events had weakened her, and by the time she reached Sefton--for her road lay straight through this little town--she was so hot and thirsty that she looked around her anxiously to find some place of refreshment.</s> </p>

<p pid="1332" id="girls.c0.p1332"><s>In an unconscious manner she paused before a restaurant, where she and several other girls of Lavender House had more than once been regaled with buns and milk.</s> </p>

<p pid="1407" id="girls.c0.p1407"><s>Annie sat up and rubbed her tired eyes.</s> <s>With the sunshine and brightness her versatile spirits revived; she buckled on her courage like an armour, and almost laughed at the miseries of the past few hours.</s> <s>Once more she believed that success and victory would be hers, once more in her small way she was ready to do or die.</s> <s>She believed absolutely in the holiness of her mission.</s> <s>Love--love alone simple and pure, was guiding her.</s> <s>She gave no thought to after-consequences, she gave no memory to past events: her object now was to rescue Nan, and she herself was nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="1415" id="girls.c0.p1415"><s>Annie dreaded the barking of the dogs, although she guessed that if they set up a noise, and a gipsy wife or man put out their heads in consequence, they would only desire the gipsy child to lie down and keep quiet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1416" id="girls.c0.p1416"><s>She stood still for a moment--she was very anxious to prowl around the place and examine the ground while the gipsies still slept, but the watchful dogs deterred her.</s> <s>She stood perfectly quiet behind the hedge-row, thinking hard.</s> <s>Should she trust to a charm she knew she possessed, and venture into the encampment?</s> <s>Annie had almost as great a fascination over dogs and cats as she had over children.</s> <s>As a little child going to visit with her mother at strange houses, the watch-dogs never barked at her; on the contrary, they yielded to the charm which seemed to come from her little fingers as she patted their great heads.</s> <s>Slowly their tails would move backwards and forwards as she petted them, and even the most ferocious would look at her with affection.</s> </p>

<p pid="1417" id="girls.c0.p1417"><s>Annie wondered if the gipsy dogs would now allow her to approach without barking.</s> <s>She felt that the chances were in her favour; she was dressed in gipsy garments, there would be nothing strange in her appearance, and if she could get near one of the dogs she knew that she could exercise the magic of her touch.</s> </p>

<p pid="1418" id="girls.c0.p1418"><s>Her object, then, was to approach one of the tents very, very quietly-- so softly that even the dog's ears should not detect the light footfall.</s> <s>If she could approach close enough to put her hand on the dog's neck all would be well.</s> <s>She pulled off the gipsy maid's rough shoes, hid them in the grass where she could find them again, and came gingerly, step by step, nearer and nearer the principal tent.</s> <s>At its entrance lay a ferocious-looking half-bred bull-dog.</s> <s>Annie possessed that necessary accompaniment to courage--great outward calm; the greater the danger, the more cool and self-possessed did she become.</s> <s>She was within a step or two of the tent when she trod accidentally on a small twig: it cracked, giving her foot a sharp pain, and, very slight as the sound was, causing the bull-dog to awake.</s> <s>He raised his wicked face, saw the figure like his own people, and yet unlike, but a step or two away, and, uttering a low growl, sprang forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="1419" id="girls.c0.p1419" type="speech"><s>In the ordinary course of things this growl would have risen in volume and would have terminated in a volley of barking; but Annie was prepared: she went down on her knees, held out her arms, said, <qs/>"Poor fellow!"<qe/> in her own seductive voice, and the bull-dog fawned at her feet.</s> <s>He licked one of her hands while she patted him gently with the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="1420" id="girls.c0.p1420"><s>"Come, poor fellow," she said then in a gentle tone, and Annie and the dog began to perambulate round the tents.</s> </p>

<p pid="1427" id="girls.c0.p1427"><s>The cause of all this uproar was a body of police, about six in number, who came boldly into the field, and demanded instantly to search the tents.</s> </p>

<p pid="1538" id="girls.c0.p1538"><s>Hester made no answer; just for a brief moment she raised her eyes to Miss Agnes's kind face, then they sought the floor.</s> </p>

<p pid="1539" id="girls.c0.p1539"><s>"The story can be told in a few words, dear," said the little lady.</s> <s>"A work-woman of the name of Williams, whom my sister and I have employed for years, and who lives near Oakley, called on us this morning to apologise for not being able to finish some needlework.</s> <s>She told us that she had a sick child, and also a little girl of three, in her house.</s> <s>She said she had found the child, in ragged gipsy garments, fainting in a field.</s> <s>She took her into her house, and, on undressing her, found that she was no true gipsy, but that her face and hands and arms had been dyed; she said the little one had been treated in a similar manner.</s> <s>Jane's suspicions and mine were instantly roused, and we went back with the woman to Oakley, and round, as we had anticipated, that the children were little Nan and Annie.</s> <s>The sad thing is that Annie is in high fever, and knows no one.</s> <s>We waited there until the doctor arrived, who spoke very, very seriously of her case.</s> <s>Little Nan is well, and asked for you."</s> </p>

<p pid="1540" id="girls.c0.p1540"><s>With these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room, closing the door after her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1542" id="girls.c0.p1542"><s>"Tell me what is wrong, my poor child," said Mr Everard.</s> <s>He laid his hand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the agitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and of her deep, though until now unavailing repentance.</s> <s>How from the first she had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her; how she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the clew was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had determined not to use it.</s> </p>

<p pid="1543" id="girls.c0.p1543" type="speech"><s>"From the day Nan was lost," continued Hester, <qs/>"it has been all agony and all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell!</s> <s>I was too proud to humble myself to the very dust!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1548" id="girls.c0.p1548" type="speech"><s>"No, Hester," answered Mr Everard, <qs/>"you want more than that--you want far more than that.</s> <s>It may be that God will take Annie Forest away.</s> <s>We cannot tell.</s> <s>With Him alone are the issues of life or death.</s> <s>What you really want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have wronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven."<qe/></s> <s>Hester began to sob wildly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1549" id="girls.c0.p1549"><s>"If--if she dies--may I see her first?" she gasped.</s> </p>

<p pid="1551" id="girls.c0.p1551"><s>Mr Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out.</s> </p>

<p pid="1552" id="girls.c0.p1552" type="speech"><s>"Meet me in the chapel to-night," he whispered low in her car, <qs/>"I will talk with you and pray with you there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1554" id="girls.c0.p1554"><s>All throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester; but the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very righteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned heavily against the table.</s> </p>

<p pid="1555" id="girls.c0.p1555"><s>"This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss Drummond?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1557" id="girls.c0.p1557"><s>"I must insist on your telling me the exact story of your sin.</s> <s>There is no use in your attempting to deny anything; only the utmost candour on your part can now save you from being publicly expelled."</s> </p>

<p pid="1558" id="girls.c0.p1558"><s>"I am willing to tell," answered Susan.</s> <s>"I meant no harm; it was done as a bit of fun.</s> <s>I had a cousin at home who was very clever at drawing caricatures, and I happened to have nothing to do one day, and I was alone in Annie's bedroom, and I thought I'd like to see what she kept in her desk.</s> <s>I always had a fancy for collecting odd keys, and I found one on my bunch which fitted her desk exactly.</s> <s>I opened it, and I found such a smart little caricature of Mrs Willis.</s> <s>I sent the caricature to my cousin, and begged of her to make an exact copy of it.</s> <s>She did so, and I put Annie's back in her desk, and pasted the other into Cecil's book.</s> <s>I didn't like Dora Russell, and I wrapped up the sweeties in her theme; but I did the other for pure fun, for I knew Cecil would be so shocked; but I never guessed the blame would fall on Annie.</s> <s>When I found it did, I felt inclined to tell once or twice, but it seemed too much trouble, and, besides, I knew Mrs Willis would punish me, and, of course, I didn't wish that.</s> </p>

<p pid="1559" id="girls.c0.p1559"><s>"Dora Russell was always very nasty to me, and when I found she was putting on such airs, and pretending she could write such a grand essay for the prize, I thought I'd take down her pride a bit.</s> <s>I went to her desk, and I got some of the rough copy of the thing she was calling `The River,' and I sent it off to my cousin, and my cousin made up such a ridiculous paper, and she hit off Dora's writing to the life, and, of course, I had to put it into Dora's desk and tear up her real copy.</s> <s>It was very unlucky Hester being in the room.</s> <s>Of course I never guessed that, or I wouldn't have gone.</s> <s>That was the night we all went with Annie to the fairies' field.</s> <s>I never meant to get Hester into a scrape, nor Annie either, for that matter; but, of course, I couldn't be expected to tell on myself."</s> </p>

<p pid="1560" id="girls.c0.p1560"><s>Susan related her story in her usual monotonous and singsong voice.</s> <s>There was no trace of apparent emotion on her face, or of regret in her tones.</s> <s>When she had finished speaking Mr Everard was absolutely silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="1561" id="girls.c0.p1561"><s>"I took a great deal of trouble," continued Susan, after a pause, in a slightly fretful key.</s> <s>"It was really nothing but a joke, and I don't see why such a fuss should have been made.</s> <s>I know I lost a great deal of sleep trying to manage that twine business round my foot.</s> <s>I don't think I shall trouble myself playing any more tricks upon school-girls-- they are not worth it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1562" id="girls.c0.p1562"><s>"You'll never play any more tricks on these girls," said Mr Everard, rising to his feet, and suddenly filling the room and reducing Susan to an abject silence by the ring of his stern, deep voice.</s> <s>"I take it upon me, in the absence of your mistress, to pronounce your punishment.</s> <s>You leave Lavender House in disgrace this evening.</s> <s>Miss Good will take you home, and explain to your parents the cause of your dismissal.</s> <s>You are not to see _any_ of your school-fellows again.</s> <s>Your meanness, your cowardice, your sin require no words on my part to deepen their vileness.</s> <s>Through pure wantonness you have cast a cruel shadow on an innocent young life.</s> <s>If that girl dies, you indeed are not blameless in the cause of her early removal, for through you her heart and spirit were broken.</s> <s>Miss Drummond, I pray God you may at least repent and be sorry.</s> <s>There are some people mentioned in the Bible who are spoken of as past feeling.</s> <s>Wretched girl, while there is yet time, pray that you may not belong to them.</s> <s>Now I must leave you, but I shall lock you in.</s> <s>Miss Good will come for you in about an hour to take you away."</s> </p>

<p pid="1563" id="girls.c0.p1563"><s>Susan Drummond sank down on the nearest seat, and began to cry softly; one or two pin-pricks from Mr Everard's stern words may possibly have reached her shallow heart--no one can tell.</s> <s>She left Lavender House that evening, and none of the girls who had lived with her as their school-mate heard of her again.</s> </p>

<p pid="1564" id="girls.c0.p1564"><s>CHAPTER FIFTY.</s> <s>THE HEART OF LITTLE NAN.</s> </p>

<p pid="1565" id="girls.c0.p1565"><s>For several days now Annie had lain unconscious in Mrs Williams's little bedroom; the kind-hearted woman could not find it in her heart to send the sick child away.</s> <s>Her husband and the neighbours expostulated with her, and said that Annie was only a poor little waif.</s> </p>

<p pid="1566" id="girls.c0.p1566"><s>"She has no call on you," said Jane Allen, a hard-featured woman who lived next door.</s> <s>"Why should you put yourself out just for a sick lass? and she'll be much better on in the workhouse infirmary."</s> </p>

<p pid="1567" id="girls.c0.p1567"><s>But Mrs Williams shook her head at her hard-featured and hard-hearted neighbour, and resisted her husband's entreaties.</s> </p>

<p pid="1568" id="girls.c0.p1568" type="speech"><s>"Eh!" she said, <qs/>"but the poor lamb needs a good bit of mothering, and I misdoubt me she wouldn't get much of that in the infirmary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1569" id="girls.c0.p1569"><s>So Annie stayed, and tossed from side to side of her little bed, and murmured unintelligible words, and grew daily a little weaker and a little more delirious.</s> <s>The parish doctor called, and shook his head over her: he was not a particularly clever man, but he was the best the Williamses could afford.</s> <s>While Annie suffered and went deeper into that valley of humiliation and weakness which leads to the gate of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, little Nan played with Peggy Williams, and accustomed herself after the fashion of little children to all the ways of her new and humble home.</s> </p>

<p pid="1570" id="girls.c0.p1570"><s>It was on the eighth day of Annie's fever that the Misses Bruce discovered her, and on the evening of that day Mrs Willis knelt by her little favourite's bed.</s> <s>A better doctor had been called in, and all that money could procure had been got now for poor Annie; but the second doctor considered her case even more critical, and said that the close air of the cottage was much against her recovery.</s> </p>

<p pid="1571" id="girls.c0.p1571"><s>"I didn't make that caricature; I took the girls into the fairies' field, but I never pasted that caricature into Cecil's book.</s> <s>I know you don't believe me, Cecil; but do you think I would really do anything so mean about one whom I love?</s> <s>No, no!</s> <s>I am innocent!</s> <s>God knows it.</s> <s>Yes, I am glad of that--God knows it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1572" id="girls.c0.p1572" type="speech"><s>Over, and over in Mrs Willis's presence these piteous words would come from the fever-stricken child, but always when she came to the little sentence <qs/>"God knows I am innocent,"<qe/> her voice would grow tranquil, and a faint and sweet smile would play round her lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="1573" id="girls.c0.p1573"><s>Late that night a carriage drew up at a little distance from the cottage, and a moment or two afterwards Mrs Willis was called out of the room to speak to Cecil Temple.</s> </p>

<p pid="1617" id="girls.c0.p1617"><s>"Mr Everard, this gentleman is Annie's father."</s> </p>

<p pid="1618" id="girls.c0.p1618"><s>Mr Everard looked pityingly at Captain Forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="1620" id="girls.c0.p1620"><s>Captain Forest went first into the sick-room; Hester waited outside.</s> <s>She had the little kitchen to herself, for all the Williamses, with the exception of the good mother, had moved for the time being to other quarters.</s> <s>Surely Mr Everard would come for her in a moment?</s> <s>Surely Captain Forest, who had gone into the sick-room with Nan in his arms, would quickly return?</s> <s>There was no sound.</s> <s>All was absolute quiet.</s> <s>How soon would Hester be summoned?</s> <s>Could she--could she bear to look at Annie's dying face?</s> <s>Her agony drove her down on her knees.</s> </p>

<p pid="1621" id="girls.c0.p1621"><s>"Oh, if you would only spare Annie!" she prayed to God.</s> <s>Then she wiped her eyes.</s> <s>This terrible suspense seemed more than she could bear.</s> <s>Suddenly the bedroom door was softly and silently opened, and Mr Everard came out.</s> </p>

<p pid="1626" id="girls.c0.p1626"><s>Annie did not die.</s> <s>The fever passed away in that long and refreshing sleep, while Nan's cool hand lay against her cheek.</s> <s>She came slowly, slowly back to life--to a fresh, a new, and a glad life.</s> <s>Hester, from being her enemy, was now her dearest and warmest friend.</s> <s>Her father was at home again, and she could no longer think or speak of herself as lonely or sad.</s> <s>She recovered, and in future days reigned as a greater favourite than ever at Lavender House.</s> <s>It is only fair to say that Tiger never went back to the gipsies, but devoted himself first and foremost to Annie, and then to the Captain, who pronounced him a capital dog, and when he heard his story vowed he never would part with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="1627" id="girls.c0.p1627"><s>Owing to Annie's illness, and to all the trouble and confusion which immediately ensued, Mrs Willis did not give away her prizes at the usual time; but when her scholars once more assembled at Lavender House she astonished several of them by a few words.</s> </p>

<p pid="1628" id="girls.c0.p1628" type="speech"><s>"My dears," she said, standing in her accustomed place at the head of the long school-room, <qs/>"I intend now, before our first day of lessons begins, to distribute those prizes which would have been yours, under ordinary circumstances, on the twenty-first of June.</s> <s>The prizes will be distributed during the afternoon recess: but here, and now, I wish to say something about--and also to give away--the prize for English composition.</s> <s>Six essays, all written with more or less care, have been given to me to inspect.</s> <s>There are reasons which we need not now go into which made it impossible to me to say anything in favour of a theme called `The River,' written by my late pupil, Miss Russell: but I can cordially praise a very nice historical sketch of Marie Antoinette, the work of Hester Thornton.</s> <s>Mary Price has also written a study which pleases me much, as it shows thought and even a little originality.</s> <s>The remainder of the six essays simply reach an ordinary average.</s> <s>You will be surprised therefore, my dears, to learn that I do not award the prize to any of these themes, but rather to a seventh composition, which was put into my hands yesterday by Miss Danesbury.</s> <s>It is crude and unfinished, and doubtless but for her recent illness would have received many corrections: but these few pages, which are called `A Lonely Child,' drew tears from my eyes; crude as they are, they have the merit of real originality.</s> <s>They are too morbid to read to you, girls, and I sincerely trust and pray the young writer may never pen anything so sad again.</s> <s>Such as they are, however, they rank first in the order of merit, and the prize is hers.</s> <s>Annie, my dear, come forward."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1629" id="girls.c0.p1629"><s>Annie left her seat, and, amid the cheers of her companions, went up to Mrs Willis, who placed a locket, attached to a slender gold chain, round her neck; the locket contained a miniature of the head-mistress's much-loved face.</s> </p>
