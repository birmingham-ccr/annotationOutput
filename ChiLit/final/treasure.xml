<qe/><title>PART 1. The Old Buccaneer CHAPTER 1. The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow</title>
<p pid="1" id="treasure.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="treasure.c1.s1">SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="treasure.c1.s2">I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white.</s> <s sid="3" id="treasure.c1.s3">I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="treasure.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="treasure.c1.s4"><qs/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="treasure.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="treasure.c1.s5">in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars.</s> <s sid="6" id="treasure.c1.s6">Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum.</s> <s sid="7" id="treasure.c1.s7">This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="treasure.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="treasure.c1.s8"><qs/>"This is a handy cove,"<qe/><sss/> says he at length; <sse/><qs/>"and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop.</s> <s sid="9" id="treasure.c1.s9">Much company, mate?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="treasure.c1.p6"><s sid="10" id="treasure.c1.s10">My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="treasure.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="treasure.c1.s11"><qs/>"Well, then,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"this is the berth for me.</s> <s sid="12" id="treasure.c1.s12">Here you, matey,"<qe/><sls/> he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; <sle/><qs/>"bring up alongside and help up my chest.</s> <s sid="13" id="treasure.c1.s13">I'll stay here a bit,"<qe/> he continued.</s> <s sid="14" id="treasure.c1.s14">"I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off.</s> <s sid="15" id="treasure.c1.s15">What you mought call me?</s> <s sid="16" id="treasure.c1.s16">You mought call me captain.</s> <s sid="17" id="treasure.c1.s17">Oh, I see what you're at--there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold.</s> <s sid="18" id="treasure.c1.s18"><qs/>"You can tell me when I've worked through that,"<qe/> says he, looking as fierce as a commander.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="treasure.c1.p8"><s sid="19" id="treasure.c1.s19">And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike.</s> <s sid="20" id="treasure.c1.s20">The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence.</s> <s sid="21" id="treasure.c1.s21">And that was all we could learn of our guest.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="treasure.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="treasure.c1.s22">He was a very silent man by custom.</s> <s sid="23" id="treasure.c1.s23">All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong.</s> <s sid="24" id="treasure.c1.s24">Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be.</s> <s sid="25" id="treasure.c1.s25">Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road.</s> <s sid="26" id="treasure.c1.s26">At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them.</s> <s sid="27" id="treasure.c1.s27">When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present.</s> <s sid="28" id="treasure.c1.s28">For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms.</s> <s sid="29" id="treasure.c1.s29">He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg" and let him know the moment he appeared.</s> <s sid="30" id="treasure.c1.s30">Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for <qs/>"the seafaring man with one leg."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="treasure.c1.p10"><s sid="31" id="treasure.c1.s31">How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you.</s> <s sid="32" id="treasure.c1.s32">On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions.</s> <s sid="33" id="treasure.c1.s33">Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body.</s> <s sid="34" id="treasure.c1.s34">To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares.</s> <s sid="35" id="treasure.c1.s35">And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="treasure.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="treasure.c1.s36">But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him.</s> <s sid="37" id="treasure.c1.s37">There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing.</s> <s sid="38" id="treasure.c1.s38">Often I have heard the house shaking with <qs/>"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,"<qe/> all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark.</s> <s sid="39" id="treasure.c1.s39">For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story.</s> <s sid="40" id="treasure.c1.s40">Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="treasure.c1.p12"><s sid="41" id="treasure.c1.s41">His stories were what frightened people worst of all.</s> <s sid="42" id="treasure.c1.s42">Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main.</s> <s sid="43" id="treasure.c1.s43">By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described.</s> <s sid="44" id="treasure.c1.s44">My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good.</s> <s sid="45" id="treasure.c1.s45">People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a "true sea-dog" and a "real old salt" and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="treasure.c1.p13"><s sid="46" id="treasure.c1.s46">In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more.</s> <s sid="47" id="treasure.c1.s47">If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room.</s> <s sid="48" id="treasure.c1.s48">I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="treasure.c1.p14"><s sid="49" id="treasure.c1.s49">All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker.</s> <s sid="50" id="treasure.c1.s50">One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew.</s> <s sid="51" id="treasure.c1.s51">I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches.</s> <s sid="52" id="treasure.c1.s52">He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum.</s> <s sid="53" id="treasure.c1.s53">The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="treasure.c1.p15"><s sid="54" id="treasure.c1.s54">He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off.</s> <s sid="55" id="treasure.c1.s55">Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow.</s> <s sid="56" id="treasure.c1.s56">I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in rum, with his arms on the table.</s> <s sid="57" id="treasure.c1.s57">Suddenly he--the captain, that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="treasure.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="treasure.c1.s58"><qs/>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!</s> <s sid="59" id="treasure.c1.s59">Drink and the devil had done for the rest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="treasure.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="treasure.c1.s60">At first I had supposed "the dead man's chest" to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man.</s> <s sid="61" id="treasure.c1.s61">But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics.</s> <s sid="62" id="treasure.c1.s62">In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence.</s> <s sid="63" id="treasure.c1.s63">The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two.</s> <s sid="64" id="treasure.c1.s64">The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath, <qs/>"Silence, there, between decks!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="treasure.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="treasure.c1.s65"><qs/>"Were you addressing me, sir?"<qe/><sls/> says the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, <sle/><qs/>"I have only one thing to say to you, sir,"<qe/><sss/> replies the doctor, <sse/><qs/>"that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="treasure.c1.p19"><s sid="66" id="treasure.c1.s66">The old fellow's fury was awful.</s> <s sid="67" id="treasure.c1.s67">He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="treasure.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="treasure.c1.s68">The doctor never so much as moved.</s> <s sid="69" id="treasure.c1.s69">He spoke to him as before, over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady:</s> <s sid="70" id="treasure.c1.s70"><qs/>"If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="treasure.c1.p21"><s sid="71" id="treasure.c1.s71">Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="treasure.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="treasure.c1.s72"><qs/>"And now, sir,"<qe/><sss/> continued the doctor, <sse/><qs/>"since I now know there's such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and night.</s> <s sid="73" id="treasure.c1.s73">I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this.</s> <s sid="74" id="treasure.c1.s74">Let that suffice."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="treasure.c1.p23"><s sid="75" id="treasure.c1.s75">Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="treasure.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="treasure.c2.s1">IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs.</s> <s sid="2" id="treasure.c2.s2">It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring.</s> <s sid="3" id="treasure.c2.s3">He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="treasure.c2.s4">It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward.</s> <s sid="5" id="treasure.c2.s5">The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head.</s> <s sid="6" id="treasure.c2.s6">I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="treasure.c2.p3"><s sid="7" id="treasure.c2.s7">Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before.</s> <s sid="8" id="treasure.c2.s8">He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter.</s> <s sid="9" id="treasure.c2.s9">I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me.</s> <s sid="10" id="treasure.c2.s10">He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="treasure.c2.p4"><s sid="11" id="treasure.c2.s11">I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near.</s> <s sid="12" id="treasure.c2.s12">I paused where I was, with my napkin in my hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c4.p2"><s sid="9" id="treasure.c4.s9">The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned.</s> <s sid="10" id="treasure.c4.s10">We were not many minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken.</s> <s sid="11" id="treasure.c4.s11">But there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="treasure.c4.p20"><s sid="59" id="treasure.c4.s59">It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries and sizes--doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random.</s> <s sid="60" id="treasure.c4.s60">The guineas, too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="treasure.c4.p21"><s sid="61" id="treasure.c4.s61">When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the frozen road.</s> <s sid="62" id="treasure.c4.s62">It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.</s> <s sid="63" id="treasure.c4.s63">Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without.</s> <s sid="64" id="treasure.c4.s64">At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c13.p2"><s sid="2" id="treasure.c13.s2">I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows.</s> <s sid="3" id="treasure.c13.s3">On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="treasure.c13.p4"><s sid="9" id="treasure.c13.s9">Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch.</s> <s sid="10" id="treasure.c13.s10">The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage.</s> <s sid="11" id="treasure.c13.s11">The marsh was steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="treasure.c15.p3"><s sid="11" id="treasure.c15.s11">Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="treasure.c16.p34" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="treasure.c16.s68"><qs/>"Ready!"<qe/> cried the squire.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="treasure.c16.p35" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="treasure.c16.s69"><qs/>"Hold!"<qe/> cried the captain, quick as an echo.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="treasure.c16.p37"><s sid="74" id="treasure.c16.s74">At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.</s> <s sid="75" id="treasure.c16.s75">The other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and bubbling.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="treasure.c16.p38"><s sid="76" id="treasure.c16.s76">So far there was no great harm.</s> <s sid="77" id="treasure.c16.s77">No lives were lost, and we could wade ashore in safety.</s> <s sid="78" id="treasure.c16.s78">But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for service.</s> <s sid="79" id="treasure.c16.s79">Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by a sort of instinct.</s> <s sid="80" id="treasure.c16.s80">As for the captain, he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost.</s> <s sid="81" id="treasure.c16.s81">The other three had gone down with the boat.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="treasure.c16.p39"><s sid="82" id="treasure.c16.s82">To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm.</s> <s sid="83" id="treasure.c16.s83">Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush one's clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="treasure.c16.p40"><s sid="84" id="treasure.c16.s84">With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="treasure.c21.p31"><s sid="67" id="treasure.c21.s67">The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in, with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the surface.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="treasure.c25.p11"><s sid="35" id="treasure.c25.s35">With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion.</s> <s sid="36" id="treasure.c25.s36">I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="treasure.c25.p12"><s sid="37" id="treasure.c25.s37">He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck.</s> <s sid="38" id="treasure.c25.s38">In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood.</s> <s sid="39" id="treasure.c25.s39">He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="treasure.c25.p13"><s sid="40" id="treasure.c25.s40">This was all that I required to know.</s> <s sid="41" id="treasure.c25.s41">Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim.</s> <s sid="42" id="treasure.c25.s42">What he would do afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was, of course, more than I could say.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="treasure.c25.p14"><s sid="43" id="treasure.c25.s43">Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of the schooner.</s> <s sid="44" id="treasure.c25.s44">We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="treasure.c25.p15"><s sid="45" id="treasure.c25.s45">While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body.</s> <s sid="46" id="treasure.c25.s46">I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="treasure.c25.p16" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="treasure.c25.s47">Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light.</s> <s sid="48" id="treasure.c25.s48">He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his favourite toast of <qs/>"Here's luck!"<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="treasure.c25.s49">Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="treasure.c25.p17" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="treasure.c25.s50"><qs/>"Cut me a junk o' that,"<qe/><sss/> says he, <sse/><qs/>"for I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had.</s> <s sid="51" id="treasure.c25.s51">Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays!</s> <s sid="52" id="treasure.c25.s52">Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my long home, and no mistake."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="treasure.c25.p18" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="treasure.c25.s53"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="treasure.c25.p19" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="treasure.c25.s54"><qs/>"Why?"<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="55" id="treasure.c25.s55"><qs/>"Now, you tell me why."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="treasure.c25.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="treasure.c25.s56"><qs/>"Why?"<qe/></s> <s sid="57" id="treasure.c25.s57">I cried.</s> <s sid="58" id="treasure.c25.s58"><qs/>"You were asking me just now about the dead.</s> <s sid="59" id="treasure.c25.s59">You've broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why!</s> <s sid="60" id="treasure.c25.s60">For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="treasure.c25.p21"><s sid="61" id="treasure.c25.s61">I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with.</s> <s sid="62" id="treasure.c25.s62">He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="treasure.c25.p22" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="treasure.c25.s63"><qs/>"For thirty years,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"I've sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not.</s> <s sid="64" id="treasure.c25.s64">Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come o' goodness yet.</s> <s sid="65" id="treasure.c25.s65">Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite; them's my views--amen, so be it.</s> <s sid="66" id="treasure.c25.s66">And now, you look here,"<qe/><sls/> he added, suddenly changing his tone, <sle/><qs/>"we've had about enough of this foolery.</s> <s sid="67" id="treasure.c25.s67">The tide's made good enough by now.</s> <s sid="68" id="treasure.c25.s68">You just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins, and we'll sail slap in and be done with it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="treasure.c25.p23"><s sid="69" id="treasure.c25.s69">All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in.</s> <s sid="70" id="treasure.c25.s70">I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="treasure.c25.p24"><s sid="71" id="treasure.c25.s71">Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us.</s> <s sid="72" id="treasure.c25.s72">The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river.</s> <s sid="73" id="treasure.c25.s73">Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation.</s> <s sid="74" id="treasure.c25.s74">It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers.</s> <s sid="75" id="treasure.c25.s75">It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the anchorage was calm.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="treasure.c25.p25" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="treasure.c25.s76"><qs/>"Now,"<qe/><sss/> said Hands, <sse/><qs/>"look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship in.</s> <s sid="77" id="treasure.c25.s77">Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="treasure.c25.p26" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="treasure.c25.s78"><qs/>"And once beached,"<qe/><sss/> I inquired, <sse/><qs/>"how shall we get her off again?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="treasure.c25.p27" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="treasure.c25.s79"><qs/>"Why, so,"<qe/> he replied:</s> <s sid="80" id="treasure.c25.s80"><qs/>"you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide.</s> <s sid="81" id="treasure.c25.s81">Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur'.</s> <s sid="82" id="treasure.c25.s82">And now, boy, you stand by.</s> <s sid="83" id="treasure.c25.s83">We're near the bit now, and she's too much way on her.</s> <s sid="84" id="treasure.c25.s84">Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard a little--steady--steady!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="treasure.c25.p28" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="treasure.c25.s85">So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a sudden, he cried, <qs/>"Now, my hearty, luff!"<qe/></s> <s sid="86" id="treasure.c25.s86">And I put the helm hard up, and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low, wooded shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="treasure.c25.p29"><s sid="87" id="treasure.c25.s87">The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain.</s> <s sid="88" id="treasure.c25.s88">Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows.</s> <s sid="89" id="treasure.c25.s89">I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head.</s> <s sid="90" id="treasure.c25.s90">Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked round, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in his right hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="treasure.c25.p30"><s sid="91" id="treasure.c25.s91">We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging bully's.</s> <s sid="92" id="treasure.c25.s92">At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows.</s> <s sid="93" id="treasure.c25.s93">As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="treasure.c25.p31"><s sid="94" id="treasure.c25.s94">Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped, with all the deck to dodge about.</s> <s sid="95" id="treasure.c25.s95">Just forward of the main-mast I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the trigger.</s> <s sid="96" id="treasure.c25.s96">The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound; the priming was useless with sea-water.</s> <s sid="97" id="treasure.c25.s97">I cursed myself for my neglect.</s> <s sid="98" id="treasure.c25.s98">Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons?</s> <s sid="99" id="treasure.c25.s99">Then I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="treasure.c25.p32"><s sid="100" id="treasure.c25.s100">Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury.</s> <s sid="101" id="treasure.c25.s101">I had no time to try my other pistol, nor indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless.</s> <s sid="102" id="treasure.c25.s102">One thing I saw plainly:</s> <s sid="103" id="treasure.c25.s103">I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern.</s> <s sid="104" id="treasure.c25.s104">Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.</s> <s sid="105" id="treasure.c25.s105">I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="treasure.c25.p33"><s sid="106" id="treasure.c25.s106">Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine.</s> <s sid="107" id="treasure.c25.s107">It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove, but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as now.</s> <s sid="108" id="treasure.c25.s108">Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh.</s> <s sid="109" id="treasure.c25.s109">Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any ultimate escape.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="treasure.c25.p34"><s sid="110" id="treasure.c25.s110">Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck, staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="treasure.c25.p35"><s sid="111" id="treasure.c25.s111">We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us.</s> <s sid="112" id="treasure.c25.s112">So near were we, indeed, that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle.</s> <s sid="113" id="treasure.c25.s113">Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body.</s> <s sid="114" id="treasure.c25.s114">The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me.</s> <s sid="115" id="treasure.c25.s115">Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="treasure.c25.p36"><s sid="116" id="treasure.c25.s116">I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="treasure.c25.p37"><s sid="117" id="treasure.c25.s117">Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="treasure.c25.p38"><s sid="118" id="treasure.c25.s118">My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount.</s> <s sid="119" id="treasure.c25.s119">It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up.</s> <s sid="120" id="treasure.c25.s120">Then, with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="treasure.c25.p39" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="treasure.c25.s121"><qs/>"One more step, Mr. Hands,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"and I'll blow your brains out!</s> <s sid="122" id="treasure.c25.s122">Dead men don't bite, you know,"<qe/> I added with a chuckle.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="treasure.c25.p40"><s sid="123" id="treasure.c25.s123">He stopped instantly.</s> <s sid="124" id="treasure.c25.s124">I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my new-found security, I laughed aloud.</s> <s sid="125" id="treasure.c25.s125">At last, with a swallow or two, he spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.</s> <s sid="126" id="treasure.c25.s126">In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all else he remained unmoved.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="treasure.c25.p41" type="speech"><s sid="127" id="treasure.c25.s127"><qs/>"Jim,"<qe/><sss/> says he, <sse/><qs/>"I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll have to sign articles.</s> <s sid="128" id="treasure.c25.s128">I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don't have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="treasure.c25.p42"><s sid="129" id="treasure.c25.s129">I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his shoulder.</s> <s sid="130" id="treasure.c25.s130">Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast.</s> <s sid="131" id="treasure.c25.s131">In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands.</s> <s sid="132" id="treasure.c25.s132">They did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c26.p2"><s sid="8" id="treasure.c26.s8">I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick, faint, and terrified.</s> <s sid="9" id="treasure.c26.s9">The hot blood was running over my back and chest.</s> <s sid="10" id="treasure.c26.s10">The dirk, where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot iron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me, for these, it seemed to me, I could bear without a murmur; it was the horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="treasure.c26.p3"><s sid="11" id="treasure.c26.s11">I clung with both hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril.</s> <s sid="12" id="treasure.c26.s12">Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in possession of myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="treasure.c26.p4"><s sid="13" id="treasure.c26.s13">It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me, and I desisted with a violent shudder.</s> <s sid="14" id="treasure.c26.s14">Oddly enough, that very shudder did the business.</s> <s sid="15" id="treasure.c26.s15">The knife, in fact, had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away.</s> <s sid="16" id="treasure.c26.s16">The blood ran down the faster, to be sure, but I was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="treasure.c26.p5"><s sid="17" id="treasure.c26.s17">These last I broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds.</s> <s sid="18" id="treasure.c26.s18">For nothing in the world would I have again ventured, shaken as I was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from which Israel had so lately fallen.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="treasure.c26.p6"><s sid="19" id="treasure.c26.s19">I went below and did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm.</s> <s sid="20" id="treasure.c26.s20">Then I looked around me, and as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I began to think of clearing it from its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="treasure.c26.p7"><s sid="21" id="treasure.c26.s21">He had pitched, as I have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how different from life's colour or life's comeliness!</s> <s sid="22" id="treasure.c26.s22">In that position I could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave, tumbled him overboard.</s> <s sid="23" id="treasure.c26.s23">He went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash subsided, I could see him and Israel lying side by side, both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water.</s> <s sid="24" id="treasure.c26.s24">O'Brien, though still quite a young man, was very bald.</s> <s sid="25" id="treasure.c26.s25">There he lay, with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="treasure.c26.p8"><s sid="26" id="treasure.c26.s26">I was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned.</s> <s sid="27" id="treasure.c26.s27">The sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck.</s> <s sid="28" id="treasure.c26.s28">The evening breeze had sprung up, and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="treasure.c26.p9"><s sid="29" id="treasure.c26.s29">I began to see a danger to the ship.</s> <s sid="30" id="treasure.c26.s30">The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter.</s> <s sid="31" id="treasure.c26.s31">Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water.</s> <s sid="32" id="treasure.c26.s32">I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle.</s> <s sid="33" id="treasure.c26.s33">At last I got my knife and cut the halyards.</s> <s sid="34" id="treasure.c26.s34">The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of what I could accomplish.</s> <s sid="35" id="treasure.c26.s35">For the rest, the HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="treasure.c26.p10"><s sid="36" id="treasure.c26.s36">By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays, I remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck.</s> <s sid="37" id="treasure.c26.s37">It began to be chill; the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more on her beam-ends.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="treasure.c26.p11"><s sid="38" id="treasure.c26.s38">I scrambled forward and looked over.</s> <s sid="39" id="treasure.c26.s39">It seemed shallow enough, and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, I let myself drop softly overboard.</s> <s sid="40" id="treasure.c26.s40">The water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks, and I waded ashore in great spirits, leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay.</s> <s sid="41" id="treasure.c26.s41">About the same time, the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="treasure.c26.p12"><s sid="42" id="treasure.c26.s42">At least, and at last, I was off the sea, nor had I returned thence empty-handed.</s> <s sid="43" id="treasure.c26.s43">There lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again.</s> <s sid="44" id="treasure.c26.s44">I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements.</s> <s sid="45" id="treasure.c26.s45">Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer, and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="treasure.c26.p13"><s sid="46" id="treasure.c26.s46">So thinking, and in famous spirits, I began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions.</s> <s sid="47" id="treasure.c26.s47">I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidd's anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left, and I bent my course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was small.</s> <s sid="48" id="treasure.c26.s48">The wood was pretty open, and keeping along the lower spurs, I had soon turned the corner of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the watercourse.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="treasure.c26.p14"><s sid="49" id="treasure.c26.s49">This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn, the maroon; and I walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side.</s> <s sid="50" id="treasure.c26.s50">The dusk had come nigh hand completely, and as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks, I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as I judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire.</s> <s sid="51" id="treasure.c26.s51">And yet I wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so careless.</s> <s sid="52" id="treasure.c26.s52">For if I could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="treasure.c26.p15"><s sid="53" id="treasure.c26.s53">Gradually the night fell blacker; it was all I could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few and pale; and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="treasure.c26.p16"><s sid="54" id="treasure.c26.s54">Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me.</s> <s sid="55" id="treasure.c26.s55">I looked up; a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass, and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and knew the moon had risen.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="treasure.c26.p17"><s sid="56" id="treasure.c26.s56">With this to help me, I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near to the stockade.</s> <s sid="57" id="treasure.c26.s57">Yet, as I began to thread the grove that lies before it, I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a trifle warily.</s> <s sid="58" id="treasure.c26.s58">It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="treasure.c26.p18"><s sid="59" id="treasure.c26.s59">The moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees.</s> <s sid="60" id="treasure.c26.s60">It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="treasure.c26.p19"><s sid="61" id="treasure.c26.s61">For the life of me I could not think what it might be.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="treasure.c26.p20"><s sid="62" id="treasure.c26.s62">At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing.</s> <s sid="63" id="treasure.c26.s63">The western end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light.</s> <s sid="64" id="treasure.c26.s64">On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation, contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon.</s> <s sid="65" id="treasure.c26.s65">There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="treasure.c26.p21"><s sid="66" id="treasure.c26.s66">I stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror also.</s> <s sid="67" id="treasure.c26.s67">It had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed, by the captain's orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="treasure.c26.p22"><s sid="68" id="treasure.c26.s68">I stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="treasure.c26.p23" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="treasure.c26.s69">To make assurance surer, I got upon my hands and knees and crawled, without a sound, towards the corner of the house.</s> <s sid="70" id="treasure.c26.s70">As I drew nearer, my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened.</s> <s sid="71" id="treasure.c26.s71">It is not a pleasant noise in itself, and I have often complained of it at other times, but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep.</s> <s sid="72" id="treasure.c26.s72">The sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful <qs/>"All's well,"<qe/> never fell more reassuringly on my ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="treasure.c26.p24"><s sid="73" id="treasure.c26.s73">In the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous bad watch.</s> <s sid="74" id="treasure.c26.s74">If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak.</s> <s sid="75" id="treasure.c26.s75">That was what it was, thought I, to have the captain wounded; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="treasure.c26.p25"><s sid="76" id="treasure.c26.s76">By this time I had got to the door and stood up.</s> <s sid="77" id="treasure.c26.s77">All was dark within, so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye.</s> <s sid="78" id="treasure.c26.s78">As for sounds, there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="treasure.c26.p26"><s sid="79" id="treasure.c26.s79">With my arms before me I walked steadily in.</s> <s sid="80" id="treasure.c26.s80">I should lie down in my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="treasure.c26.p27"><s sid="81" id="treasure.c26.s81">My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned and groaned, but without awaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="treasure.c26.p28"><s sid="82" id="treasure.c26.s82">And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness:</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="treasure.c26.p29" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="treasure.c26.s83"><qs/>"Pieces of eight!</s> <s sid="84" id="treasure.c26.s84">Pieces of eight!</s> <s sid="85" id="treasure.c26.s85">Pieces of eight!</s> <s sid="86" id="treasure.c26.s86">Pieces of eight!</s> <s sid="87" id="treasure.c26.s87">Pieces of eight!"<qe/> and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="treasure.c26.p30"><s sid="88" id="treasure.c26.s88">Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint!</s> <s sid="89" id="treasure.c26.s89">It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="treasure.c26.p31" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="treasure.c26.s90">I had no time left me to recover.</s> <s sid="91" id="treasure.c26.s91">At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, <qs/>"Who goes?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="treasure.c26.p32"><s sid="92" id="treasure.c26.s92">I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="treasure.c26.p33" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="treasure.c26.s93"><qs/>"Bring a torch, Dick,"<qe/> said Silver when my capture was thus assured.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="treasure.c26.p34"><s sid="94" id="treasure.c26.s94">And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="treasure.c33.p1"><s sid="1" id="treasure.c33.s1">THE next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three miles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen.</s> <s sid="2" id="treasure.c33.s2">The three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought, besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="treasure.c33.p2"><s sid="3" id="treasure.c33.s3">Therefore the work was pushed on briskly.</s> <s sid="4" id="treasure.c33.s4">Gray and Ben Gunn came and went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach.</s> <s sid="5" id="treasure.c33.s5">Two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with.</s> <s sid="6" id="treasure.c33.s6">For my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread-bags.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="treasure.c33.p3"><s sid="7" id="treasure.c33.s7">It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the diversity of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them.</s> <s sid="8" id="treasure.c33.s8">English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="treasure.c33.p4"><s sid="9" id="treasure.c33.s9">Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="treasure.c33.p5"><s sid="10" id="treasure.c33.s10">At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing.</s> <s sid="11" id="treasure.c33.s11">It was only a snatch that reached our ears, followed by the former silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="treasure.c33.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="treasure.c33.s12"><qs/>"Heaven forgive them,"<qe/><sss/> said the doctor; <sse/><qs/>"'tis the mutineers!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="treasure.c33.p8"><s sid="14" id="treasure.c33.s14">Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent.</s> <s sid="15" id="treasure.c33.s15">Indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all.</s> <s sid="16" id="treasure.c33.s16">Yet, I think, none treated him better than a dog, unless it was Ben Gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for; although for that matter, I suppose, I had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else, for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau.</s> <s sid="17" id="treasure.c33.s17">Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="treasure.c33.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="treasure.c33.s18"><qs/>"Drunk or raving,"<qe/> said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="treasure.c33.p12" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="treasure.c33.s22"><qs/>"Ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,"<qe/> quoth Silver.</s> <s sid="23" id="treasure.c33.s23"><qs/>"You would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that.</s> <s sid="24" id="treasure.c33.s24">I'm on your side now, hand and glove; and I shouldn't wish for to see the party weakened, let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you.</s> <s sid="25" id="treasure.c33.s25">But these men down there, they couldn't keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to; and what's more, they couldn't believe as you could."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="treasure.c33.p13" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="treasure.c33.s26"><qs/>"No,"<qe/> said the doctor.</s> <s sid="27" id="treasure.c33.s27"><qs/>"You're the man to keep your word, we know that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="treasure.c33.p14"><s sid="28" id="treasure.c33.s28">Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates.</s> <s sid="29" id="treasure.c33.s29">Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.</s> <s sid="30" id="treasure.c33.s30">A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray.</s> <s sid="31" id="treasure.c33.s31">We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="treasure.c33.p15"><s sid="32" id="treasure.c33.s32">That was about our last doing on the island.</s> <s sid="33" id="treasure.c33.s33">Before that, we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="treasure.c33.p16"><s sid="34" id="treasure.c33.s34">The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for, as we soon had proved.</s> <s sid="35" id="treasure.c33.s35">For coming through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication.</s> <s sid="36" id="treasure.c33.s36">It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness.</s> <s sid="37" id="treasure.c33.s37">The doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were to find them.</s> <s sid="38" id="treasure.c33.s38">But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us, for God's sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="treasure.c33.p17"><s sid="39" id="treasure.c33.s39">At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over Silver's head and through the main-sail.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="treasure.c33.p18"><s sid="40" id="treasure.c33.s40">After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance.</s> <s sid="41" id="treasure.c33.s41">That was, at least, the end of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="treasure.c33.p19"><s sid="42" id="treasure.c33.s42">We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet.</s> <s sid="43" id="treasure.c33.s43">We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="treasure.c33.p20"><s sid="44" id="treasure.c33.s44">It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money.</s> <s sid="45" id="treasure.c33.s45">The sight of so many good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of the night.</s> <s sid="46" id="treasure.c33.s46">Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and, in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the HISPANIOLA.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="treasure.c33.p21" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="treasure.c33.s47">Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession.</s> <s sid="48" id="treasure.c33.s48">Silver was gone.</s> <s sid="49" id="treasure.c33.s49">The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago, and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which would certainly have been forfeit if <qs/>"that man with the one leg had stayed aboard."<qe/></s> <s sid="50" id="treasure.c33.s50">But this was not all.</s> <s sid="51" id="treasure.c33.s51">The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed.</s> <s sid="52" id="treasure.c33.s52">He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas, to help him on his further wanderings.</s> </p>
