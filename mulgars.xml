<title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="mulgars.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="mulgars.c1.s1">On the borders of the Forest of Munza-mulgar lived once an old grey fruit-monkey of the name of Mutt-matutta.</s> <s sid="2" id="mulgars.c1.s2">She had three sons, the eldest Thumma, the next Thimbulla, and the youngest, who was a Nizza-neela, Ummanodda.</s> <s sid="3" id="mulgars.c1.s3">And they called each other for short, Thumb, Thimble, and Nod.</s> <s sid="4" id="mulgars.c1.s4">The rickety, tumble-down old wooden hut in which they lived had been built 319 Munza years before by a traveller, a Portugall or Portingal, lost in the forest 22,997 leagues from home.</s> <s sid="5" id="mulgars.c1.s5">After he was dead, there came scrambling along on his fours one peaceful evening a Mulgar (or, as we say in English, a monkey) named Zebbah.</s> <s sid="6" id="mulgars.c1.s6">At first sight of the hut he held his head on one side awhile, and stood quite still, listening, his broad-nosed face lit up in the blaze of the setting sun.</s> <s sid="7" id="mulgars.c1.s7">He then hobbled a little nearer, and peeped into the hut.</s> <s sid="8" id="mulgars.c1.s8">Whereupon he hobbled away a little, but soon came back and peeped again.</s> <s sid="9" id="mulgars.c1.s9">At last he ventured near, and, pushing back the tangle of creepers and matted grasses, groped through the door and went in.</s> <s sid="10" id="mulgars.c1.s10">And there, in a dark corner, lay the Portingal's little heap of bones.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mulgars.c1.p2"><s sid="11" id="mulgars.c1.s11">The hut was dry as tinder.</s> <s sid="12" id="mulgars.c1.s12">It had in it a broken fire-stone, a kind of chest or cupboard, a table, and a stool, both rough and insect-bitten, but still strong.</s> <s sid="13" id="mulgars.c1.s13">Zebbah sniffed and grunted, and pushed and peered about.</s> <s sid="14" id="mulgars.c1.s14">And he found all manner of strange and precious stuff half buried in the hut--pots for Subbub; pestles and basins for Manaka-cake, etc.; three bags of great beads, clear, blue, and emerald; an old rusty musket; nine ephelantoes' tusks; a bag of Margarita stones; and many other things, besides cloth and spider-silk and dried-up fruits and fishes.</s> <s sid="15" id="mulgars.c1.s15">He made his dwelling there, and died there.</s> <s sid="16" id="mulgars.c1.s16">This Mulgar, Zebbah, was Mutta-matutta's great-great-great-grandfather.</s> <s sid="17" id="mulgars.c1.s17">Dead and gone were all.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mulgars.c1.p3"><s sid="18" id="mulgars.c1.s18">Now, one day when Mutta-matutta was young, and her father had gone into the forest for Sudd-fruit, there came limping along a most singular Mulgar towards the house.</s> <s sid="19" id="mulgars.c1.s19">He was bent and shrunken, shivering and coughing, but he walked as men walk, his nut-shaped head bending up out of a big red jacket.</s> <s sid="20" id="mulgars.c1.s20">His shoulder and the top of his head were worn bare by the rubbing of the bundle he carried.</s> <s sid="21" id="mulgars.c1.s21">And behind him came stumbling along another Mulgar, his servant, with a few rags tied round his body, who could not at first speak, his tongue was so much swollen from his having bitten in the dark a poison-spider in his nuts.</s> <s sid="22" id="mulgars.c1.s22">The name of his master was Seelem; his own name was Glint.</s> <s sid="23" id="mulgars.c1.s23">This Seelem fell very sick.</s> <s sid="24" id="mulgars.c1.s24">Mutta-matutta nursed him night and day, with the sourest monkey-physic.</s> <s sid="25" id="mulgars.c1.s25">He was pulled crooked with pain and the shivers, or rain-fever.</s> <s sid="26" id="mulgars.c1.s26">The tips of the hairs on his head had in his wanderings turned snow-white.</s> <s sid="27" id="mulgars.c1.s27">But he bore his pain and his sickness (and his physic) without one groan of complaint.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mulgars.c1.p4"><s sid="28" id="mulgars.c1.s28">And Glint, who fetched water and gathered sticks and nuts, and helped Mutta-matutta, told her that his master, Seelem, was a Mulla-mulgar--that is, a Mulgar of the Blood Royal--and own brother to Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mulgars.c1.p5"><s sid="29" id="mulgars.c1.s29">He told her, also, that his master had wearied of Assasimmon's valley-palace, his fine food and dishes, his music of shells and strings, his countless Mulgar-slaves, beasts, and groves and gardens; and that, having chosen three servants, Jacca, Glutt, and himself, he had left his brother's valleys, to discover what lay beyond the Arakkaboa Mountains.</s> <s sid="30" id="mulgars.c1.s30">But Jacca had perished of frost-bite on the southern slopes of the Peak of Tishnar, and Glutt had been eaten by the Minimuls.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mulgars.c1.p6"><s sid="31" id="mulgars.c1.s31">He was very silent and gloomy, this Mulla-mulgar, Seelem, but glad to rest his bruised and weary bones in the hut.</s> <s sid="32" id="mulgars.c1.s32">And when Mutta-matutta's father died from sleeping in the moon-mist at Sudd-ripening, Seelem untied his travelling bundle and made his home in the hut.</s> <s sid="33" id="mulgars.c1.s33">Mutta-matutta was a lonely and rather sad Mulgar, so at this she rejoiced, for she had grown from fearing to love the royal old wanderer.</s> <s sid="34" id="mulgars.c1.s34">And she helped him to put away all that was in his bundles into the Portingal's chest--three shirts of cotton; two red jackets, like his own, with metal hooks; a sheep's-coat, with ivory buttons and pocket-flaps; three skin shoes (for one had been lost out of his bundle in the forest); a cap of Mamasul skin (very precious); besides knives, fire-strikers, a hollow cup of ivory, magic physic-powder, two combs of Impaleena-horn, a green serpent-skin for sweetening water, etc., and, beyond and above all, the milk-white Wonderstone of Tishnar.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mulgars.c1.p7"><s sid="35" id="mulgars.c1.s35">Here they lived, Seelem and Mutta (as he called her), in the Portingal's old hut, for thirteen years.</s> <s sid="36" id="mulgars.c1.s36">And Mutta was happy with Seelem and her three sons, Thumb, Thimble, and Nod.</s> <s sid="37" id="mulgars.c1.s37">They had a water-spring, honey-boxes or baskets for the bees in the Ollaconda-trees, a shed or huddle of green branches, for Glint, and a big patch of Ummuz-cane.</s> <s sid="38" id="mulgars.c1.s38">Nod slept in a kind of hole or burrow in the roof, with a tiny peeping-hole, from which he used to scare the birds from his father's Ummuz.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mulgars.c1.p8"><s sid="39" id="mulgars.c1.s39">Mutta wished only that Seelem was not quite so grim and broody; that the Munza-mulgars (forest-monkeys) would not come stealing her Subbub and honey; and that the Portingal's hut stood quite out of the silvery moon-mist that rose from the swamp; for she suffered (as do most fruit-monkeys) from the bones-ache.</s> <s sid="40" id="mulgars.c1.s40">Seelem was gentle and easy in his own moody way with Mutta and his three sons, but, most of all, he cheered his heart with tiny Nod, the Nizza-neela.</s> <s sid="41" id="mulgars.c1.s41">Sometimes all day long this old travel-worn Mulla-mulgar never uttered a sound, save at evening, when he sang or droned his evening hymn to Tishnar.[1] He kept a thick stick, which he called his Guzza, to punish his three sons when they were idle and sullen, or gluttonous, or with Munza tricks pestered their mother.</s> <s sid="42" id="mulgars.c1.s42">And he never favoured Nod beyond the others more than all good fathers favour the youngest, the littlest, and the gaysomest of their children.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mulgars.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="mulgars.c1.s43">[1] Tishnar is a very ancient word in Munza, and means that which cannot be thought about in words, or told, or expressed.</s> <s sid="44" id="mulgars.c1.s44">So all the wonderful, secret, and quiet world beyond the Mulgars' lives is Tishnar--wind and stars, too, the sea and the endless unknown.</s> <s sid="45" id="mulgars.c1.s45">But here it is only the Beautiful One of the Mountains that is meant.</s> <s sid="46" id="mulgars.c1.s46">So beautiful is she that a Mulgar who dreams even of one of her Maidens, and wakes still in the presence of his dream, can no longer be happy in the company of his kind.</s> <s sid="47" id="mulgars.c1.s47">He hides himself away in some old hole or rocky fastness, lightless, matted, and uncombed, and so thins and pines, or becomes a Wanderer or Moh-mulgar.</s> <s sid="48" id="mulgars.c1.s48">But it is rare for this to be, for very few Mulgars dream beyond the mere forest, as it were; and fewer still keep the memories of their dreams when the livelong vision of Munza returns to their waking eyes.</s> <s sid="49" id="mulgars.c1.s49">The Valleys of Tishnar lie on either flank of the Mountains of Arakkaboa, though she herself wanders only in the stillness of the mountain snows.</s> <s sid="50" id="mulgars.c1.s50">She is shown veiled on the rude pots of Assasimmon and in Mulgar scratch-work, with one slim-fingered hand clasping her robe of palest purple, her head bent a little, as if hearkening to her thoughts; and she is shod with sandals of silver.</s> <s sid="51" id="mulgars.c1.s51">Of these things the wandering Oomgar-nuggas, or black men, tell.</s> <s sid="52" id="mulgars.c1.s52">From Tishnar, too, comes the Last Sleep--the sleep of all the World.</s> <s sid="53" id="mulgars.c1.s53">The last sleep just of their own life only is Noomanossi--darkness, change, and the unreturning.</s> <s sid="54" id="mulgars.c1.s54">And Immanala is she who preys across these shadows, in this valley.</s> <s sid="55" id="mulgars.c1.s55">So, too, the Mulgars say, <qs/>"Nooma, Nooma,"<qe/><sls/> when they mean shadow, as <sle/><qs/>"In the sun paces a leopard's Nooma at her side."<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="mulgars.c1.s56">Meermut, which means in part also shadow, is the shadow, as it were, of lesser light lost in Tishnar's radiance, just as moonlight may cast a shadow of a pine-tree across a smouldering fire.</s> <s sid="57" id="mulgars.c1.s57">There is, too, a faint wind that breathes in the first twilight and starshine of Munza called the Wind of Tishnar.</s> <s sid="58" id="mulgars.c1.s58">It was, I think, the faint murmur of this wind that echoed in the ear of Mutta-matutta as she lay dying, for in dying one hears, it is said, what in life would carry no more tidings to the mind than light brings to the hand.</s> <s sid="59" id="mulgars.c1.s59">Nod's bells that he heard, and thought were his father's, must have been the Zevveras' bells of Tishnar's Water-middens, all wandering Meermuts.</s> <s sid="60" id="mulgars.c1.s60">These Water-middens, or Water-maidens, are like the beauty of the moonlight.</s> <s sid="61" id="mulgars.c1.s61">The countless voices of fountain, torrent, and cataract are theirs.</s> <s sid="62" id="mulgars.c1.s62">They, with other of Tishnar's Maidens, come riding on their belled Zevveras, and a strange silence falls where their little invisible horses are tethered; while, perhaps, the Maidens sit feasting in a dell, grey with moonbeams and ghostly flowers.</s> <s sid="63" id="mulgars.c1.s63">Even the sullen Mullabruk learns somehow of their presence, and turns aside on his fours from the silvery mist of their glades and green alleys, just as in the same wise a cold air seems to curdle his skin when some haunting Nooma passes by.</s> <s sid="64" id="mulgars.c1.s64">All the inward shadows of the creatures of Munza-mulgar are Noomanossi's; all their phantoms, spirits, or Meermuts are Tishnar's.</s> <s sid="65" id="mulgars.c1.s65">And so there is a never-ending changeableness and strife in their short lives.</s> <s sid="66" id="mulgars.c1.s66">The leopard (or Roses, as they call her, for the beauty of her clear black spots) is Meermut to her cubs, Nooma to the dodging Skeetoes she lies in wait for, stretched along a bough.</s> <s sid="67" id="mulgars.c1.s67">Her beauty is Tishnar's; the savagery of her claws is Noomanossi's.</s> <s sid="68" id="mulgars.c1.s68">So Munza's children are dark or bright, lovely or estranging, according as Meermut or Nooma prevails in their natures.</s> <s sid="69" id="mulgars.c1.s69">And thus, too, they choose the habitation of their bodies.</s> <s sid="70" id="mulgars.c1.s70">Yet because dark is but day gone, and cruelty unkindness, therefore even the heart-shattering Noomanossi, even Immanala herself, is only absent Tishnar.</s> <s sid="71" id="mulgars.c1.s71">But there, as everyone can see, I am only chattering about what I cannot understand.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mulgars.c1.p10"><s sid="72" id="mulgars.c1.s72">One of the first things that Nod remembered was Glint's tumbling from the great Ukka-tree, which he had climbed at ripening-time, bough up to bough from the bottom, cracking shells and eating all the way, until, forgetting how heavy he had become, he swung his fat body on to a slender and withered branch, and fell all a-topple from top to bottom on to the back of his thick skull.</s> <s sid="73" id="mulgars.c1.s73">Beneath this same dark-leaved tree Seelem buried his servant, together with a pot of subbub, seven loaves or cakes, and a long stick of Ummuz-cane.</s> <s sid="74" id="mulgars.c1.s74">But Mutta-matutta after his death would never touch an Ukka-nut again.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mulgars.c1.p11"><s sid="75" id="mulgars.c1.s75">Seelem taught his sons how to make fire, what nuts and roots and fruits and grasses were wholesome for eating; what herbs and bark and pith for physic; what reeds and barks for cloth.</s> <s sid="76" id="mulgars.c1.s76">He taught them how to take honey without being stung; how to count; how to find their way by the chief and brightest among the stars; to cut cudgels, to build leaf-huts and huddles against heat or rain.</s> <s sid="77" id="mulgars.c1.s77">He taught them, too, the common tongue of the Forest-monkeys--that is the language of nearly all the Mulgars that live in the forests of Munza--Jacquet-mulgars, Mullabruks, purple-faced and saffron-headed Mulgars, Skeetoes, tuft-waving Manquabees, Fly-catchers and Squirrel-tails, and many more than I can mention.</s> <s sid="78" id="mulgars.c1.s78">Seelem taught them also a little of the languages of the dreaded Gunga-mulgars, of the Collobs, and the Babbaboomas.</s> <s sid="79" id="mulgars.c1.s79">But the Minimul-mulgars' and the Oomgars' or man-monkeys' languages (white, black, or yellow) he could not teach, because he did not know them.</s> <s sid="80" id="mulgars.c1.s80">When, however, they were alone together they spoke the secret language of the Mulla-mulgars dwelling north of the Arakkaboas--that is, Mulgar-royal.</s> <s sid="81" id="mulgars.c1.s81">This language in some ways resembles that of the Portugalls, in some that of the Oggewibbies, and, here and there--but in very little--Garniereze.</s> <s sid="82" id="mulgars.c1.s82">Seelem, of course, taught his sons, and especially Thumb, many other things besides--more, certainly, than would contain itself in a little book like this.</s> <s sid="83" id="mulgars.c1.s83">But, above all, he taught them to walk upright, never to taste blood, and never, unless in danger or despair, to climb trees or to grow a tail.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mulgars.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="mulgars.c1.s84">But now, after all these thirteen years of absence from Assasimmon's palace in the beautiful Valleys of Tishnar, Seelem began to desire more and more to see again his home and his brother, with whom as a child he had walked in scarlet and Mamasul, and drunk his syrup from an ivory cup.</s> <s sid="85" id="mulgars.c1.s85">He grew more gloomy and morose than ever, squatted alone, his eyes fixed mournfully in the air.</s> <s sid="86" id="mulgars.c1.s86">And Mutta would whisper to Nod:</s> <s sid="87" id="mulgars.c1.s87"><qs/>"Sst, zun nizza-neela, tus-weeta zan nuome."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mulgars.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="mulgars.c1.s88">The more cunning of the Forest-mulgars at first had come in troops to Seelem, laden with gifts of nuts and fruits, because they were afraid of him.</s> <s sid="89" id="mulgars.c1.s89">But he would sit in his red jacket and merely stare at them as if they were no better than flies.</s> <s sid="90" id="mulgars.c1.s90">And at last they began in revenge to do him as much mischief as their wits could contrive, until he grew utterly weary of their scuffling and quarrelling, their thumbs and colours, fleas and tails.</s> <s sid="91" id="mulgars.c1.s91">At last he could hear himself no longer, and one morning, in the first haze of sunrise over the sleeping forest, he called Mutta and his three sons to where he sat in the shadow of Glint's great budding Ukka-tree.</s> <s sid="92" id="mulgars.c1.s92">And he told them he was going on a long journey--<qs/>"beyond and beyond, forest and river, forest swamp and river, the mountains of Arakkaboa, leagues, leagues away"<qe/>--to seek again the Valleys of Tishnar.</s> <s sid="93" id="mulgars.c1.s93"><qs/>"And I will come back,"<qe/><sls/> he said, leaning his hand upon the ground and blinking at Nod, <sle/><qs/>"with slaves and scarlet and food-baskets and Zevveras, and bring you all there with me.</s> <s sid="94" id="mulgars.c1.s94">But first I must go alone and find the way through dangers thick as flies, O Mulla-mulgars.</s> <s sid="95" id="mulgars.c1.s95">Wait here and guard your old mother, Mutta-matutta, my sons, her Ummuz and ukkas.</s> <s sid="96" id="mulgars.c1.s96">And grow strong, O tailless ones, till I return.</s> <s sid="97" id="mulgars.c1.s97">Zu zoube seese muglareen, een suang no nouano zupbf!"<qe/></s> <s sid="98" id="mulgars.c1.s98">And that was all he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mulgars.c1.p14"><s sid="99" id="mulgars.c1.s99">But Mutta-matutta, though she could not hide her grief at his going, helped him in every way she could to be quickly gone.</s> <s sid="100" id="mulgars.c1.s100">He seemed beside himself, this white, old, crooked Mulla-mulgar.</s> <s sid="101" id="mulgars.c1.s101">His eyes blazed; he went muttering; he'd throw up his hands and snuff and snuff, as if the very wind bore Tishnar on its wings.</s> <s sid="102" id="mulgars.c1.s102">And even at night he'd rise up in the darkness and open the door and listen as if out of the immeasurable and solitudinous forests he heard voices calling him from far away.</s> <s sid="103" id="mulgars.c1.s103">At length, in his last shirt (which had been carefully kept these thirteen years, with a dead kingfisher and a bag of civet, to keep off the cockroaches); in his finest red jacket and his cap of Mamasul-skin; with a great bundle of Manaka-cake and Ummuz-cane, knife and fire-striker and physic, and the old Portingal's rusty musket on his shoulder, he was ready to be off.</s> <s sid="104" id="mulgars.c1.s104">In the early morning he came stooping under the little hut-door.</s> <s sid="105" id="mulgars.c1.s105">He looked at his hut and his water-spring, at his bees and canes; he looked at his three sons, and at old Mutta-matutta, with a great frown, and trembled.</s> <s sid="106" id="mulgars.c1.s106">And Mutta could not bear to say good-bye; she lifted her crooked hands above her old head, the tears running down her cheeks, and she went and hid herself in the hut till he was gone.</s> <s sid="107" id="mulgars.c1.s107">But his three sons went a little way with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mulgars.c1.p15"><s sid="108" id="mulgars.c1.s108">Thumb and Thimble hopped along with his heavy bundle on a stick between them to the branching of the Mulgar-track, which here runs nearly two paces wide into the gloom of Munza-mulgar; while Nod sat on Seelem's shoulder, sucking a stick of Ummuz-cane, and clutching the long, cold, rusty barrel of his musket.</s> <s sid="109" id="mulgars.c1.s109">The trees of the forest lifted their branches in a trembling haze of heat, hung with grey thorny ropes, and vines and trailing creepers of Cullum and Samarak, vivid with leaves, and with large cuplike waxen flowers, moon-white, amber, mauve, and scarlet.</s> <s sid="110" id="mulgars.c1.s110">Butterflies like blots and splashes of flame, wee Tominiscoes, ruby and emerald and amethyst, shimmered and spangled and sipped and hovered.</s> <s sid="111" id="mulgars.c1.s111">And a thin, twangling, immeasurable murmur like the strings of Noomanossi's harp rose from the tiny millions that made their nests and mounds and burrows in the forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mulgars.c1.p16"><s sid="112" id="mulgars.c1.s112">Seelem took his sons one by one by the shoulders, and looked into their eyes, and touched noses.</s> <s sid="113" id="mulgars.c1.s113">And they lifted their hands in salutation, and watched him till he was gone from sight.</s> <s sid="114" id="mulgars.c1.s114">But though his grey face was all wizened up with trouble and wet with tears, he never so much as once looked behind him, lest his sons should cry after him, or he turn back.</s> <s sid="115" id="mulgars.c1.s115">So, presently, after they all three lifted their hands once more, as if his Meermut[2] might still haunt near; and then they went home to their mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mulgars.c1.p17"><s sid="116" id="mulgars.c1.s116">[2] "Meermut" is shadow, phantom, spectre, or even the pictured remembrance of anything in the mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mulgars.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="mulgars.c1.s117">But the rains came; he did not return.</s> <s sid="118" id="mulgars.c1.s118">The long days strode softly by, the chatter and screams of Munza at dawn, the long-drawn, moaning shout of Mullabruk to Mullabruk as darkness deepened.</s> <s sid="119" id="mulgars.c1.s119">Nod would sometimes venture a little way into the forest, hoping to hear the gongs that his father had told him the close-shorn slaves of Assasimmon tie with leopard-thongs about their Zevveras' necks.</s> <s sid="120" id="mulgars.c1.s120">He would sit in the gigantic shadows of evening, watching the fireflies, and saying to himself:</s> <s sid="121" id="mulgars.c1.s121"><qs/>"Sst, Nod, see what they say--to-morrow!"<qe/></s> <s sid="122" id="mulgars.c1.s122">But the morrow never came that brought him back his father.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mulgars.c1.p19"><s sid="123" id="mulgars.c1.s123">Mutta-matutta cared and cooked for them.</s> <s sid="124" id="mulgars.c1.s124">She made a great store of Manaka-cake, packed for coolness all neatly in plantain-leaves; Nano-cheese, and two or three big pots of Subbub.</s> <s sid="125" id="mulgars.c1.s125">She kept them clean and combed; plastered and physicked them; taught them to cook, and many things else, until, as one by one they grew up, they knew all that she _could_ teach them, except the wisdom to use what they had learnt.</s> <s sid="126" id="mulgars.c1.s126">She would often, too, in the first hush of night, tell them stories of their father, and of her own father, back even to Zebbah, and the Portingal dangling with his bunch of wild-cats' tails in the corner.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mulgars.c1.p20"><s sid="127" id="mulgars.c1.s127">But as the years wasted away, she grew thin and mournful, and fell ill of pining and grief and age, and even had at last to keep to her bed of moss and cotton in the hut.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mulgars.c13.p7"><s sid="22" id="mulgars.c13.s22">They watched them sprinkling, scratching themselves, like the Mullabruks, with their feet, and dusting their great bodies with dry snow, rubbing it in with their hands, though for what purpose, seeing that snow had never whitened their pilgrimages before, who can say?</s> <s sid="23" id="mulgars.c13.s23">The children, the Karakeena-Babbaboomas, squealed and frisked and gambolled in the last sunshine together, quarrelling and at play.</s> <s sid="24" id="mulgars.c13.s24">The old men sat silent, munching with half-closed eyes, and watching them.</s> <s sid="25" id="mulgars.c13.s25">And it seemed that the big shes of the Babbaboomas had brought some small tufty, goatlike animals with them, which they now sat milking into pots or gourds.</s> <s sid="26" id="mulgars.c13.s26">And with this milk they presently fed the littlest of the young ones.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mulgars.c13.p9"><s sid="36" id="mulgars.c13.s36">By morning (for the Babbaboomas are on the march before daybreak), when the brothers awoke, cold and cramped, in their rocky cavern, the whole concourse was gone, and not a sign left of them except their scattered shells and husks, their innumerable footprints, and the stones they had rooted up in search of whatever small creeping food might lurk beneath.</s> <s sid="37" id="mulgars.c13.s37">Else they seemed a dream--Meermuts of the moonlight!</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mulgars.c13.p10"><s sid="38" id="mulgars.c13.s38">By noon of next day the travellers approached the mountain-slopes.</s> <s sid="39" id="mulgars.c13.s39">They crossed down into a valley, and now the farther they went the steeper rose the bare, snow-flecked mountain-side, and beyond and around them loftier heights yet, while in the midst spired into the midday Kush, the first of the seven of the sacred peaks of Tishnar.</s> <s sid="40" id="mulgars.c13.s40">Ever and again they were startled by the sudden crash of the snow sweeping in long-drawn avalanches from the steeps of the hills.</s> <s sid="41" id="mulgars.c13.s41">And though it was desolate to see those towering and unfriendly mountains, their snowy precipices and dazzling peaks, yet their hearts came back to them, for a warm wind was blowing through the valley, and they knew the white and cold of the snow would soon be over, and the forest be green again, and once more would come the flowering of the fruit-trees, and the ripening of the nuts.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mulgars.c13.p11"><s sid="42" id="mulgars.c13.s42">But here it was that a bitter quarrel began between the brothers that might have ended in not one of them ever seeing Tishnar's Valleys alive.</s> <s sid="43" id="mulgars.c13.s43">It was like this:</s> <s sid="44" id="mulgars.c13.s44">Not knowing in which direction to be going in order to seek for a path or pass whereby to scale Arakkaboa, they were at a loss what to be doing.</s> <s sid="45" id="mulgars.c13.s45">Even the Munza-mulgars detest being more than the height of the loftiest forest-tree above their shadows on the ground; more especially, therefore, did these Mulla-mulgars, who never, or very rarely, as I have said many times already, climb trees at all.</s> <s sid="46" id="mulgars.c13.s46">So they determined to stay awhile here and rest and eat until some Mulgar should come along of whom they could ask the way.</s> <s sid="47" id="mulgars.c13.s47">It was a valley rich with the sweet ground-fruit I have already mentioned, whose spikes of a faint and thorny blue mount just above the snow, and whose berries, owing to their sugary coats or pods, resist all coldness.</s> <s sid="48" id="mulgars.c13.s48">So that, without mention of Ukka-nuts, of which a grove grew not far beyond the bend of the valley, the travellers had plenty to eat.</s> <s sid="49" id="mulgars.c13.s49">They had also an abundance of water, because of a little torrent that came roaring through its ice near by the trees they had chosen for their lodging.</s> <s sid="50" id="mulgars.c13.s50">The wind that softly blew along this low land was warmer, or, at least, not so keen and fitful as the forest wind, and they were by now growing accustomed to the cold.</s> <s sid="51" id="mulgars.c13.s51">For the night, however, they raised up for themselves a kind of leaning shelter, or huddle, of branches to be moved against the wind according as it blew up or down the valley.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mulgars.c13.p12"><s sid="52" id="mulgars.c13.s52">But idleness leads to mischief.</s> <s sid="53" id="mulgars.c13.s53">And not to press on is to be sliding backward.</s> <s sid="54" id="mulgars.c13.s54">And to wait for help is to let help limp out of sight.</s> <s sid="55" id="mulgars.c13.s55">And overcome, perhaps, by the luscious fruit, of which they ate far too much and far too often, and growing sluggardly with sleep, the travellers soon went on to bickering and scuffling together.</s> <s sid="56" id="mulgars.c13.s56">With all this food, too, and long sleep and idleness, their courage began to droop.</s> <s sid="57" id="mulgars.c13.s57">And if they heard any sound of living thing, even so much as a call or crackling branch, they would sneak off and hide in their night-shelter, not caring now for any kind of boldness nor to think of venturing over these homeless mountains.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mulgars.c13.p13"><s sid="58" id="mulgars.c13.s58">So it came about that one night, as they were sleeping together under their huddle, as was their custom, Thumb, who had been nibbling fruit nearly all day long, cried out in a loud and terrible voice in his sleep, till Thimble, half awakened by his raving, picked up his thick cudgel and laid it soundly across his brother's shoulders where he lay.</s> <s sid="59" id="mulgars.c13.s59">Thumb started up out of his sleep, and in an instant the two brothers were up and at each other, wrestling and kicking, gnashing their teeth, and guzzling through their throats and noses like mere Gungas, Mullabruks, or Manquabees.</s> <s sid="60" id="mulgars.c13.s60">Poor Nod, not knowing what was the cause of all the trouble, got a much worse drubbing than either, till at last, in their furious struggling, all three brothers rolled from under the wattles into the pale glimmering of the stars and snow.</s> <s sid="61" id="mulgars.c13.s61">For in this valley after the sun goes moves a phantom light or phosphorescence over the snow.</s> <s sid="62" id="mulgars.c13.s62">Brought suddenly to their senses by the chill dark air, the travellers sat dimly glaring one at another, hunched, bruised, and breathless.</s> <s sid="63" id="mulgars.c13.s63">And Nod, seeing his brothers so enraged, and preparing to fight again, and having had half his senses battered out by their rough usage, asked what was amiss.</s> </p>
