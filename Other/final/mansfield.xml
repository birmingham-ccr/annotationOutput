<qe/><title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="mansfield.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="mansfield.c1.s1">About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income.</s> <s sid="2" id="mansfield.c1.s2">All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.</s> <s sid="3" id="mansfield.c1.s3">She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage.</s> <s sid="4" id="mansfield.c1.s4">But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.</s> <s sid="5" id="mansfield.c1.s5">Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev.</s> <s sid="6" id="mansfield.c1.s6">Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.</s> <s sid="7" id="mansfield.c1.s7">Miss Ward's match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible:</s> <s sid="8" id="mansfield.c1.s8">Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c1.s9">But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly.</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c1.s10">She could hardly have made a more untoward choice.</s> <s sid="11" id="mansfield.c1.s11">Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which, from principle as well as pride--from a general wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability, he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram's sister; but her husband's profession was such as no interest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c1.s12">It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces.</s> <s sid="13" id="mansfield.c1.s13">To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c1.s14">Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c1.s15">Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c1.p2"><s sid="16" id="mansfield.c1.s16">Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other's existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry voice, that Fanny had got another child.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c1.s17">By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c1.s18">A large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active service, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very small income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation.</s> <s sid="19" id="mansfield.c1.s19">She was preparing for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance of the eight already in being.</s> <s sid="20" id="mansfield.c1.s20">Her eldest was a boy of ten years old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world; but what could she do?</s> <s sid="21" id="mansfield.c1.s21">Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?</s> <s sid="22" id="mansfield.c1.s22">No situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c1.p3"><s sid="23" id="mansfield.c1.s23">The letter was not unproductive.</s> <s sid="24" id="mansfield.c1.s24">It re-established peace and kindness.</s> <s sid="25" id="mansfield.c1.s25">Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="mansfield.c1.s26">Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it.</s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c1.s27">Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for her, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.</s> <s sid="28" id="mansfield.c1.s28"><qs/>"What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter, a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give?</s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c1.s29">The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action."<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="mansfield.c1.s30">Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly.</s> <s sid="31" id="mansfield.c1.s31"><qs/>"I think we cannot do better,"<qe/><sss/> said she; <sse/><qs/>"let us send for the child."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c1.p5"><s sid="32" id="mansfield.c1.s32">Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c1.s33">He debated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking her from her family.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c1.s34">He thought of his own four children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner had he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mansfield.c1.s35"><qs/>"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c1.s36">Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?--and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am a woman of few words and professions.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c1.s37">Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c1.s38">Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c1.s39">A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages.</s> <s sid="40" id="mansfield.c1.s40">I don't say she would be so handsome as her cousins.</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c1.s41">I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable establishment.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c1.s42">You are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that, of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters?</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c1.s43">It is morally impossible.</s> <s sid="44" id="mansfield.c1.s44">I never knew an instance of it.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c1.s45">It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against the connexion.</s> <s sid="46" id="mansfield.c1.s46">Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and I dare say there would be mischief.</s> <s sid="47" id="mansfield.c1.s47">The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love with her.</s> <s sid="48" id="mansfield.c1.s48">But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than a sister."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="mansfield.c1.s49"><qs/>"There is a great deal of truth in what you say,"<qe/><sss/> replied Sir Thomas, <sse/><qs/>"and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.</s> <s sid="50" id="mansfield.c1.s50">I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to ourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mansfield.c1.s51"><qs/>"I thoroughly understand you,"<qe/><sss/> cried Mrs. Norris, <sse/><qs/>"you are everything that is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point.</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c1.s52">Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her.</s> <s sid="53" id="mansfield.c1.s53">Is not she a sister's child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her?</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c1.s54">My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c1.s55">So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield; _you_ shall have no trouble about it.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c1.s56">My own trouble, you know, I never regard.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c1.s57">I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet her there.</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c1.s58">They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going.</s> <s sid="59" id="mansfield.c1.s59">I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other going up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c1.p9"><s sid="60" id="mansfield.c1.s60">Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled, and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed.</s> <s sid="61" id="mansfield.c1.s61">The division of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have been equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.</s> <s sid="62" id="mansfield.c1.s62">As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.</s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c1.s63">Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of economy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply.</s> <s sid="64" id="mansfield.c1.s64">Had there been a family to provide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having no care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to.</s> <s sid="65" id="mansfield.c1.s65">Under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mansfield.c1.s66">When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's calm inquiry of <qs/>"Where shall the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?"<qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c1.s67">Sir Thomas heard with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's power to take any share in the personal charge of her.</s> <s sid="68" id="mansfield.c1.s68">He had been considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found himself wholly mistaken.</s> <s sid="69" id="mansfield.c1.s69">Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl's staying with them, at least as things then were, was quite out of the question.</s> <s sid="70" id="mansfield.c1.s70">Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his gouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be glad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="mansfield.c1.s71"><qs/>"Then she had better come to us,"<qe/> said Lady Bertram, with the utmost composure.</s> <s sid="72" id="mansfield.c1.s72">After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, <qs/>"Yes, let her home be in this house.</s> <s sid="73" id="mansfield.c1.s73">We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and of a regular instructress."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mansfield.c1.s74"><qs/>"Very true,"<qe/><sss/> cried Mrs. Norris, <sse/><qs/>"which are both very important considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach, or only two--there can be no difference.</s> <s sid="75" id="mansfield.c1.s75">I only wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power.</s> <s sid="76" id="mansfield.c1.s76">I am not one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days.</s> <s sid="77" id="mansfield.c1.s77">I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little white attic, near the old nurseries.</s> <s sid="78" id="mansfield.c1.s78">It will be much the best place for her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others.</s> <s sid="79" id="mansfield.c1.s79">Indeed, I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c1.p13"><s sid="80" id="mansfield.c1.s80">Lady Bertram made no opposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="mansfield.c1.s81"><qs/>"I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,"<qe/><sss/> continued Mrs. Norris, <sse/><qs/>"and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="mansfield.c1.s82"><qs/>"Should her disposition be really bad,"<qe/><sss/> said Sir Thomas, <sse/><qs/>"we must not, for our own children's sake, continue her in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil.</s> <s sid="83" id="mansfield.c1.s83">We shall probably see much to wish altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for her associates.</s> <s sid="84" id="mansfield.c1.s84">Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the association."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="mansfield.c1.s85"><qs/>"That is exactly what I think,"<qe/><sss/> cried Mrs. Norris, <sse/><qs/>"and what I was saying to my husband this morning.</s> <s sid="86" id="mansfield.c1.s86">It will be an education for the child, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="mansfield.c1.s87"><qs/>"I hope she will not tease my poor pug,"<qe/><sss/> said Lady Bertram; <sse/><qs/>"I have but just got Julia to leave it alone."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="mansfield.c1.s88"><qs/>"There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,"<qe/><sss/> observed Sir Thomas, <sse/><qs/>"as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make her remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_.</s> <s sid="89" id="mansfield.c1.s89">I should wish to see them very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot be equals.</s> <s sid="90" id="mansfield.c1.s90">Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will always be different.</s> <s sid="91" id="mansfield.c1.s91">It is a point of great delicacy, and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mansfield.c1.p19"><s sid="92" id="mansfield.c1.s92">Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that between them it would be easily managed.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mansfield.c1.p20"><s sid="93" id="mansfield.c1.s93">It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister in vain.</s> <s sid="94" id="mansfield.c1.s94">Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most thankfully, assuring them of her daughter's being a very well-disposed, good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off.</s> <s sid="95" id="mansfield.c1.s95">She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.</s> <s sid="96" id="mansfield.c1.s96">Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mansfield.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="mansfield.c2.s1">The little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others, and recommending her to their kindness.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="mansfield.c2.s2">Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least, nothing to disgust her relations.</s> <s sid="3" id="mansfield.c2.s3">She was small of her age, with no glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy, and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar, her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty.</s> <s sid="4" id="mansfield.c2.s4">Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir Thomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that was conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or speaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of the two.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="mansfield.c2.s5">The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall of their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin.</s> <s sid="6" id="mansfield.c2.s6">The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity.</s> <s sid="7" id="mansfield.c2.s7">But they were too much used to company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their confidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they were soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c2.p4"><s sid="8" id="mansfield.c2.s8">They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in person, as education had given to their address; and no one would have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c2.s9">There were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny.</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c2.s10">Julia Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older.</s> <s sid="11" id="mansfield.c2.s11">The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c2.s12">Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying.</s> <s sid="13" id="mansfield.c2.s13">Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c2.s14">The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became soon no trifling evil.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c2.s15">In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mansfield.c2.s16"><qs/>"This is not a very promising beginning,"<qe/> said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny had left the room.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c2.s17"><qs/>"After all that I said to her as we came along, I thought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first.</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c2.s18">I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal; but we must make allowances for such a child--and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it _was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c4.p2"><s sid="2" id="mansfield.c4.s2">The earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival at Antigua, after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe, she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others, when Sir Thomas's assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c4.p3"><s sid="3" id="mansfield.c4.s3">The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts continued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments, and looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in addition to all her own household cares, some interference in those of her sister, and Mrs. Grant's wasteful doings to overlook, left her very little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c4.p4"><s sid="4" id="mansfield.c4.s4">The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration.</s> <s sid="5" id="mansfield.c4.s5">Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it, and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour, secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in believing they had no faults.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c4.p6"><s sid="8" id="mansfield.c4.s8">Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt's companion when they called away the rest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c4.s9">She talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillity of such evenings, her perfect security in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any sound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments.</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c4.s10">As to her cousins' gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them.</s> <s sid="11" id="mansfield.c4.s11">Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her; for though it brought no William to England, the never-failing hope of his arrival was worth much.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c4.p8"><s sid="24" id="mansfield.c4.s24">Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help paying more attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking he had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without.</s> <s sid="25" id="mansfield.c4.s25">He had three horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman.</s> <s sid="26" id="mansfield.c4.s26">Two of them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew where such a one was to be met with; and having once made up his mind, the whole business was soon completed.</s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c4.s27">The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose, and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.</s> <s sid="28" id="mansfield.c4.s28">She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund's mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was beyond all her words to express.</s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c4.s29">She regarded her cousin as an example of everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay.</s> <s sid="30" id="mansfield.c4.s30">Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, and tender.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="mansfield.c4.s31">As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny's use; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in September, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and without any near prospect of finishing his business.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c4.s32">Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c4.s33">Tom arrived safely, bringing an excellent account of his father's health; but to very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c4.s34">Sir Thomas's sending away his son seemed to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of her cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.</s> <s sid="35" id="mansfield.c4.s35">The return of winter engagements, however, was not without its effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind became so pleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece, as tolerably to quiet her nerves.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c4.s36"><qs/>"If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married,"<qe/> she very often thought; always when they were in the company of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c4.p10"><s sid="37" id="mansfield.c4.s37">Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c4.s38">He was a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was nothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased with her conquest.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c4.s39">Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father's, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.</s> <s sid="40" id="mansfield.c4.s40">Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit.</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c4.s41">It was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady and herself.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c4.s42">Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry, and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted to make him happy.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c4.s43">Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment, and admired the nice discernment of character which could so well distinguish merit.</s> <s sid="44" id="mansfield.c4.s44">Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all--perfectly faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c4.p11"><s sid="45" id="mansfield.c4.s45">After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c4.p12"><s sid="46" id="mansfield.c4.s46">It was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could be received; but, in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c4.p13" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mansfield.c4.s47">Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business; but no representation of his aunt's could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion.</s> <s sid="48" id="mansfield.c4.s48">He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her happiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from often saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--<qs/>"If this man had not twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c4.p14"><s sid="49" id="mansfield.c4.s49">Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable.</s> <s sid="50" id="mansfield.c4.s50">It was a connexion exactly of the right sort--in the same county, and the same interest--and his most hearty concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible.</s> <s sid="51" id="mansfield.c4.s51">He only conditioned that the marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again looking eagerly forward to.</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c4.s52">He wrote in April, and had strong hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c4.p15"><s sid="53" id="mansfield.c4.s53">Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c4.s54">They were young people of fortune.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c4.s55">The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c4.s56">As children, their sister had been always very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the care of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c4.s57">In their uncle's house they had found a kind home.</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c4.s58">Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else, were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two.</s> <s sid="59" id="mansfield.c4.s59">The Admiral delighted in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months' further trial at her uncle's house, to find another home.</s> <s sid="60" id="mansfield.c4.s60">Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children--having more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some variety at home.</s> <s sid="61" id="mansfield.c4.s61">The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, was highly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c4.p16"><s sid="62" id="mansfield.c4.s62">Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though they arose principally from doubts of her sister's style of living and tone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house, that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations.</s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c4.s63">To anything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the utmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at half an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c4.p17"><s sid="64" id="mansfield.c4.s64">The meeting was very satisfactory on each side.</s> <s sid="65" id="mansfield.c4.s65">Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance.</s> <s sid="66" id="mansfield.c4.s66">Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit for everything else.</s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c4.s67">She was delighted with each, but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister's.</s> <s sid="68" id="mansfield.c4.s68">She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her: she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c4.p18"><s sid="69" id="mansfield.c4.s69">Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them, and not at all displeased either at her sister's early care, or the choice it had fallen on.</s> <s sid="70" id="mansfield.c4.s70">Matrimony was her object, provided she could marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life.</s> <s sid="71" id="mansfield.c4.s71">While she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to think of it seriously.</s> <s sid="72" id="mansfield.c4.s72">The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c5.p2"><s sid="6" id="mansfield.c5.s6">Her brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with a pleasing address.</s> <s sid="7" id="mansfield.c5.s7">The second meeting proved him not so very plain: he was plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his teeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he was plain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with him at the Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody.</s> <s sid="8" id="mansfield.c5.s8">He was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known, and they were equally delighted with him.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c5.s9">Miss Bertram's engagement made him in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen in love with.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c5.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="mansfield.c5.s10">Maria's notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct.</s> <s sid="11" id="mansfield.c5.s11">She did not want to see or understand.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c5.s12"><qs/>"There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man--everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must take care of himself."<qe/></s> <s sid="13" id="mansfield.c5.s13">Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he began with no object but of making them like him.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c5.s14">He did not want them to die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c5.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="mansfield.c5.s15"><qs/>"I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,"<qe/><sls/> said he, as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; <sle/><qs/>"they are very elegant, agreeable girls."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mansfield.c5.s16"><qs/>"So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c5.s17">But you like Julia best."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c5.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="mansfield.c5.s18"><qs/>"Oh yes!</s> <s sid="19" id="mansfield.c5.s19">I like Julia best."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c5.p7" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="mansfield.c5.s20"><qs/>"But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c5.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="mansfield.c5.s21"><qs/>"So I should suppose.</s> <s sid="22" id="mansfield.c5.s22">She has the advantage in every feature, and I prefer her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall always like Julia best, because you order me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="mansfield.c5.s23"><qs/>"I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_ like her best at last."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c5.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="mansfield.c5.s24"><qs/>"Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c5.p11" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mansfield.c5.s25"><qs/>"And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged.</s> <s sid="26" id="mansfield.c5.s26">Remember that, my dear brother.</s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c5.s27">Her choice is made."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c5.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="mansfield.c5.s28"><qs/>"Yes, and I like her the better for it.</s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c5.s29">An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged.</s> <s sid="30" id="mansfield.c5.s30">She is satisfied with herself.</s> <s sid="31" id="mansfield.c5.s31">Her cares are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c5.s32">All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c5.p13" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mansfield.c5.s33"><qs/>"Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it is a great match for her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c5.p14" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mansfield.c5.s34"><qs/>"But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your opinion of your intimate friend.</s> <s sid="35" id="mansfield.c5.s35">_I_ do not subscribe to it.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c5.s36">I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c5.s37">I could see it in her eyes, when he was mentioned.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c5.s38">I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c5.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mansfield.c5.s39"><qs/>"Mary, how shall we manage him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c5.p16" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mansfield.c5.s40"><qs/>"We must leave him to himself, I believe.</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c5.s41">Talking does no good.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c5.s42">He will be taken in at last."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c5.p17" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="mansfield.c5.s43"><qs/>"But I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have him duped; I would have it all fair and honourable."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c5.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mansfield.c5.s44"><qs/>"Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c5.s45">It will do just as well.</s> <s sid="46" id="mansfield.c5.s46">Everybody is taken in at some period or other."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mansfield.c5.p19" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mansfield.c5.s47"><qs/>"Not always in marriage, dear Mary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mansfield.c5.p20" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="mansfield.c5.s48"><qs/>"In marriage especially.</s> <s sid="49" id="mansfield.c5.s49">With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry.</s> <s sid="50" id="mansfield.c5.s50">Look where I will, I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so, when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect most from others, and are least honest themselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mansfield.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mansfield.c5.s51"><qs/>"Ah!</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c5.s52">You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mansfield.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="mansfield.c5.s53"><qs/>"My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but, however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c5.s54">I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c5.s55">What is this but a take in?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mansfield.c5.p23" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="mansfield.c5.s56"><qs/>"My dear child, there must be a little imagination here.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c5.s57">I beg your pardon, but I cannot quite believe you.</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c5.s58">Depend upon it, you see but half.</s> <s sid="59" id="mansfield.c5.s59">You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation.</s> <s sid="60" id="mansfield.c5.s60">There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded observers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mansfield.c5.p24" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="mansfield.c5.s61"><qs/>"Well done, sister!</s> <s sid="62" id="mansfield.c5.s62">I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_.</s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c5.s63">When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in general would be so too.</s> <s sid="64" id="mansfield.c5.s64">It would save me many a heartache."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mansfield.c5.p25" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="mansfield.c5.s65"><qs/>"You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.</s> <s sid="66" id="mansfield.c5.s66">Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in.</s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c5.s67">Stay with us, and we will cure you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mansfield.c5.p26"><s sid="68" id="mansfield.c5.s68">The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.</s> <s sid="69" id="mansfield.c5.s69">Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit.</s> <s sid="70" id="mansfield.c5.s70">He had come, intending to spend only a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was nothing to call him elsewhere.</s> <s sid="71" id="mansfield.c5.s71">It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mansfield.c5.p27"><s sid="72" id="mansfield.c5.s72">The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford's habits made her likely to feel.</s> <s sid="73" id="mansfield.c5.s73">She acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good.</s> <s sid="74" id="mansfield.c5.s74">_He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the eldest was another strong claim.</s> <s sid="75" id="mansfield.c5.s75">She had felt an early presentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best.</s> <s sid="76" id="mansfield.c5.s76">She knew it was her way.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mansfield.c5.p28"><s sid="77" id="mansfield.c5.s77">Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance, and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this.</s> <s sid="78" id="mansfield.c5.s78">Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do.</s> <s sid="79" id="mansfield.c5.s79">She looked about her with due consideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen's seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new furnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man himself--with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter.</s> <s sid="80" id="mansfield.c5.s80">It might do very well; she believed she should accept him; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B---- races.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mansfield.c5.p29"><s sid="81" id="mansfield.c5.s81">These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goings on, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to an early proof.</s> <s sid="82" id="mansfield.c5.s82">Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the eagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mansfield.c5.p30" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="mansfield.c5.s83">And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and what was _her_ opinion of the newcomers?</s> <s sid="84" id="mansfield.c5.s84">Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny.</s> <s sid="85" id="mansfield.c5.s85">In a quiet way, very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford's beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary, she never mentioned _him_.</s> <s sid="86" id="mansfield.c5.s86">The notice, which she excited herself, was to this effect.</s> <s sid="87" id="mansfield.c5.s87"><qs/>"I begin now to understand you all, except Miss Price,"<qe/> said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams.</s> <s sid="88" id="mansfield.c5.s88"><qs/>"Pray, is she out, or is she not?</s> <s sid="89" id="mansfield.c5.s89">I am puzzled.</s> <s sid="90" id="mansfield.c5.s90">She dined at the Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and yet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mansfield.c5.p31" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="mansfield.c5.s91">Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, <qs/>"I believe I know what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question.</s> <s sid="92" id="mansfield.c5.s92">My cousin is grown up.</s> <s sid="93" id="mansfield.c5.s93">She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and not outs are beyond me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mansfield.c5.p32" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="mansfield.c5.s94"><qs/>"And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained.</s> <s sid="95" id="mansfield.c5.s95">The distinction is so broad.</s> <s sid="96" id="mansfield.c5.s96">Manners as well as appearance are, generally speaking, so totally different.</s> <s sid="97" id="mansfield.c5.s97">Till now, I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not.</s> <s sid="98" id="mansfield.c5.s98">A girl not out has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks very demure, and never says a word.</s> <s sid="99" id="mansfield.c5.s99">You may smile, but it is so, I assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is all very proper.</s> <s sid="100" id="mansfield.c5.s100">Girls should be quiet and modest.</s> <s sid="101" id="mansfield.c5.s101">The most objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden.</s> <s sid="102" id="mansfield.c5.s102">They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!</s> <s sid="103" id="mansfield.c5.s103">_That_ is the faulty part of the present system.</s> <s sid="104" id="mansfield.c5.s104">One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing--and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before.</s> <s sid="105" id="mansfield.c5.s105">Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mansfield.c5.p33" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="mansfield.c5.s106"><qs/>"I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at.</s> <s sid="107" id="mansfield.c5.s107">You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mansfield.c5.p34" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="mansfield.c5.s108"><qs/>"No, indeed.</s> <s sid="109" id="mansfield.c5.s109">Miss Anderson!</s> <s sid="110" id="mansfield.c5.s110">I do not know who or what you mean.</s> <s sid="111" id="mansfield.c5.s111">I am quite in the dark.</s> <s sid="112" id="mansfield.c5.s112">But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me what about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mansfield.c5.p35" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="mansfield.c5.s113"><qs/>"Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed on.</s> <s sid="114" id="mansfield.c5.s114">You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an altered young lady.</s> <s sid="115" id="mansfield.c5.s115">You paint too accurately for mistake.</s> <s sid="116" id="mansfield.c5.s116">It was exactly so.</s> <s sid="117" id="mansfield.c5.s117">The Andersons of Baker Street.</s> <s sid="118" id="mansfield.c5.s118">We were speaking of them the other day, you know.</s> <s sid="119" id="mansfield.c5.s119">Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson.</s> <s sid="120" id="mansfield.c5.s120">The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it.</s> <s sid="121" id="mansfield.c5.s121">When Anderson first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.</s> <s sid="122" id="mansfield.c5.s122">I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and a little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away, and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--nothing like a civil answer--she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an air!</s> <s sid="123" id="mansfield.c5.s123">I did not see her again for a twelvemonth.</s> <s sid="124" id="mansfield.c5.s124">She was then _out_.</s> <s sid="125" id="mansfield.c5.s125">I met her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her.</s> <s sid="126" id="mansfield.c5.s126">She came up to me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look.</s> <s sid="127" id="mansfield.c5.s127">I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has heard the story."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mansfield.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="mansfield.c18.s1">Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first.</s> <s sid="2" id="mansfield.c18.s2">Everybody began to have their vexation.</s> <s sid="3" id="mansfield.c18.s3">Edmund had many.</s> <s sid="4" id="mansfield.c18.s4">Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene-painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.</s> <s sid="5" id="mansfield.c18.s5">Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting.</s> <s sid="6" id="mansfield.c18.s6">He had learned his part--all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together, and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c18.p2"><s sid="7" id="mansfield.c18.s7">Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only listener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of most of them.</s> <s sid="8" id="mansfield.c18.s8">_She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his part, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting a prompter through every speech.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c18.s9">She knew, also, that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him:</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c18.s10">_his_ complaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria's avoidance of him, and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.</s> <s sid="11" id="mansfield.c18.s11">So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring something they had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the others.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c18.s12">Everybody had a part either too long or too short; nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c18.p3" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="mansfield.c18.s13">Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to _her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c18.s14">Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c18.s15">As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and taste than Mr. Yates.</s> <s sid="16" id="mansfield.c18.s16">She did not like him as a man, but she must admit him to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many who differed from her.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c18.s17">Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look, and said, <qs/>"Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this?</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c18.s18">For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c18.p4"><s sid="19" id="mansfield.c18.s19">From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth's ever attaining to the knowledge of his two-and-forty speeches became much less.</s> <s sid="20" id="mansfield.c18.s20">As to his ever making anything _tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was not more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter through the rest.</s> <s sid="21" id="mansfield.c18.s21">Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c18.p5"><s sid="22" id="mansfield.c18.s22">Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had; but with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them, as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion.</s> <s sid="23" id="mansfield.c18.s23">The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to have been unfounded.</s> <s sid="24" id="mansfield.c18.s24">She was occasionally useful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c18.p6" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mansfield.c18.s25">There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it--<qs/>"Come, Fanny,"<qe/><sss/> she cried, <sse/><qs/>"these are fine times for you, but you must not be always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at your ease, in this way; I want you here.</s> <s sid="26" id="mansfield.c18.s26">I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak without sending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together.</s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c18.s27">There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice.</s> <s sid="28" id="mansfield.c18.s28">It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do.</s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c18.s29">_You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than _you_, we should not get on very fast."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c18.p7"><s sid="30" id="mansfield.c18.s30">Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c18.p8" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="mansfield.c18.s31"><qs/>"One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is all new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c18.s32">What is the play about, Fanny? you have never told me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c18.p9" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mansfield.c18.s33"><qs/>"Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c18.s34">It is about Lovers' Vows."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c18.p10" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mansfield.c18.s35"><qs/>"I believe,"<qe/><sls/> said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, <sle/><qs/>"there will be three acts rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c18.p11" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mansfield.c18.s36"><qs/>"You had better stay till the curtain is hung,"<qe/><sss/> interposed Mrs. Norris; <sse/><qs/>"the curtain will be hung in a day or two--there is very little sense in a play without a curtain--and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c18.p12"><s sid="37" id="mansfield.c18.s37">Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c18.s38">Fanny did not share her aunt's composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly, and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c18.s39">The whole subject of it was love--a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c18.p13"><s sid="40" id="mansfield.c18.s40">She had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting.</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c18.s41">She did not _believe_ they had yet rehearsed it, even in private.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c18.p14"><s sid="42" id="mansfield.c18.s42">The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny's consideration of it did not become less agitated.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c18.s43">She worked very diligently under her aunt's directions, but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room, that she might have no concern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at once of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth.</s> <s sid="44" id="mansfield.c18.s44">A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c18.p15" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mansfield.c18.s45"><qs/>"Am I right?</s> <s sid="46" id="mansfield.c18.s46">Yes; this is the East room.</s> <s sid="47" id="mansfield.c18.s47">My dear Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c18.p16"><s sid="48" id="mansfield.c18.s48">Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c18.p17" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="mansfield.c18.s49"><qs/>"Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm.</s> <s sid="50" id="mansfield.c18.s50">Allow me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act.</s> <s sid="51" id="mansfield.c18.s51">I have brought my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_ obliged!</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c18.s52">I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--by ourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he _were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two.</s> <s sid="53" id="mansfield.c18.s53">You will be so good, won't you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c18.p18"><s sid="54" id="mansfield.c18.s54">Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give them in a very steady voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mansfield.c18.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mansfield.c18.s55"><qs/>"Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?"<qe/> continued Miss Crawford, opening her book.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c18.s56"><qs/>"Here it is.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c18.s57">I did not think much of it at first--but, upon my word.</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c18.s58">There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and _that_.</s> <s sid="59" id="mansfield.c18.s59">How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?</s> <s sid="60" id="mansfield.c18.s60">Could you do it?</s> <s sid="61" id="mansfield.c18.s61">But then he is your cousin, which makes all the difference.</s> <s sid="62" id="mansfield.c18.s62">You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him, and get on by degrees.</s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c18.s63">You _have_ a look of _his_ sometimes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mansfield.c18.p20" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="mansfield.c18.s64"><qs/>"Have I?</s> <s sid="65" id="mansfield.c18.s65">I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must _read_ the part, for I can say very little of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mansfield.c18.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mansfield.c18.s66"><qs/>"_None_ of it, I suppose.</s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c18.s67">You are to have the book, of course.</s> <s sid="68" id="mansfield.c18.s68">Now for it.</s> <s sid="69" id="mansfield.c18.s69">We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage.</s> <s sid="70" id="mansfield.c18.s70">There--very good school-room chairs, not made for a theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson.</s> <s sid="71" id="mansfield.c18.s71">What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose?</s> <s sid="72" id="mansfield.c18.s72">Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing all over the house.</s> <s sid="73" id="mansfield.c18.s73">Yates is storming away in the dining-room.</s> <s sid="74" id="mansfield.c18.s74">I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick.</s> <s sid="75" id="mansfield.c18.s75">If _they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised.</s> <s sid="76" id="mansfield.c18.s76">By the bye, I looked in upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with me.</s> <s sid="77" id="mansfield.c18.s77">I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as well as I could, by whispering to him, <alt-qs/>'We shall have an excellent Agatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her manner, so completely _maternal_ in her voice and countenance.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="mansfield.c18.s78">Was not that well done of me?</s> <s sid="79" id="mansfield.c18.s79">He brightened up directly.</s> <s sid="80" id="mansfield.c18.s80">Now for my soliloquy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mansfield.c18.p22"><s sid="81" id="mansfield.c18.s81">She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man.</s> <s sid="82" id="mansfield.c18.s82">With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough; and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought a pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mansfield.c18.p23"><s sid="83" id="mansfield.c18.s83">Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _them_.</s> <s sid="84" id="mansfield.c18.s84">He too had his book, and was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to prepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mansfield.c18.p24"><s sid="85" id="mansfield.c18.s85">_She_ could not equal them in their warmth.</s> <s sid="86" id="mansfield.c18.s86">_Her_ spirits sank under the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either.</s> <s sid="87" id="mansfield.c18.s87">They must now rehearse together.</s> <s sid="88" id="mansfield.c18.s88">Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady, not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them.</s> <s sid="89" id="mansfield.c18.s89">She was invested, indeed, with the office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank--she could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she been otherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation.</s> <s sid="90" id="mansfield.c18.s90">She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars.</s> <s sid="91" id="mansfield.c18.s91">To prompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than enough; for she could not always pay attention to the book.</s> <s sid="92" id="mansfield.c18.s92">In watching them she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help.</s> <s sid="93" id="mansfield.c18.s93">It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was thanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise.</s> <s sid="94" id="mansfield.c18.s94">At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other; and when again alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to believe their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.</s> <s sid="95" id="mansfield.c18.s95">Whatever might be its effect, however, she must stand the brunt of it again that very day.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mansfield.c18.p25"><s sid="96" id="mansfield.c18.s96">The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening:</s> <s sid="97" id="mansfield.c18.s97">Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness.</s> <s sid="98" id="mansfield.c18.s98">There seemed a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion.</s> <s sid="99" id="mansfield.c18.s99">Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away.</s> <s sid="100" id="mansfield.c18.s100">All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mansfield.c18.p26"><s sid="101" id="mansfield.c18.s101">They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.</s> <s sid="102" id="mansfield.c18.s102">She could not come.</s> <s sid="103" id="mansfield.c18.s103">Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he had little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mansfield.c18.p28" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="mansfield.c18.s107">Here was disappointment!</s> <s sid="108" id="mansfield.c18.s108">Mrs. Grant's non-attendance was sad indeed.</s> <s sid="109" id="mansfield.c18.s109">Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable amongst them; but _now_ she was absolutely necessary.</s> <s sid="110" id="mansfield.c18.s110">They could not act, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her.</s> <s sid="111" id="mansfield.c18.s111">The comfort of the whole evening was destroyed.</s> <s sid="112" id="mansfield.c18.s112">What was to be done?</s> <s sid="113" id="mansfield.c18.s113">Tom, as Cottager, was in despair.</s> <s sid="114" id="mansfield.c18.s114">After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, <qs/>"If Miss Price would be so good as to _read_ the part."<qe/></s> <s sid="115" id="mansfield.c18.s115">She was immediately surrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, <qs/>"Do, Fanny, if it is not _very_ disagreeable to you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mansfield.c18.p29"><s sid="116" id="mansfield.c18.s116">But Fanny still hung back.</s> <s sid="117" id="mansfield.c18.s117">She could not endure the idea of it.</s> <s sid="118" id="mansfield.c18.s118">Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well?</s> <s sid="119" id="mansfield.c18.s119">Or why had not she rather gone to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of attending the rehearsal at all?</s> <s sid="120" id="mansfield.c18.s120">She had known it would irritate and distress her; she had known it her duty to keep away.</s> <s sid="121" id="mansfield.c18.s121">She was properly punished.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mansfield.c18.p30" type="speech"><s sid="122" id="mansfield.c18.s122"><qs/>"You have only to _read_ the part,"<qe/> said Henry Crawford, with renewed entreaty.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c19.p2" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="mansfield.c19.s9">Julia was the first to move and speak again.</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c19.s10">Jealousy and bitterness had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at the moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soon as she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her words, he still kept his station and retained her sister's hand, her wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she had been white before, she turned out of the room, saying, <qs/>"_I_ need not be afraid of appearing before him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c19.p3" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="mansfield.c19.s11">Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c19.s12">A very few words between them were sufficient.</s> <s sid="13" id="mansfield.c19.s13">The case admitted no difference of opinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c19.s14">Maria joined them with the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c19.s15">Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment, a moment of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and anxiety.</s> <s sid="16" id="mansfield.c19.s16">She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination, and was equal even to encounter her father.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c19.s17">They walked off, utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of, <qs/>"Shall I go too?</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c19.s18">Had not I better go too?</s> <s sid="19" id="mansfield.c19.s19">Will not it be right for me to go too?"<qe/> but they were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with delighted haste.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c19.p4"><s sid="20" id="mansfield.c19.s20">Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates.</s> <s sid="21" id="mansfield.c19.s21">She had been quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas's affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing-time.</s> <s sid="22" id="mansfield.c19.s22">Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering.</s> <s sid="23" id="mansfield.c19.s23">She was nearly fainting: all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him, with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable.</s> <s sid="24" id="mansfield.c19.s24">She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of vexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a most untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c19.p5" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mansfield.c19.s25">The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better understanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue.</s> <s sid="26" id="mansfield.c19.s26">The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for the evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.</s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c19.s27">The Crawfords laughed at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates's accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.</s> <s sid="28" id="mansfield.c19.s28">But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, <qs/>"he preferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c19.p6"><s sid="29" id="mansfield.c19.s29">Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was settled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology, saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c19.p7" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="mansfield.c19.s30">Too soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door; and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in desperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected family, were before her.</s> <s sid="31" id="mansfield.c19.s31">As she entered, her own name caught her ear.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c19.s32">Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, <qs/>"But where is Fanny?</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c19.s33">Why do not I see my little Fanny?"<qe/>--and on perceiving her, came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her, calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown!</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c19.s34">Fanny knew not how to feel, nor where to look.</s> <s sid="35" id="mansfield.c19.s35">She was quite oppressed.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c19.s36">He had never been so kind, so _very_ kind to her in his life.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c19.s37">His manner seemed changed, his voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c19.s38">He led her nearer the light and looked at her again--inquired particularly after her health, and then, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c19.s39">A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty.</s> <s sid="40" id="mansfield.c19.s40">He inquired next after her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c19.p8"><s sid="41" id="mansfield.c19.s41">Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c19.s42">He had the best right to be the talker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house, in the centre of his family, after such a separation, made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage, and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c19.s43">His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool, having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures, were most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him--interrupting himself more than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home--coming unexpectedly as he did--all collected together exactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on.</s> <s sid="44" id="mansfield.c19.s44">Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking had already met him, and with pointed attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c19.s45">There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking him already.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c19.p9"><s sid="46" id="mansfield.c19.s46">By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken, unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to see him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.</s> <s sid="47" id="mansfield.c19.s47">She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work, move Pug from her side, and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.</s> <s sid="48" id="mansfield.c19.s48">She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure: her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence: she had done a great deal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own.</s> <s sid="49" id="mansfield.c19.s49">It was so agreeable to her to see him again, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives, that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him, and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c19.p10" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mansfield.c19.s50">Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister.</s> <s sid="51" id="mansfield.c19.s51">Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for her judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as her brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return.</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c19.s52">It had left her nothing to do.</s> <s sid="53" id="mansfield.c19.s53">Instead of being sent for out of the room, and seeing him first, and having to spread the happy news through the house, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing-room.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c19.s54">Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended, whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c19.s55">Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take nothing, nothing till tea came--he would rather wait for tea.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c19.s56">Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c19.s57"><qs/>"Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea.</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c19.s58">Do have a basin of soup."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c19.p11" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="mansfield.c19.s59">Sir Thomas could not be provoked.</s> <s sid="60" id="mansfield.c19.s60"><qs/>"Still the same anxiety for everybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,"<qe/> was his answer.</s> <s sid="61" id="mansfield.c19.s61"><qs/>"But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c19.p12" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mansfield.c19.s62"><qs/>"Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night."<qe/></s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c19.s63">She carried this point, and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c19.p13" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="mansfield.c19.s64">At length there was a pause.</s> <s sid="65" id="mansfield.c19.s65">His immediate communications were exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now at one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not long: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, <qs/>"How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas?</s> <s sid="66" id="mansfield.c19.s66">They have been acting.</s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c19.s67">We have been all alive with acting."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c19.p14" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="mansfield.c19.s68"><qs/>"Indeed! and what have you been acting?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c19.p15" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mansfield.c19.s69"><qs/>"Oh! they'll tell you all about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c19.p16" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="mansfield.c19.s70"><qs/>"The _all_ will soon be told,"<qe/><sls/> cried Tom hastily, and with affected unconcern; <sle/><qs/>"but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now.</s> <s sid="71" id="mansfield.c19.s71">You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir.</s> <s sid="72" id="mansfield.c19.s72">We have just been trying, by way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle.</s> <s sid="73" id="mansfield.c19.s73">We have had such incessant rains almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together.</s> <s sid="74" id="mansfield.c19.s74">I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd.</s> <s sid="75" id="mansfield.c19.s75">Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting anything since.</s> <s sid="76" id="mansfield.c19.s76">The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.</s> <s sid="77" id="mansfield.c19.s77">I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were.</s> <s sid="78" id="mansfield.c19.s78">_I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year.</s> <s sid="79" id="mansfield.c19.s79">I hope you will take a day's sport there yourself, sir, soon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c19.p17"><s sid="80" id="mansfield.c19.s80">For the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick feelings subsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was returning.</s> <s sid="81" id="mansfield.c19.s81">He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance.</s> <s sid="82" id="mansfield.c19.s82">Edmund was the first to speak--</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c19.p18" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="mansfield.c19.s83"><qs/>"Something must be done,"<qe/> said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mansfield.c19.p19" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="mansfield.c19.s84"><qs/>"It is time to think of our visitors,"<qe/> said Maria, still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart, and caring little for anything else.</s> <s sid="85" id="mansfield.c19.s85"><qs/>"Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mansfield.c19.p20"><s sid="86" id="mansfield.c19.s86">Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mansfield.c19.p21" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="mansfield.c19.s87"><qs/>"Then poor Yates is all alone,"<qe/> cried Tom.</s> <s sid="88" id="mansfield.c19.s88"><qs/>"I will go and fetch him.</s> <s sid="89" id="mansfield.c19.s89">He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mansfield.c19.p22"><s sid="90" id="mansfield.c19.s90">To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the first meeting of his father and his friend.</s> <s sid="91" id="mansfield.c19.s91">Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his eye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture.</s> <s sid="92" id="mansfield.c19.s92">The removal of the bookcase from before the billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther.</s> <s sid="93" id="mansfield.c19.s93">Some one was talking there in a very loud accent; he did not know the voice--more than talking--almost hallooing.</s> <s sid="94" id="mansfield.c19.s94">He stepped to the door, rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication, and, opening it, found himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to knock him down backwards.</s> <s sid="95" id="mansfield.c19.s95">At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance.</s> <s sid="96" id="mansfield.c19.s96">His father's looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates, making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon any account.</s> <s sid="97" id="mansfield.c19.s97">It would be the last--in all probability--the last scene on that stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer.</s> <s sid="98" id="mansfield.c19.s98">The house would close with the greatest eclat.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mansfield.c19.p23" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="mansfield.c19.s99">There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of merriment.</s> <s sid="100" id="mansfield.c19.s100">It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assist the introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best.</s> <s sid="101" id="mansfield.c19.s101">Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character, but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement.</s> <s sid="102" id="mansfield.c19.s102">Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the <qs/>"particular friend,"<qe/> another of the hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearance it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mansfield.c19.p24"><s sid="103" id="mansfield.c19.s103">Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to see, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be some ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity.</s> <s sid="104" id="mansfield.c19.s104">A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mansfield.c19.p25" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="mansfield.c19.s105"><qs/>"I come from your theatre,"<qe/><sls/> said he composedly, as he sat down; <sle/><qs/>"I found myself in it rather unexpectedly.</s> <s sid="106" id="mansfield.c19.s106">Its vicinity to my own room--but in every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character.</s> <s sid="107" id="mansfield.c19.s107">It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit."<qe/></s> <s sid="108" id="mansfield.c19.s108">And then he would have changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir Thomas's meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the topic of the theatre, would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it, and finally would make him hear the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford.</s> <s sid="109" id="mansfield.c19.s109">Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion of Mr. Yates's habits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story; and when it was over, could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mansfield.c19.p26" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="mansfield.c19.s110"><qs/>"This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,"<qe/> said Tom, after a moment's thought.</s> <s sid="111" id="mansfield.c19.s111"><qs/>"My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford, and it spread--as those things always spread, you know, sir--the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly.</s> <s sid="112" id="mansfield.c19.s112">It was like treading old ground again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mansfield.c22.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mansfield.c22.s1">Fanny's consequence increased on the departure of her cousins.</s> <s sid="2" id="mansfield.c22.s2">Becoming, as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to be more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever been before; and <qs/>"Where is Fanny?"<qe/> became no uncommon question, even without her being wanted for any one's convenience.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c22.p2"><s sid="3" id="mansfield.c22.s3">Not only at home did her value increase, but at the Parsonage too.</s> <s sid="4" id="mansfield.c22.s4">In that house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's death, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford.</s> <s sid="5" id="mansfield.c22.s5">Her visits there, beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation.</s> <s sid="6" id="mansfield.c22.s6">Mrs. Grant, really eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the easiest self-deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c22.p3"><s sid="7" id="mansfield.c22.s7">Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her part, to come in.</s> <s sid="8" id="mansfield.c22.s8">A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.</s> <s sid="9" id="mansfield.c22.s9">The value of an event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.</s> <s sid="10" id="mansfield.c22.s10">She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being useful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the rain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c22.p4"><s sid="11" id="mansfield.c22.s11">The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way, and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant's carriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened.</s> <s sid="12" id="mansfield.c22.s12">As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c22.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="mansfield.c22.s13">It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the room, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which could hardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its being in Mansfield.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c22.s14">To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural circumstance.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c22.s15">She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the instrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but Miss Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was concerned at her own neglect; and <qs/>"Shall I play to you now?"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"What will you have?"<qe/> were questions immediately following with the readiest good-humour.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c22.p6"><s sid="16" id="mansfield.c22.s16">She played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener who seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and who shewed herself not wanting in taste.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c22.s17">She played till Fanny's eyes, straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair, spoke what she felt must be done.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c22.p10"><s sid="27" id="mansfield.c22.s27">Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her, with superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself, and glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before; and on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, to take them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the harp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c22.p11"><s sid="28" id="mansfield.c22.s28">Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams' going away--an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something new, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings.</s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c22.s29">Fanny went to her every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could not be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_ often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected.</s> <s sid="30" id="mansfield.c22.s30">She went, however, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant's shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of year, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for warmth.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c22.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="mansfield.c22.s31"><qs/>"This is pretty, very pretty,"<qe/><sls/> said Fanny, looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day; <sle/><qs/>"every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c22.s32">Three years ago, this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field, never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in another three years, we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c22.s33">How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the changes of the human mind!"<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c22.s34">And following the latter train of thought, she soon afterwards added:</s> <s sid="35" id="mansfield.c22.s35"><qs/>"If any one faculty of our nature may be called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c22.s36">There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c22.s37">The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control!</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c22.s38">We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c22.p13"><s sid="39" id="mansfield.c22.s39">Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought must interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mansfield.c24.p23"><s sid="94" id="mansfield.c24.s94">The wish was rather eager than lasting.</s> <s sid="95" id="mansfield.c24.s95">He was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next day's hunting; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.</s> <s sid="96" id="mansfield.c24.s96">In one respect it was better, as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige.</s> <s sid="97" id="mansfield.c24.s97">With spirits, courage, and curiosity up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself, and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to reason away in Fanny.</s> <s sid="98" id="mansfield.c24.s98">She feared for William; by no means convinced by all that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries, of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough horses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the management of a high-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and well, without accident or discredit, could she be reconciled to the risk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce.</s> <s sid="99" id="mansfield.c24.s99">When it was proved, however, to have done William no harm, she could allow it to be a kindness, and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his use again; and the next, with the greatest cordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted, made over to his use entirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c25.p3"><s sid="5" id="mansfield.c25.s5">The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen; and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual style of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c26.p14"><s sid="65" id="mansfield.c26.s65">Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c39.p3"><s sid="12" id="mansfield.c39.s12">William was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could not conceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished.</s> <s sid="13" id="mansfield.c39.s13">It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety.</s> <s sid="14" id="mansfield.c39.s14">Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be.</s> <s sid="15" id="mansfield.c39.s15">She could not respect her parents as she had hoped.</s> <s sid="16" id="mansfield.c39.s16">On her father, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent of his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than she had been prepared for.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c39.s17">He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity, and no information beyond his profession; he read only the newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, the harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he was dirty and gross.</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c39.s18">She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself.</s> <s sid="19" id="mansfield.c39.s19">There had remained only a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he scarcely ever noticed her, but to make her the object of a coarse joke.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c39.p5"><s sid="32" id="mansfield.c39.s32">Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c39.s33">She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs. Norris's inclination for it, or any of her activity.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c39.s34">Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of similar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suited to her capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in.</s> <s sid="35" id="mansfield.c39.s35">She might have made just as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small income.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c39.p6"><s sid="36" id="mansfield.c39.s36">Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c39.s37">She might scruple to make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught nor restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no conversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her better, no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c39.p7"><s sid="38" id="mansfield.c39.s38">Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her home, or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her foreign education, from contributing her help to its comforts, and therefore set about working for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with perseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped off at last, with more than half his linen ready.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c39.s39">She had great pleasure in feeling her usefulness, but could not conceive how they would have managed without her.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c39.p8"><s sid="40" id="mansfield.c39.s40">Sam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted when he went, for he was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any errand in the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as they were, though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed and powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by Fanny's services and gentle persuasions; and she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him:</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c39.s41">Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason, which might suggest the expediency of making friends, and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c39.s42">Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _them_; they were quite untameable by any means of address which she had spirits or time to attempt.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c39.s43">Every afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house; and she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's constant half-holiday.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c39.p9"><s sid="44" id="mansfield.c39.s44">Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she had many doubts.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c39.s45">Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means without provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c39.p10"><s sid="46" id="mansfield.c39.s46">Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings.</s> <s sid="47" id="mansfield.c39.s47">On the contrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates, its happy ways.</s> <s sid="48" id="mansfield.c39.s48">Everything where she now was in full contrast to it.</s> <s sid="49" id="mansfield.c39.s49">The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _here_.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c39.p11"><s sid="50" id="mansfield.c39.s50">The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and nervous like Fanny's, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely atoned for.</s> <s sid="51" id="mansfield.c39.s51">It was the greatest misery of all.</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c39.s52">At Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts, no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody's feelings were consulted.</s> <s sid="53" id="mansfield.c39.s53">If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting, good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, they were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c39.s54">Here everybody was noisy, every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother's, which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram's, only worn into fretfulness).</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c39.s55">Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out their excuses from the kitchen.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c39.s56">The doors were in constant banging, the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command attention when they spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c39.p12"><s sid="57" id="mansfield.c39.s57">In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mansfield.c40.p2"><s sid="30" id="mansfield.c40.s30">There was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it connected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about whom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week.</s> <s sid="31" id="mansfield.c40.s31">Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mansfield.c40.p3"><s sid="32" id="mansfield.c40.s32">As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for deficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father's and mother's acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she saw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness and reserve.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c40.s33">The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert, everybody underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she received from introductions either to old or new acquaintance.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c40.s34">The young ladies who approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her coming from a baronet's family, were soon offended by what they termed "airs"; for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right of superiority.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mansfield.c40.p4"><s sid="35" id="mansfield.c40.s35">The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home, the first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any promise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of being of service to her.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c40.s36">Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself, but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition so totally different from her own.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c40.s37">Susan saw that much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right.</s> <s sid="38" id="mansfield.c40.s38">That a girl of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in the method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c40.s39">Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing the same system, which her own judgment acknowledged, but which her more supine and yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting.</s> <s sid="40" id="mansfield.c40.s40">Susan tried to be useful, where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that Susan was useful she could perceive; that things, bad as they were, would have been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mansfield.c40.p5"><s sid="41" id="mansfield.c40.s41">In every argument with her mother, Susan had in point of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off.</s> <s sid="42" id="mansfield.c40.s42">The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c40.s43">There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mansfield.c40.p6"><s sid="44" id="mansfield.c40.s44">All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c40.s45">That her manner was wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and ill-timed, and her looks and language very often indefensible, Fanny could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they might be rectified.</s> <s sid="46" id="mansfield.c40.s46">Susan, she found, looked up to her and wished for her good opinion; and new as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did resolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself, which her own more favoured education had fixed in her.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c40.p8"><s sid="53" id="mansfield.c40.s53">Her temper was open.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c40.s54">She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for having contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again the blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c40.s55">She gave advice, advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper, and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c40.s56">More was not expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation and expediency of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl like Susan.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c40.s57">Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became--not that Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge--but that so much better knowledge, so many good notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the midst of negligence and error, she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c40.p10"><s sid="69" id="mansfield.c40.s69">In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might be useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London, whither, on the authority of her aunt's last letter, she knew he was gone.</s> <s sid="70" id="mansfield.c40.s70">She had no doubt of what would ensue.</s> <s sid="71" id="mansfield.c40.s71">The promised notification was hanging over her head.</s> <s sid="72" id="mansfield.c40.s72">The postman's knock within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish the idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mansfield.c41.p7"><s sid="16" id="mansfield.c41.s16">They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish.</s> <s sid="17" id="mansfield.c41.s17">She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life; and was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable as he was, he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of going over to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard.</s> <s sid="18" id="mansfield.c41.s18">Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the employment of wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth.</s> <s sid="19" id="mansfield.c41.s19">He had reached it late the night before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mansfield.c41.p8"><s sid="20" id="mansfield.c41.s20">By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mansfield.c41.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="mansfield.c41.s21">Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance; nay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and the words, <qs/>"then by this time it is all settled,"<qe/> passed internally, without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mansfield.c41.p10" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mansfield.c41.s22">After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk.</s> <s sid="23" id="mansfield.c41.s23">"It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise"; and such hints producing nothing, he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time.</s> <s sid="24" id="mansfield.c41.s24">Now they came to an understanding.</s> <s sid="25" id="mansfield.c41.s25">Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of doors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her large family, find time for a walk.</s> <s sid="26" id="mansfield.c41.s26"><qs/>"Would she not, then, persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure of attending them?"<qe/></s> <s sid="27" id="mansfield.c41.s27">Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.</s> <s sid="28" id="mansfield.c41.s28"><qs/>"Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the town, which they would be very glad to do."<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="mansfield.c41.s29">And the consequence was, that Fanny, strange as it was--strange, awkward, and distressing--found herself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mansfield.c41.p11"><s sid="30" id="mansfield.c41.s30">It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father, whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday.</s> <s sid="31" id="mansfield.c41.s31">He stopt; and, ungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford.</s> <s sid="32" id="mansfield.c41.s32">She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck.</s> <s sid="33" id="mansfield.c41.s33">He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether.</s> <s sid="34" id="mansfield.c41.s34">He must soon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mansfield.c41.p12"><s sid="35" id="mansfield.c41.s35">Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger, from what he was in his own family at home.</s> <s sid="36" id="mansfield.c41.s36">His manners now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful, animated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached father, and a sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open air, and there was not a single oath to be heard.</s> <s sid="37" id="mansfield.c41.s37">Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it might, Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mansfield.c41.p13"><s sid="38" id="mansfield.c41.s38">The conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer of Mr. Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford, desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow or other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they were not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without the smallest consideration for his daughters' errands in the High Street.</s> <s sid="39" id="mansfield.c41.s39">He took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number of three-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to proceed.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mansfield.c41.p14" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mansfield.c41.s40">They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk would have been conducted--according to Mr. Crawford's opinion--in a singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it, as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and keep up with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together at their own hasty pace.</s> <s sid="41" id="mansfield.c41.s41">He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally, though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely would not walk away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr. Price was only calling out, <qs/>"Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!"<qe/> he would give them his particular attendance.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mansfield.c41.p15"><s sid="42" id="mansfield.c41.s42">Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price's, who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing interest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at.</s> <s sid="43" id="mansfield.c41.s43">Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest.</s> <s sid="44" id="mansfield.c41.s44">Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he could have wished her sister away.</s> <s sid="45" id="mansfield.c41.s45">A quick-looking girl of Susan's age was the very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady Bertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point before her.</s> <s sid="46" id="mansfield.c41.s46">He must content himself with being only generally agreeable, and letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.</s> <s sid="47" id="mansfield.c41.s47">Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he had been some time, and everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes.</s> <s sid="48" id="mansfield.c41.s48">Such a man could come from no place, no society, without importing something to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her.</s> <s sid="49" id="mansfield.c41.s49">For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in.</s> <s sid="50" id="mansfield.c41.s50">For her approbation, the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given.</s> <s sid="51" id="mansfield.c41.s51">It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and--he believed--industrious family was at stake.</s> <s sid="52" id="mansfield.c41.s52">He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had determined to go himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case.</s> <s sid="53" id="mansfield.c41.s53">He had gone, had done even more good than he had foreseen, had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind.</s> <s sid="54" id="mansfield.c41.s54">He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him.</s> <s sid="55" id="mansfield.c41.s55">This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny.</s> <s sid="56" id="mansfield.c41.s56">It was pleasing to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting as he ought to do.</s> <s sid="57" id="mansfield.c41.s57">To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed!</s> <s sid="58" id="mansfield.c41.s58">Nothing could be more grateful to her; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look, when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mansfield.c41.p16"><s sid="59" id="mansfield.c41.s59">She turned away, and wished he would not say such things.</s> <s sid="60" id="mansfield.c41.s60">She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wont to suppose.</s> <s sid="61" id="mansfield.c41.s61">She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her, and ought not to think of her.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mansfield.c41.p17"><s sid="62" id="mansfield.c41.s62">He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would be as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield.</s> <s sid="63" id="mansfield.c41.s63">He could not have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly.</s> <s sid="64" id="mansfield.c41.s64">It was a real indulgence to her to hear or to speak of Mansfield.</s> <s sid="65" id="mansfield.c41.s65">Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it, and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mansfield.c41.p18"><s sid="66" id="mansfield.c41.s66">He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so; he looked forward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there; always there, or in the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="67" id="mansfield.c41.s67">He particularly built upon a very happy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so: he depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last.</s> <s sid="68" id="mansfield.c41.s68">As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of superiority undescribable.</s> </p>
