<title>BOOK 1.</title>
<p pid="1" id="enchanted.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="enchanted.c1.s1">There were three of them Jerry, Jimmy, and Kathleen.</s> <s sid="2" id="enchanted.c1.s2">Of course, Jerry's name was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever you may think; and Jimmy's name was James; and Kathleen was never called by her name at all, but Cathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when her brothers were pleased with her, and Scratch Cat when they were not pleased.</s> <s sid="3" id="enchanted.c1.s3">And they were at school in a little town in the West of England the boys at one school, of course, and the girl at another, because the sensible habit of having boys and girls at the same school is not yet as common as I hope it will be some day.</s> <s sid="4" id="enchanted.c1.s4">They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays at the house of a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses where it is impossible to play.</s> <s sid="5" id="enchanted.c1.s5">You know the kind of house, don't you?</s> <s sid="6" id="enchanted.c1.s6">There is a sort of a something about that kind of house that makes you hardly able even to talk to each other when you are left alone, and playing seems unnatural and affected.</s> <s sid="7" id="enchanted.c1.s7">So they looked forward to the holidays, when they should all go home and be together all day long, in a house where playing was natural and conversation possible, and where the Hampshire forests and fields were full of interesting things to do and see.</s> <s sid="8" id="enchanted.c1.s8">Their Cousin Betty was to be there too, and there were plans.</s> <s sid="9" id="enchanted.c1.s9">Betty's school broke up before theirs, and so she got to the Hampshire home first, and the moment she got there she began to have measles, so that my three couldn't go home at all.</s> <s sid="10" id="enchanted.c1.s10">You may imagine their feelings.</s> <s sid="11" id="enchanted.c1.s11">The thought of seven weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne, and all three wrote home and said so.</s> <s sid="12" id="enchanted.c1.s12">This astonished their parents very much, because they had always thought it was so nice for the children to have dear Miss Hervey's to go to.</s> <s sid="13" id="enchanted.c1.s13">However, they were "jolly decent about it , as Jerry said, and after a lot of letters and telegrams, it was arranged that the boys should go and stay at Kathleen's school, where there were now no girls left and no mistresses except the French one.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="enchanted.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="enchanted.c1.s14"><qs/>"It'll be better than being at Miss Hervey's,"<qe/><sls/> said Kathleen, when the boys came round to ask Mademoiselle when it would be convenient for them to come; <sle/><qs/>"and, besides, our school's not half so ugly as yours.</s> <s sid="15" id="enchanted.c1.s15">We do have tablecloths on the tables and curtains at the windows, and yours is all deal boards, and desks, and inkiness."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="enchanted.c1.p3"><s sid="16" id="enchanted.c1.s16">When they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the rooms as pretty as she could with flowers in jam jars marigolds chiefly, because there was nothing much else in the back garden.</s> <s sid="17" id="enchanted.c1.s17">There were geraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and lobelias; of course, the children were not allowed to pick these.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="enchanted.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="enchanted.c1.s18"><qs/>"We ought to have some sort of play to keep us going through the holidays,"<qe/> said Kathleen, when tea was over, and she had unpacked and arranged the boys clothes in the painted chests of drawers, feeling very grown-up and careful as she neatly laid the different sorts of clothes in tidy little heaps in the drawers.</s> <s sid="19" id="enchanted.c1.s19"><qs/>"Suppose we write a book."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="enchanted.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="enchanted.c1.s20"><qs/>"You couldn't,"<qe/> said Jimmy.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="enchanted.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="enchanted.c1.s21"><qs/>"I didn't mean me, of course,"<qe/><sls/> said Kathleen, a little injured; <sle/><qs/>"I meant us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="enchanted.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="enchanted.c1.s22"><qs/>"Too much fag,"<qe/> said Gerald briefly.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="enchanted.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="enchanted.c1.s23"><qs/>"If we wrote a book,"<qe/><sss/> Kathleen persisted, <sse/><qs/>"about what the insides of schools really are like, people would read it and say how clever we were."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="enchanted.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="enchanted.c1.s24"><qs/>"More likely expel us,"<qe/> said Gerald.</s> <s sid="25" id="enchanted.c1.s25"><qs/>"No; we'll have an out-of-doors game bandits, or something like that.</s> <s sid="26" id="enchanted.c1.s26">It wouldn't be bad if we could get a cave and keep stores in it, and have our meals there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="enchanted.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="enchanted.c1.s27"><qs/>"There aren't any caves,"<qe/> said Jimmy, who was fond of contradicting everyone.</s> <s sid="28" id="enchanted.c1.s28"><qs/>"And, besides, your precious Mamselle won't let us go out alone, as likely as not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="enchanted.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="enchanted.c1.s29"><qs/>"Oh, we'll see about that,"<qe/> said Gerald.</s> <s sid="30" id="enchanted.c1.s30"><qs/>"I'll go and talk to her like a father."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="enchanted.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="enchanted.c1.s31"><qs/>"Like that?"<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="enchanted.c1.s32">Kathleen pointed the thumb of scorn at him, and he looked in the glass.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="enchanted.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="enchanted.c1.s33"><qs/>"To brush his hair and his clothes and to wash his face and hands was to our hero but the work of a moment,"<qe/> said Gerald, and went to suit the action to the word.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="enchanted.c1.p14"><s sid="34" id="enchanted.c1.s34">It was a very sleek boy, brown and thin and interesting-looking, that knocked at the door of the parlour where Mademoiselle sat reading a yellow-covered book and wishing vain wishes.</s> <s sid="35" id="enchanted.c1.s35">Gerald could always make himself look interesting at a moment's notice, a very useful accomplishment in dealing with strange grown-ups.</s> <s sid="36" id="enchanted.c1.s36">It was done by opening his grey eyes rather wide, allowing the corners of his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy who must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="enchanted.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="enchanted.c1.s37"><qs/>"Entrez!"<qe/> said Mademoiselle, in shrill French accents.</s> <s sid="38" id="enchanted.c1.s38">So he entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="enchanted.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="enchanted.c1.s39"><qs/>"Eh bien?"<qe/> she said rather impatiently.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="enchanted.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="enchanted.c1.s40"><qs/>"I hope I am not disturbing you,"<qe/> said Gerald, in whose mouth, it seemed, butter would not have melted.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="enchanted.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="enchanted.c1.s41"><qs/>"But no,"<qe/> she said, somewhat softened.</s> <s sid="42" id="enchanted.c1.s42"><qs/>"What is it that you desire?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="enchanted.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="enchanted.c1.s43"><qs/>"I thought I ought to come and say how do you do,"<qe/><sss/> said Gerald, <sse/><qs/>"because of you being the lady of the house."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="enchanted.c1.p20"><s sid="44" id="enchanted.c1.s44">He held out the newly-washed hand, still damp and red.</s> <s sid="45" id="enchanted.c1.s45">She took it.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="enchanted.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="enchanted.c1.s46"><qs/>"You are a very polite little boy,"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="enchanted.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="enchanted.c1.s47"><qs/>"Not at all,"<qe/> said Gerald, more polite than ever.</s> <s sid="48" id="enchanted.c1.s48"><qs/>"I am so sorry for you.</s> <s sid="49" id="enchanted.c1.s49">It must be dreadful to have us to look after in the holidays."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="enchanted.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="enchanted.c1.s50"><qs/>"But not at all,"<qe/> said Mademoiselle in her turn.</s> <s sid="51" id="enchanted.c1.s51"><qs/>"I am sure you will be very good childrens."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="enchanted.c1.p24"><s sid="52" id="enchanted.c1.s52">Gerald's look assured her that he and the others would be as near angels as children could be without ceasing to be human."We'll try," he said earnestly.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="enchanted.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="enchanted.c1.s53"><qs/>"Can one do anything for you?"<qe/> asked the French governess kindly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="enchanted.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="enchanted.c1.s54"><qs/>"Oh, no, thank you,"<qe/> said Gerald.</s> <s sid="55" id="enchanted.c1.s55"><qs/>"We don't want to give you any trouble at all.</s> <s sid="56" id="enchanted.c1.s56">And I was thinking it would be less trouble for you if we were to go out into the woods all day tomorrow and take our dinner with us something cold, you know so as not to be a trouble to the cook."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="enchanted.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="enchanted.c1.s57"><qs/>"You are very considerate,"<qe/> said Mademoiselle coldly.</s> <s sid="58" id="enchanted.c1.s58">Then Gerald's eyes smiled; they had a trick of doing this when his lips were quite serious.</s> <s sid="59" id="enchanted.c1.s59">Mademoiselle caught the twinkle, and she laughed and Gerald laughed too.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="enchanted.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="enchanted.c1.s60"><qs/>"Little deceiver!"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="61" id="enchanted.c1.s61"><qs/>"Why not say at once you want to be free of surveillance, how you say overwatching without pretending it is me you wish to please?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="enchanted.c1.p29"><s sid="62" id="enchanted.c1.s62">"You have to be careful with grown-ups, " said Gerald, "but it isn't all pretence either.</s> <s sid="63" id="enchanted.c1.s63">We don't want to trouble you and we don't want you to "</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="enchanted.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="enchanted.c1.s67"><qs/>"Oh, yes,"<qe/> said Gerald truthfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="enchanted.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="enchanted.c1.s71"><qs/>"Rather!"<qe/> said Gerald.</s> <s sid="72" id="enchanted.c1.s72"><qs/>"Mademoiselle, you are a dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="enchanted.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="enchanted.c1.s79"><qs/>"Well, what luck?"<qe/> the others asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="enchanted.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="enchanted.c1.s80"><qs/>"It's all right,"<qe/> said Gerald indifferently.</s> <s sid="81" id="enchanted.c1.s81"><qs/>"I told you it would be.</s> <s sid="82" id="enchanted.c1.s82">The ingenuous youth won the regard of the foreign governess, who in her youth had been the beauty of her humble village."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="enchanted.c1.p43"><s sid="92" id="enchanted.c1.s92">Mademoiselle, less stern than Kathleen had ever seen her, presided at supper, which was bread and treacle spread several hours before, and now harder and drier than any other food you can think of.</s> <s sid="93" id="enchanted.c1.s93">Gerald was very polite in handing her butter and cheese, and pressing her to taste the bread and treacle.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="enchanted.c1.p46"><s sid="97" id="enchanted.c1.s97">She laughed, but there was no more dried bread and treacle for supper after that.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="enchanted.c1.p49"><s sid="102" id="enchanted.c1.s102">Next morning Gerald got up early and gathered a little bunch of pink carnations from a plant which he found hidden among the marigolds.</s> <s sid="103" id="enchanted.c1.s103">He tied it up with black cotton and laid it on Mademoiselle's plate.</s> <s sid="104" id="enchanted.c1.s104">She smiled and looked quite handsome as she stuck the flowers in her belt.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="enchanted.c1.p51" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="enchanted.c1.s106"><qs/>"It's not that,"<qe/> said Kathleen suddenly.</s> <s sid="107" id="enchanted.c1.s107"><qs/>"I know what Gerald means, only I never think of the things in time myself.</s> <s sid="108" id="enchanted.c1.s108">You see, if you want grown-ups to be nice to you the least you can do is to be nice to them and think of little things to please them.</s> <s sid="109" id="enchanted.c1.s109">I never think of any myself.</s> <s sid="110" id="enchanted.c1.s110">Jerry does; that's why all the old ladies like him.</s> <s sid="111" id="enchanted.c1.s111">It's not bribery.</s> <s sid="112" id="enchanted.c1.s112">It's a sort of honesty like paying for things."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="enchanted.c1.p52" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="enchanted.c1.s113"><qs/>"Well, anyway,"<qe/><sls/> said Jimmy, putting away the moral question, <sle/><qs/>"we've got a ripping day for the woods."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="enchanted.c1.p54"><s sid="115" id="enchanted.c1.s115">The wide High Street, even at the busy morning hour almost as quiet as a dream-street, lay bathed in sunshine; the leaves shone fresh from last night's rain, but the road was dry, and in the sunshine the very dust of it sparkled like diamonds.</s> <s sid="116" id="enchanted.c1.s116">The beautiful old houses, standing stout and strong, looked as though they were basking in the sunshine and enjoying it.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="enchanted.c1.p55" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="enchanted.c1.s117"><qs/>"But are there any woods?"<qe/> asked Kathleen as they passed the market-place.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="enchanted.c1.p56" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="enchanted.c1.s118"><qs/>"It doesn't much matter about woods,"<qe/><sss/> said Gerald dreamily, <sse/><qs/>"we're sure to find something.</s> <s sid="119" id="enchanted.c1.s119">One of the chaps told me his father said when he was a boy there used to be a little cave under the bank in a lane near the Salisbury Road; but he said there was an enchanted castle there too, so perhaps the cave isn't true either."<qe/></s> <s sid="120" id="enchanted.c1.s120"><qs/>"If we were to get horns,"<qe/><sss/> said Kathleen, <sse/><qs/>"and to blow them very hard all the way, we might find a magic castle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="enchanted.c1.p57" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="enchanted.c1.s121"><qs/>"If you've got the money to throw away on horns..."<qe/> said Jimmy contemptuously.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="enchanted.c1.p59"><s sid="124" id="enchanted.c1.s124">And the quiet square at the end of the town where the church is, and the houses of the most respectable people, echoed to the sound of horns blown long and loud.</s> <s sid="125" id="enchanted.c1.s125">But none of the houses turned into enchanted castles.</s> <s sid="126" id="enchanted.c1.s126">Away they went along the Salisbury Road, which was very hot and dusty, so they agreed to drink one of the bottles of ginger-beer.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="enchanted.c1.p60" type="speech"><s sid="127" id="enchanted.c1.s127"><qs/>"We might as well carry the ginger-beer inside us as inside the bottle,"<qe/> said Jimmy, "and we can hide the bottle and call for it as we come back.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="enchanted.c1.p61"><s sid="128" id="enchanted.c1.s128">Presently they came to a place where the road, as Gerald said, went two ways at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="enchanted.c1.p62" type="speech"><s sid="129" id="enchanted.c1.s129"><qs/>"That looks like adventures,"<qe/><sls/> said Kathleen; and they took the right-hand road, and the next time they took a turning it was a left-hand one, <sle/><qs/>"so as to be quite fair,"<qe/> Jimmy said, and then a right-hand one and then a left, and so on, till they were completely lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="enchanted.c1.p63" type="speech"><s sid="130" id="enchanted.c1.s130"><qs/>"Completely,"<qe/><sss/> said Kathleen; <sse/><qs/>"how jolly!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="enchanted.c1.p64"><s sid="131" id="enchanted.c1.s131">And now trees arched overhead, and the banks of the road were high and bushy.</s> <s sid="132" id="enchanted.c1.s132">The adventurers had long since ceased to blow their horns.</s> <s sid="133" id="enchanted.c1.s133">It was too tiring to go on doing that, when there was no one to be annoyed by it.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="enchanted.c1.p65" type="speech"><s sid="134" id="enchanted.c1.s134"><qs/>"Oh, kriky!"<qe/><sss/> observed Jimmy suddenly, <sse/><qs/>"let's sit down a bit and have some of our dinner.</s> <s sid="135" id="enchanted.c1.s135">We might call it lunch, you know,"<qe/> he added persuasively.</s> </p>
