<title>The Dove in the Eagle's Nest</title>

<p pid="1" id="dove.c0.p1"><s>INTRODUCTION.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dove.c0.p2"><s>IN sending forth this little book, I am inclined to add a few explanatory words as to the use I have made of historical personages.</s> <s>The origin of the whole story was probably Freytag's first series of pictures of German Life: probably, I say, for its first commencement was a dream, dreamt some weeks after reading that most interesting collection of sketches.</s> <s>The return of the squire with the tidings of the death of the two knights was vividly depicted in sleep; and, though without local habitation or name, the scene was most likely to have been a reflection from the wild scenes so lately read of.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dove.c0.p3"><s>In fact, waking thoughts decided that such a catastrophe could hardly have happened anywhere but in Germany, or in Scotland; and the contrast between the cultivation in the free cities and the savagery of the independent barons made the former the more suitable region for the adventures.</s> <s>The time could only be before the taming and bringing into order of the empire, when the Imperial cities were in their greatest splendour, the last free nobles in course of being reduced from their lawless liberty, and the House of Austria beginning to acquire its preponderance over the other princely families.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dove.c0.p4"><s>M. Freytag's books, and Hegewisch's History of Maximilian, will, I think, be found fully to bear out the picture I have tried to give of the state of things in the reign of the Emperor Friedrich III., when, for want of any other law, _Faust recht_, or fist right, ruled; _i.e._ an offended nobleman, having once sent a _Fehde-brief_ to his adversary, was thenceforth at liberty to revenge himself by a private war, in which, for the wrong inflicted, no justice was exacted.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dove.c0.p5"><s>Hegewisch remarks that the only benefit of this custom was, that the honour of subscribing a feud-brief was so highly esteemed that it induced the nobles to learn to write!</s> <s>The League of St.</s> <s>George and the Swabian League were the means of gradually putting down this authorized condition of deadly feud.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dove.c0.p6"><s>This was in the days of Maximilian's youth.</s> <s>He is a prince who seems to have been almost as inferior in his foreign to what he was in his domestic policy as was Queen Elizabeth.</s> <s>He is chiefly familiar to us as failing to keep up his authority in Flanders after the death of Mary of Burgundy, as lingering to fulfil his engagement with Anne of Brittany till he lost her and her duchy, as incurring ridicule by his ill-managed schemes in Italy, and the vast projects that he was always forming without either means or steadiness to carry them out, by his perpetual impecuniosity and slippery dealing; and in his old age he has become rather the laughing-stock of historians.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dove.c0.p7"><s>But there is much that is melancholy in the sight of a man endowed with genius, unbalanced by the force of character that secures success, and with an ardent nature whose intention overleapt obstacles that in practice he found insuperable.</s> <s>At home Maximilian raised the Imperial power from a mere cipher to considerable weight.</s> <s>We judge him as if he had been born in the purple and succeeded to a defined power like his descendants.</s> <s>We forget that the head of the Holy Roman Empire had been, ever since the extinction of the Swabian line, a mere mark for ambitious princes to shoot at, with everything expected from him, and no means to do anything.</s> <s>Maximilian's own father was an avaricious, undignified old man, not until near his death Archduke of even all Austria, and with anarchy prevailing everywhere under his nominal rule.</s> <s>It was in the time of Maximilian that the Empire became as compact and united a body as could be hoped of anything so unwieldy, that law was at least acknowledged, _Faust recht_ for ever abolished, and the Emperor became once more a real power.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dove.c0.p8"><s>The man under whom all this was effected could have been no fool; yet, as he said himself, he reigned over a nation of kings, who each chose to rule for himself; and the uncertainty of supplies of men or money to be gained from them made him so often fail necessarily in his engagements, that he acquired a shiftiness and callousness to breaches of promise, which became the worst flaw in his character.</s> <s>But of the fascination of his manner there can be no doubt.</s> <s>Even Henry VIII.'s English ambassadors, when forced to own how little they could depend on him, and how dangerous it was to let subsidies pass through his fingers, still show themselves under a sort of enchantment of devotion to his person, and this in his old age, and when his conduct was most inexcusable and provoking.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dove.c0.p9" type="speech"><s>His variety of powers was wonderful.</s> <s>He was learned in many languages--in all those of his empire or hereditary states, and in many besides; and he had an ardent love of books, both classical and modern.</s> <s>He delighted in music, painting, architecture, and many arts of a more mechanical description; wrote treatises on all these, and on other subjects, especially gardening and gunnery.</s> <s>He was the inventor of an improved lock to the arquebus, and first divined how to adapt the disposition of his troops to the use of the newly-discovered fire-arms.</s> <s>And in all these things his versatile head and ready hand were personally employed, not by deputy; while coupled with so much artistic taste was a violent passion for hunting, which carried him through many hairbreadth 'scapes.</s> <s>"It was plain,<qs/>" he used to say, "<qe/>that God Almighty ruled the world, or how could things go on with a rogue like Alexander VI. at the head of the Church, and a mere huntsman like himself at the head of the Empire."</s> <s>His _bon-mots_ are numerous, all thoroughly characteristic, and showing that brilliancy in conversation must have been one of his greatest charms.</s> <s>It seems as if only self-control and resolution were wanting to have made him a Charles, or an Alfred, the Great.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dove.c0.p10"><s>The romance of his marriage with the heiress of Burgundy is one of the best known parts of his life.</s> <s>He was scarcely two-and-twenty when he lost her, who perhaps would have given him the stability he wanted; but his tender hove for her endured through life.</s> <s>It is not improbable that it was this still abiding attachment that made him slack in overcoming difficulties in the way of other contracts, and that he may have hoped that his engagement to Bianca Sforza would come to nothing, like so many others.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dove.c0.p11"><s>The most curious record of him is, however, in two books, the materials for which he furnished, and whose composition and illustration he superintended, _Der Weise King_, and _Theurdank_, of both of which he is well known to be the hero.</s> <s>The White, or the Wise King, it is uncertain which, is a history of his education and exploits, in prose.</s> <s>Every alternate page has its engraving, showing how the Young White King obtains instruction in painting, architecture, language, and all arts and sciences, the latter including magic--which he learns of an old woman with a long-tailed demon sitting, like Mother Hubbard's cat, on her shoulder--and astrology.</s> <s>In the illustration of this study an extraordinary figure of a cross within a circle appears in the sky, which probably has some connection with his scheme of nativity, for it also appears on the breast of Ehrenhold, his constant companion in the metrical history of his career, under the name of Theurdank.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dove.c0.p12" type="speech"><s>The poetry of _Theurdank_ was composed by Maximilian's old writing-master, Melchior Pfinznig; but the adventures were the Kaisar's own, communicated by himself, and he superintended the wood-cuts.</s> <s>The name is explained to mean <qs/>"craving glory,"<qe/>--Gloriaememor.</s> <s>The Germans laugh to scorn a French translator, who rendered it <qs/>"Chermerci."<qe/></s> <s>It was annotated very soon after its publication, and each exploit explained and accounted for.</s> <s>It is remarkable and touching in a man who married at eighteen, and was a widower at twenty-two, that, in both books, the happy union with his lady love is placed at the end--not at the beginning of the book; and in _Theurdank_, at least, the eternal reunion is clearly meant.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dove.c0.p13"><s>In this curious book, Konig Romreich, by whom every contemporary understood poor Charles of Burgundy--thus posthumously made King of Rome by Maximilian, as the only honour in his power, betroths his daughter Ehrenreich (rich in honour) to the Ritter Theurdank.</s> <s>Soon after, by a most mild version of Duke Charles's frightful end, Konig Romreich is seen on his back dying in a garden, and Ehrenreich (as Mary really did) despatches a ring to summon her betrothed.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dove.c0.p14"><s>But here Theurdank returns for answer that he means first to win honour by his exploits, and sets out with his comrade, Ehrenhold, in search thereof.</s> <s>Ehrenhold never appears of the smallest use to him in any of the dire adventures into which he falls, but only stands complacently by, and in effect may represent Fame, or perhaps that literary sage whom Don Quixote always supposed to be at hand to record his deeds of prowess.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dove.c0.p15" type="speech"><s>Next we are presented with the German impersonation of Satan as a wise old magician, only with claws instead of feet, commissioning his three captains (_hauptleutern_), Furwitz, Umfallo, and Neidelhard, to beset and ruin Theurdank.</s> <s>They are interpreted as the dangers of youth, middle life, and old age--Rashness, Disaster, and Distress (or Envy).</s> <s>One at a time they encounter him,--not once, but again and again; and he has ranged under each head, in entire contempt of real order of time, the perils he thinks owing to each foe.</s> <s>Furwitz most justly gets the credit of Maximilian's perils on the steeple of Ulm, though, unfortunately, the artist has represented the daring climber as standing not much above the shoulders of Furwitz and Ehrenhold; and although the annotation tells us that his <qs/>"hinder half foot"<qe/> overhung the scaffold, the danger in the print is not appalling.</s> <s>Furwitz likewise inveigles him into putting the point (_schnabel_) of his shoe into the wheel of a mill for turning stone balls, where he certainly hardly deserved to lose nothing but the beak of his shoe.</s> <s>This enemy also brings him into numerous unpleasant predicaments on precipices, where he hangs by one hand; while the chamois stand delighted on every available peak, Furwitz grins malevolently, and Ehrenhold stands pointing at him over his shoulder.</s> <s>Time and place are given in the notes for all these escapes.</s> <s>After some twenty adventures Furwitz is beaten off, and Umfallo tries his powers.</s> <s>Here the misadventures do not involve so much folly on the hero's part--though, to be sure, he ventures into a lion's den unarmed, and has to beat off the inmates with a shovel.</s> <s>But the other adventures are more rational.</s> <s>He catches a jester--of admirably foolish expression--putting a match to a powder-magazine; he is wonderfully preserved in mountain avalanches and hurricanes; reins up his horse on the verge of an abyss; falls through ice in Holland and shows nothing but his head above it; cures himself of a fever by draughts of water, to the great disgust of his physicians, and escapes a fire bursting out of a tall stove.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dove.c0.p16"><s>Neidelhard brings his real battles and perils.</s> <s>From this last he is in danger of shipwreck, of assassination, of poison, in single combat, or in battle; tumults of the people beset him; he is imprisoned as at Ghent.</s> <s>But finally Neidelhard is beaten back; and the hero is presented to Ehrenreich.</s> <s>Ehrenhold recounts his triumphs, and accuses the three captains.</s> <s>One is hung, another beheaded, the third thrown headlong from a tower, and a guardian angel then summons Theurdank to his union with his Queen.</s> <s>No doubt this reunion was the life-dream of the harassed, busy, inconsistent man, who flashed through the turmoils of the early sixteenth century.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dove.c0.p17"><s>The adventures of Maximilian which have been adverted to in the story are all to be found in Theurdank, and in his early life he was probably the brilliant eager person we have tried in some degree to describe.</s> <s>In his latter years it is well known that he was much struck by Luther's arguments; and, indeed, he had long been conscious of need of Church reform, though his plans took the grotesque form of getting himself made Pope, and taking all into his own hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dove.c0.p18"><s>Perhaps it was unwise to have ever so faintly sketched Ebbo's career through the ensuing troubles; but the history of the star and of the spark in the stubble seemed to need completion; and the working out of the character of the survivor was unfinished till his course had been thought over from the dawn of the Wittenberg teaching, which must have seemed no novelty to an heir of the doctrine of Tauler, and of the veritably Catholic divines of old times.</s> <s>The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful, refined, conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation, glad of the hope of cleansing the Church, but hoping to cleanse, not to break away from her--a hope that Luther himself long cherished, and which was not entirely frustrated till the re-assembly at Trent in the next generation.</s> <s>Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made.</s> <s>Their loyalty has been treated as blindness, timidity, or superstition; but that there were many such persons, and those among the very highest minds of their time, no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony, of Erasmus, of Vittoria Colonna, or of Cardinal Giustiniani.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I. MASTER GOTTFRIED'S WORKSHOP</title>
<p pid="1" id="dove.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="dove.c1.s1">THE upper lattices of a tall, narrow window were open, and admitted the view, of first some richly-tinted vine leaves and purpling grapes, then, in dazzling freshness of new white stone, the lacework fabric of a half-built minster spire, with a mason's crane on the summit, bending as though craving for a further supply of materials; and beyond, peeping through every crevice of the exquisite open fretwork, was the intensely blue sky of early autumn.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dove.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="dove.c1.s2">The lower longer panes of the window were closed, and the glass, divided into circles and quarrels, made the scene less distinct; but still the huge stone tower was traceable, and, farther off, the slope of a gently-rising hill, clothed with vineyards blushing into autumn richness.</s> <s sid="3" id="dove.c1.s3">Below, the view was closed by the gray wall of a court-yard, laden with fruit-trees in full bearing, and inclosing paved paths that radiated from a central fountain, and left spaces between, where a few summer flowers still lingered, and the remains of others showed what their past glory had been.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dove.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="dove.c1.s4">The interior of the room was wainscoted, the floor paved with bright red and cream-coloured tiles, and the tall stove in one corner decorated with the same.</s> <s sid="5" id="dove.c1.s5">The eastern end of the apartment was adorned with an exquisite small group carved in oak, representing the carpenter's shop at Nazareth, with the Holy Child instructed by Joseph in the use of tools, and the Mother sitting with her book, <qs/>"pondering these things in her heart."<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="dove.c1.s6">All around were blocks of wood and carvings in varying states of progress--some scarcely shaped out, and others in perfect completion.</s> <s sid="7" id="dove.c1.s7">And the subjects were equally various.</s> <s sid="8" id="dove.c1.s8">Here was an adoring angel with folded wings, clasped hands, and rapt face; here a majestic head of an apostle or prophet; here a lovely virgin saint, seeming to play smilingly with the instrument of her martyrdom; here a grotesque _miserere_ group, illustrating a fairy tale, or caricaturing a popular fable here a beauteous festoon of flowers and fruit, emulating nature in all save colour; and on the work-table itself, growing under the master's hand, was a long wreath, entirely composed of leaves and seed-vessels in their quaint and beauteous forms--the heart-shaped shepherd's purse, the mask-like skull-cap, and the crowned urn of the henbane.</s> <s sid="9" id="dove.c1.s9">The starred cap of the poppy was actually being shaped under the tool, copied from a green capsule, surmounted with purple velvety rays, which, together with its rough and wavy leaf, was held in the hand of a young maiden who knelt by the table, watching the work with eager interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dove.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="dove.c1.s10">She was not a beautiful girl--not one of those whose <qs/>"bright eyes rain influence, and judge the prize."<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="dove.c1.s11">She was too small, too slight, too retiring for such a position.</s> <s sid="12" id="dove.c1.s12">If there was something lily-like in her drooping grace, it was not the queen-lily of the garden that she resembled, but the retiring lily of the valley--so purely, transparently white was her skin, scarcely tinted by a roseate blush on the cheek, so tender and modest the whole effect of her slender figure, and the soft, downcast, pensive brown eyes, utterly dissimilar in hue from those of all her friends and kindred, except perhaps the bright, quick ones of her uncle, the master-carver.</s> <s sid="13" id="dove.c1.s13">Otherwise, his portly form, open visage, and good-natured stateliness, as well as his furred cap and gold chain, were thoroughly those of the German burgomaster of the fifteenth century; but those glittering black eyes had not ceased to betray their French, or rather Walloon, origin, though for several generations back the family had been settled at Ulm.</s> <s sid="14" id="dove.c1.s14">Perhaps, too, it was Walloon quickness and readiness of wit that had made them, so soon as they became affiliated, so prominent in all the councils of the good free city, and so noted for excellence in art and learning.</s> <s sid="15" id="dove.c1.s15">Indeed the present head of the family, Master Gottfried Sorel, was so much esteemed for his learning that he had once had serious thoughts of terming himself Magister Gothofredus Oxalicus, and might have carried it out but for the very decided objections of his wife, Dame Johanna, and his little niece, Christina, to being dubbed by any such surname.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dove.c1.p5"><s sid="16" id="dove.c1.s16">Master Gottfried had had a scapegrace younger brother named Hugh, who had scorned both books and tools, had been the plague of the workshop, and, instead of coming back from his wandering year of improvement, had joined a band of roving Lanzknechts.</s> <s sid="17" id="dove.c1.s17">No more had been heard of him for a dozen or fifteen years, when he suddenly arrived at the paternal mansion at Ulm, half dead with intermittent fever, and with a young, broken-hearted, and nearly expiring wife, his spoil in his Italian campaigns.</s> <s sid="18" id="dove.c1.s18">His rude affection had utterly failed to console her for her desolated home and slaughtered kindred, and it had so soon turned to brutality that, when brought to comparative peace and rest in his brother's home, there was nothing left for the poor Italian but to lie down and die, commending her babe in broken German to Hausfrau Johanna, and blessing Master Gottfried for his flowing Latin assurances that the child should be to them even as the little maiden who was lying in the God's acre upon the hillside.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dove.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="dove.c1.s19">And verily the little Christina had been a precious gift to the bereaved couple.</s> <s sid="20" id="dove.c1.s20">Her father had no sooner recovered than he returned to his roving life, and, except for a report that he had been seen among the retainers of one of the robber barons of the Swabian Alps, nothing had been heard of him; and Master Gottfried only hoped to be spared the actual pain and scandal of knowing when his eyes were blinded and his head swept off at a blow, or when he was tumbled headlong into a moat, suspended from a tree, or broken on the wheel: a choice of fates that was sure sooner or later to befall him.</s> <s sid="21" id="dove.c1.s21">Meantime, both the burgomeister and burgomeisterinn did their utmost to forget that the gentle little girl was not their own; they set all their hopes and joys on her, and, making her supply the place at once of son and daughter, they bred her up in all the refinements and accomplishments in which the free citizens of Germany took the lead in the middle and latter part of the fifteenth century.</s> <s sid="22" id="dove.c1.s22">To aid her aunt in all house-wifely arts, to prepare dainty food and varied liquors, and to spin, weave, and broider, was only a part of Christina's training; her uncle likewise set great store by her sweet Italian voice, and caused her to be carefully taught to sing and play on the lute, and he likewise delighted in hearing her read aloud to him from the hereditary store of MSS. and from the dark volumes that began to proceed from the press.</s> <s sid="23" id="dove.c1.s23">Nay, Master Gottfried had made experiments in printing and wood-engraving on his own account, and had found no head so intelligent, no hand so desirous to aid him, as his little Christina's, who, in all that needed taste and skill rather than strength, was worth all his prentices and journeymen together.</s> <s sid="24" id="dove.c1.s24">Some fine bold wood-cuts had been produced by their joint efforts; but these less important occupations had of late been set aside by the engrossing interest of the interior fittings of the great <qs/>"Dome Kirk,"<qe/> which for nearly a century had been rising by the united exertions of the burghers, without any assistance from without.</s> <s sid="25" id="dove.c1.s25">The foundation had been laid in 1377; and at length, in the year of grace 1472, the crown of the apse had been closed in, and matters were so forward that Master Gottfried's stall work was already in requisition for the choir.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dove.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="dove.c1.s26"><qs/>"Three cubits more,"<qe/> he reckoned.</s> <s sid="27" id="dove.c1.s27"><qs/>"Child, hast thou found me fruits enough for the completing of this border?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dove.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="dove.c1.s28"><qs/>"O yes, mine uncle.</s> <s sid="29" id="dove.c1.s29">I have the wild rosehip, and the flat shield of the moonwort, and a pea-pod, and more whose names I know not.</s> <s sid="30" id="dove.c1.s30">But should they all be seed and fruit?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dove.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="dove.c1.s31"><qs/>"Yea, truly, my Stina, for this wreath shall speak of the goodly fruits of a completed life."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dove.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="dove.c1.s32"><qs/>"Even as that which you carved in spring told of the blossom and fair promise of youth,"<qe/> returned the maiden.</s> <s sid="33" id="dove.c1.s33"><qs/>"Methinks the one is the most beautiful, as it ought to be;"<qe/><sls/> then, after a little pause, and some reckoning, <sle/><qs/>"I have scarce seed-pods enough in store, uncle; might we not seek some rarer shapes in the herb-garden of Master Gerhard, the physician?</s> <s sid="34" id="dove.c1.s34">He, too, might tell me the names of some of these."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dove.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="dove.c1.s35"><qs/>"True, child; or we might ride into the country beyond the walls, and seek them.</s> <s sid="36" id="dove.c1.s36">What, little one, wouldst thou not?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dove.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="dove.c1.s37"><qs/>"So we go not far,"<qe/> faltered Christina, colouring.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dove.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="dove.c1.s38"><qs/>"Ha, thou hast not forgotten the fright thy companions had from the Schlangenwald reitern when gathering Maydew?</s> <s sid="39" id="dove.c1.s39">Fear not, little coward; if we go beyond the suburbs we will take Hans and Peter with their halberts.</s> <s sid="40" id="dove.c1.s40">But I believe thy silly little heart can scarce be free for enjoyment if it can fancy a Reiter within a dozen leagues of thee."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dove.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="dove.c1.s41"><qs/>"At your side I would not fear.</s> <s sid="42" id="dove.c1.s42">That is, I would not vex thee by my folly, and I might forget it,"<qe/> replied Christina, looking down.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dove.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="dove.c1.s43"><qs/>"My gentle child!"<qe/> the old man said approvingly.</s> <s sid="44" id="dove.c1.s44"><qs/>"Moreover, if our good Raiser has his way, we shall soon be free of the reitern of Schlangenwald, and Adlerstein, and all the rest of the mouse-trap barons.</s> <s sid="45" id="dove.c1.s45">He is hoping to form a league of us free imperial cities with all the more reasonable and honest nobles, to preserve the peace of the country.</s> <s sid="46" id="dove.c1.s46">Even now a letter from him was read in the Town Hall to that effect; and, when all are united against them, my lords-mousers must needs become pledged to the league, or go down before it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dove.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="dove.c1.s47"><qs/>"Ah! that will be well,"<qe/> cried Christina.</s> <s sid="48" id="dove.c1.s48"><qs/>"Then will our wagons be no longer set upon at the Debateable Ford by Schlangenwald or Adlerstein; and our wares will come safely, and there will be wealth enough to raise our spire!</s> <s sid="49" id="dove.c1.s49">O uncle, what a day of joy will that be when Our Lady's great statue will be set on the summit!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dove.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="dove.c1.s50"><qs/>"A day that I shall scarce see, and it will be well if thou dost,"<qe/><sss/> returned her uncle, <sse/><qs/>"unless the hearts of the burghers of Ulm return to the liberality of their fathers, who devised that spire!</s> <s sid="51" id="dove.c1.s51">But what trampling do I hear?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dove.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="dove.c1.s52">There was indeed a sudden confusion in the house, and, before the uncle and niece could rise, the door was opened by a prosperous apple-faced dame, exclaiming in a hasty whisper, <qs/>"Housefather, O Housefather, there are a troop of reitern at the door, dismounting already;"<qe/><sls/> and, as the master came forward, brushing from his furred vest the shavings and dust of his work, she added in a more furtive, startled accent, <sle/><qs/>"and, if I mistake not, one is thy brother!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dove.c8.p2"><s sid="2" id="dove.c8.s2">Yet it was well that the snow came early, for it was the best defence of the lonely castle from any attack on the part of the Schlangenwaldern, the Swabian League, or the next heir, Freiherr Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss.</s> <s sid="3" id="dove.c8.s3">The elder Baroness had, at least, the merit of a stout heart, and, even with her sadly-reduced garrison, feared none of them.</s> <s sid="4" id="dove.c8.s4">She had been brought up in the faith that Adlerstein was impregnable, and so she still believed; and, if the disaster that had cut off her husband and son was to happen at all, she was glad that it had befallen before the homage had been paid.</s> <s sid="5" id="dove.c8.s5">Probably the Schlangenwald Count knew how tough a morsel the castle was like to prove, and Wildschloss was serving at a distance, for nothing was heard of either during the short interval while the roads were still open.</s> <s sid="6" id="dove.c8.s6">During this time an attempt had been made through Father Norbert to ascertain what had become of the corpses of the two Barons and their followers, and it had appeared that the Count had carried them all off from the inn, no doubt to adorn his castle with their limbs, or to present them to the Emperor in evidence of his zeal for order.</s> <s sid="7" id="dove.c8.s7">The old Baron could not indeed have been buried in consecrated ground, nor have masses said for him; but for the weal of her son's soul Dame Kunigunde gave some of her few ornaments, and Christina added her gold earrings, and all her scanty purse, that both her husband and father might be joined in the prayers of the Church--trying with all her might to put confidence in Hugh Sorel's Loretto relic, and the Indulgence he had bought, and trusting with more consolatory thoughts to the ever stronger dawnings of good she had watched in her own Eberhard.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dove.c8.p3"><s sid="8" id="dove.c8.s8">She had some consoling intercourse with the priest while all this was pending; but throughout the winter she was entirely cut off from every creature save the inmates of the castle, where, as far as the old lady was concerned, she only existed on sufferance, and all her meekness and gentleness could not win for her more than the barest toleration.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dove.c8.p4"><s sid="9" id="dove.c8.s9">That Eberhard had for a few hours survived his father, and that thus the Freiherrinn Christina was as much the Dowager Baroness as Kunigunde herself, was often insisted on in the kitchen by Ursel, Hatto, and the Schneiderlein, whom Christina had unconsciously rendered her most devoted servant, not only by her daily care of his wound, but by her kind courteous words, and by her giving him his proper name of Heinz, dropping the absurd _nom de guerre_ of the Schneiderlein, or little tailor, which had been originally conferred on him in allusion to the valiant Tailorling who boasted of having killed seven flies at a blow, and had been carried on chiefly because of the contradiction between such a title and his huge brawny strength and fierce courage.</s> <s sid="10" id="dove.c8.s10">Poor Eberhard, with his undaunted bravery and free reckless good-nature, a ruffian far more by education than by nature, had been much loved by his followers.</s> <s sid="11" id="dove.c8.s11">His widow would have reaped the benefit of that affection even if her exceeding sweetness had not gained it on her own account; and this giant was completely gained over to her, when, amid all her sorrow and feebleness, she never failed to minister to his sufferings to the utmost, while her questions about his original home, and revival of the name of his childhood, softened him, and awoke in him better feelings.</s> <s sid="12" id="dove.c8.s12">He would have died to serve her, and she might have headed an opposition party in the castle, had she not been quite indifferent to all save her grief; and, except by sitting above the salt at the empty table, she laid no claim to any honours or authority, and was more seldom than ever seen beyond what was now called her own room.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dove.c8.p5"><s sid="13" id="dove.c8.s13">At last, when for the second time she was seeing the snow wreaths dwindle, and the drops shine forth in moisture again, while the mountain paths were set free by the might of the springtide sun, she spoke almost for the first time with authority, as she desired Heinz to saddle her mule, and escort her to join in the Easter mass at the Blessed Friedmund's Chapel.</s> <s sid="14" id="dove.c8.s14">Ursel heaped up objections; but so urgent was Christina for confession and for mass, that the old woman had not the heart to stop her by a warning to the elder Baroness, and took the alternative of accompanying her.</s> <s sid="15" id="dove.c8.s15">It was a glorious sparkling Easter Day, lovely blue sky above, herbage and flowers glistening below, snow dazzling in the hollows, peasants assembling in holiday garb, and all rejoicing.</s> <s sid="16" id="dove.c8.s16">Even the lonely widow, in her heavy veil and black mufflings, took hope back to her heart, and smiled when at the church door a little child came timidly up to her with a madder-tinted Easter egg--a gift once again like the happy home customs of Ulm.</s> <s sid="17" id="dove.c8.s17">She gave the child a kiss--she had nothing else to give, but the sweet face sent it away strangely glad.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dove.c8.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="dove.c8.s18">The festival mass in all its exultation was not fully over, when anxious faces began to be seen at the door, and whisperings went round and many passed out.</s> <s sid="19" id="dove.c8.s19">Nobody at Adlerstein was particular about silence in church, and, when the service was not in progress, voices were not even lowered, and, after many attempts on the part of the Schneiderlein to attract the attention of his mistress, his voice immediately succeeded the _Ite missa est_, <qs/>"Gracious lady, we must begone.</s> <s sid="20" id="dove.c8.s20">Your mule is ready.</s> <s sid="21" id="dove.c8.s21">There is a party at the Debateable Ford, whether Schlangenwald or Wildschloss we know not yet, but either way you must be the first thing placed in safety."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dove.c8.p7"><s sid="22" id="dove.c8.s22">Christina turned deadly pale.</s> <s sid="23" id="dove.c8.s23">She had long been ready to welcome death as a peaceful friend; but, sheltered as her girlhood had been in the quiet city, she had never been brought in contact with warfare, and her nervous, timid temperament made the thought most appalling and frightful to her, certain as she was that the old Baroness would resist to the uttermost.</s> <s sid="24" id="dove.c8.s24">Father Norbert saw her extreme terror, and, with the thought that he might comfort and support her, perhaps mediate between the contending parties, plead that it was holy-tide, and proclaim the peace of the church, or at the worst protect the lady herself, he offered his company; but, though she thanked him, it was as if she scarcely understood his kindness, and a shudder passed over her whenever the serfs, hastily summoned to augment the garrison, came hurrying down the path, or turned aside into the more rugged and shorter descents.</s> <s sid="25" id="dove.c8.s25">It was strange, the good father thought, that so timorous and fragile a being should have her lot cast amid these rugged places and scenes of violence, with no one to give her the care and cherishing she so much required.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dove.c8.p8"><s sid="26" id="dove.c8.s26">Even when she crept up the castle stairs, she was met with an angry rebuke, not so much for the peril she had incurred as for having taken away the Schneiderlein, by far the most availing among the scanty remnant of the retainers of Adlerstein.</s> <s sid="27" id="dove.c8.s27">Attempting no answer, and not even daring to ask from what quarter came the alarm, Christina made her way out of the turmoil to that chamber of her own, the scene of so much fear and sorrow, and yet of some share of peace and happiness.</s> <s sid="28" id="dove.c8.s28">But from the window, near the fast subsiding waters of the Debateable Ford, could plainly be seen the small troop of warriors, of whom Jobst the Kohler had brought immediate intelligence.</s> <s sid="29" id="dove.c8.s29">The sun glistened on their armour, and a banner floated gaily on the wind; but they were a fearful sight to the inmates of the lonely castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dove.c8.p9"><s sid="30" id="dove.c8.s30">A stout heart was however Kunigunde's best endowment; and, with the steadiness and precision of a general, her commands rang out, as she arranged and armed her garrison, perfectly resolved against any submission, and confident in the strength of her castle; nay, not without a hope of revenge either against Schlangenwald or Wildschloss, whom, as a degenerate Adlerstein, she hated only less than the slayer of her husband and son.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dove.c8.p10"><s sid="31" id="dove.c8.s31">The afternoon of Easter Day however passed away without any movement on the part of the enemy, and it was not till the following day that they could be seen struggling through the ford, and preparing to ascend the mountain.</s> <s sid="32" id="dove.c8.s32">Attacks had sometimes been disconcerted by posting men in the most dangerous passes; but, in the lack of numbers, and of trustworthy commanders, the Freiherrinn had judged it wiser to trust entirely to her walls, and keep her whole force within them.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dove.c8.p11"><s sid="33" id="dove.c8.s33">The new comers could hardly have had any hostile intentions, for, though well armed and accoutred, their numbers did not exceed twenty-five.</s> <s sid="34" id="dove.c8.s34">The banner borne at their head was an azure one, with a white eagle, and their leader could be observed looking with amazement at the top of the watch-tower, where the same eagle had that morning been hoisted for the first time since the fall of the two Freiherren.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dove.c8.p12"><s sid="35" id="dove.c8.s35">So soon as the ascent had been made, the leader wound his horn, and, before the echoes had died away among the hills, Hatto, acting as seneschal, was demanding his purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dove.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="dove.c8.s36"><qs/>"I am Kasimir von Adlerstein Wildschloss,"<qe/> was the reply.</s> <s sid="37" id="dove.c8.s37"><qs/>"I have hitherto been hindered by stress of weather from coming to take possession of my inheritance.</s> <s sid="38" id="dove.c8.s38">Admit me, that I may arrange with the widowed Frau Freiherrinn as to her dower and residence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dove.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="dove.c8.s39"><qs/>"The widowed Frau Freiherrinn, born of Adlerstein,"<qe/><sss/> returned Hatto, <sse/><qs/>"thanks the Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss; but she holds the castle as guardian to the present head of the family, the Freiherr von Adlerstein."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dove.c8.p15" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="dove.c8.s40"><qs/>"It is false, old man,"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed the Wildschloss; <sse/><qs/>"the Freiherr had no other son."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dove.c8.p16" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="dove.c8.s41"><qs/>"No,"<qe/><sss/> said Hatto, <sse/><qs/>"but Freiherr Eberhard hath left us twin heirs, our young lords, for whom we hold this castle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dove.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="dove.c8.s42"><qs/>"This trifling will not serve!"<qe/> sternly spoke the knight.</s> <s sid="43" id="dove.c8.s43"><qs/>"Eberhard von Adlerstein died unmarried."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dove.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="dove.c8.s44"><qs/>"Not so,"<qe/><sss/> returned Hatto, <sse/><qs/>"our gracious Frau Freiherrinn, the younger, was wedded to him at the last Friedmund Wake, by the special blessing of our good patron, who would not see our house extinct."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dove.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="dove.c8.s45"><qs/>"I must see thy lady, old man,"<qe/> said Sir Kasimir, impatiently, not in the least crediting the story, and believing his cousin Kunigunde quite capable of any measure that could preserve to her the rule in Schloss Adlerstein, even to erecting some passing love affair of her son's into a marriage.</s> <s sid="46" id="dove.c8.s46">And he hardly did her injustice, for she had never made any inquiry beyond the castle into the validity of Christina's espousals, nor sought after the friar who had performed the ceremony.</s> <s sid="47" id="dove.c8.s47">She consented to an interview with the claimant of the inheritance, and descended to the gateway for the purpose.</s> <s sid="48" id="dove.c8.s48">The court was at its cleanest, the thawing snow having newly washed away its impurities, and her proud figure, under her black hood and veil, made an imposing appearance as she stood tall and defiant in the archway.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dove.c8.p20"><s sid="49" id="dove.c8.s49">Sir Kasimir was a handsome man of about thirty, of partly Polish descent, and endowed with Slavonic grace and courtesy, and he had likewise been employed in negotiations with Burgundy, and had acquired much polish and knowledge of the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dove.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="dove.c8.s50"><qs/>"Lady,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"I regret to disturb and intrude on a mourning family, but I am much amazed at the tidings I have heard; and I must pray of you to confirm them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="dove.c8.p22" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="dove.c8.s51"><qs/>"I thought they would confound you,"<qe/> composedly replied Kunigunde.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="dove.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="dove.c8.s52"><qs/>"And pardon me, lady, but the Diet is very nice in requiring full proofs.</s> <s sid="53" id="dove.c8.s53">I would be glad to learn what lady was chosen by my deceased cousin Eberhard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dove.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="dove.c8.s54"><qs/>"The lady is Christina, daughter of his esquire, Hugh Sorel, of an honourable family at Ulm."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dove.c8.p25" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="dove.c8.s55"><qs/>"Ha!</s> <s sid="56" id="dove.c8.s56">I know who and what Sorel was!"<qe/> exclaimed Wildschloss.</s> <s sid="57" id="dove.c8.s57"><qs/>"Lady cousin, thou wouldst not stain the shield of Adlerstein with owning aught that cannot bear the examination of the Diet!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dove.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="dove.c8.s58"><qs/>"Sir Kasimir,"<qe/><sss/> said Kunigunde proudly, <sse/><qs/>"had I known the truth ere my son's death, I had strangled the girl with mine own hands!</s> <s sid="59" id="dove.c8.s59">But I learnt it only by his dying confession; and, had she been a beggar's child, she was his wedded wife, and her babes are his lawful heirs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="dove.c8.p27" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="dove.c8.s60"><qs/>"Knowest thou time--place--witnesses?"<qe/> inquired Sir Kasimir.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="dove.c8.p28" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="dove.c8.s61"><qs/>"The time, the Friedmund Wake; the place, the Friedmund Chapel,"<qe/> replied the Baroness.</s> <s sid="62" id="dove.c8.s62"><qs/>"Come hither, Schneiderlein.</s> <s sid="63" id="dove.c8.s63">Tell the knight thy young lord's confession."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="dove.c8.p29"><s sid="64" id="dove.c8.s64">He bore emphatic testimony to poor Eberhard's last words; but as to the point of who had performed the ceremony, he knew not,--his mind had not retained the name.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="dove.c8.p30" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="dove.c8.s65"><qs/>"I must see the Frau herself,"<qe/> said Wildschloss, feeling certain that such a being as he expected in a daughter of the dissolute lanzknecht Sorel would soon, by dexterous questioning, be made to expose the futility of her pretensions so flagrantly that even Kunigunde could not attempt to maintain them.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dove.c8.p31"><s sid="66" id="dove.c8.s66">For one moment Kunigunde hesitated, but suddenly a look of malignant satisfaction crossed her face.</s> <s sid="67" id="dove.c8.s67">She spoke a few words to Squinting Matz, and then replied that Sir Kasimir should be allowed to satisfy himself, but that she could admit no one else into the castle; hers was a widow's household, the twins were only a few hours old, and she could not open her gates to admit any person besides himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dove.c8.p32"><s sid="68" id="dove.c8.s68">So resolved on judging for himself was Adlerstein Wildschloss that all this did not stagger him; for, even if he had believed more than he did of the old lady's story, there would have been no sense of intrusion or impropriety in such a visit to the mother.</s> <s sid="69" id="dove.c8.s69">Indeed, had Christina been living in the civilized world, her chamber would have been hung with black cloth, black velvet would have enveloped her up to the eyes, and the blackest of cradles would have stood ready for her fatherless babe; two steps, in honour of her baronial rank, would have led to her bed, and a beaufet with the due baronial amount of gold and silver plate would have held the comfits and caudle to be dispensed to all visitors.</s> <s sid="70" id="dove.c8.s70">As it was, the two steps built into the floor of the room, and the black hood that Ursel tied over her young mistress's head, were the only traces that such etiquette had ever been heard of.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dove.c8.p33"><s sid="71" id="dove.c8.s71">But when Baron Kasimir had clanked up the turret stairs, each step bringing to her many a memory of him who should have been there, and when he had been led to the bedside, he was completely taken by surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dove.c8.p34"><s sid="72" id="dove.c8.s72">Instead of the great, flat-faced, coarse comeliness of a German wench, treated as a lady in order to deceive him, he saw a delicate, lily-like face, white as ivory, and the soft, sweet brown eyes under their drooping lashes, so full of innocence and sad though thankful content, that he felt as if the inquiries he came to make were almost sacrilege.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="dove.c8.p35"><s sid="73" id="dove.c8.s73">He had seen enough of the world to know that no agent in a clumsy imposition would look like this pure white creature, with her arm encircling the two little swaddled babes, whose red faces and bald heads alone were allowed to appear above their mummy-like wrappings; and he could only make an obeisance lower and infinitely more respectful than that with which he had favoured the Baroness _nee_ von Adlerstein, with a few words of inquiry and apology.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="dove.c8.p36" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="dove.c8.s74">But Christina had her sons' rights to defend now, and she had far more spirit to do so than ever she had had in securing her own position, and a delicate rose tint came into her cheek as she said in her soft voice, <qs/>"The Baroness tells me, that you, noble sir, would learn who wedded me to my dear and blessed lord, Sir Eberhard.</s> <s sid="75" id="dove.c8.s75">It was Friar Peter of the Franciscan brotherhood of Offingen, an agent for selling indulgences.</s> <s sid="76" id="dove.c8.s76">Two of his lay brethren were present.</s> <s sid="77" id="dove.c8.s77">My dear lord gave his own name and mine in full after the holy rite; the friar promising his testimony if it were needed.</s> <s sid="78" id="dove.c8.s78">He is to be found, or at least heard of, at his own cloister; and the hermit at the chapel likewise beheld a part of the ceremony."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="dove.c8.p37" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="dove.c8.s79"><qs/>"Enough, enough, lady,"<qe/><sss/> replied Sir Kasimir; <sse/><qs/>"forgive me for having forced the question upon you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="dove.c8.p38" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="dove.c8.s80"><qs/>"Nay,"<qe/><sls/> replied Christina, with her blush deepening, <sle/><qs/>"it is but just and due to us all;"<qe/><sls/> and her soft eyes had a gleam of exultation, as she looked at the two little mummies that made up the _us_--<sle/><qs/>"I would have all inquiries made in full."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="dove.c8.p39" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="dove.c8.s81"><qs/>"They shall be made, lady, as will be needful for the establishment of your son's right as a free Baron of the empire, but not with any doubt on my part, or desire to controvert that right.</s> <s sid="82" id="dove.c8.s82">I am fully convinced, and only wish to serve you and my little cousins.</s> <s sid="83" id="dove.c8.s83">Which of them is the head of our family?"<qe/> he added, looking at the two absolutely undistinguishable little chrysalises, so exactly alike that Christina herself was obliged to look for the black ribbon, on which a medal had been hung, round the neck of the elder.</s> <s sid="84" id="dove.c8.s84">Sir Kasimir put one knee to the ground as he kissed the red cheek of the infant and the white hand of the mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="dove.c8.p40" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="dove.c8.s85"><qs/>"Lady cousin,"<qe/><sls/> he said to Kunigunde, who had stood by all this time with an anxious, uneasy, scowling expression on her face, <sle/><qs/>"I am satisfied.</s> <s sid="86" id="dove.c8.s86">I own this babe as the true Freiherr von Adlerstein, and far be it from me to trouble his heritage.</s> <s sid="87" id="dove.c8.s87">Rather point out the way in which I may serve you and him.</s> <s sid="88" id="dove.c8.s88">Shall I represent all to the Emperor, and obtain his wardship, so as to be able to protect you from any attacks by the enemies of the house?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="dove.c8.p41" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="dove.c8.s89"><qs/>"Thanks, sir,"<qe/> returned the elder lady, severely, seeing Christina's gratified, imploring face.</s> <s sid="90" id="dove.c8.s90"><qs/>"The right line of Adlerstein can take care of itself without greedy guardians appointed by usurpers.</s> <s sid="91" id="dove.c8.s91">Our submission has never been made, and the Emperor cannot dispose of our wardship."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="dove.c8.p42" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="dove.c8.s92">And Kunigunde looked defiant, regarding herself and her grandson as quite as good as the Emperor, and ready to blast her daughter-in-law with her eyes for murmuring gratefully and wistfully, <qs/>"Thanks, noble sir, thanks!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="dove.c8.p43" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="dove.c8.s93"><qs/>"Let me at least win a friendly right in my young cousins,"<qe/> said Sir Kasimir, the more drawn by pitying admiration towards their mother, as he perceived more of the grandmother's haughty repulsiveness and want of comprehension of the dangers of her position.</s> <s sid="94" id="dove.c8.s94"><qs/>"They are not baptized?</s> <s sid="95" id="dove.c8.s95">Let me become their godfather."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="dove.c8.p44"><s sid="96" id="dove.c8.s96">Christina's face was all joy and gratitude, and even the grandmother made no objection; in fact, it was the babes' only chance of a noble sponsor; and Father Norbert, who had already been making ready for the baptism, was sent for from the hall.</s> <s sid="97" id="dove.c8.s97">Kunigunde, meantime, moved about restlessly, went half-way down the stairs, and held council with some one there; Ursel likewise, bustled about, and Sir Kasimir remained seated on the chair that had been placed for him near Christina's bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="dove.c8.p45" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="dove.c8.s98">She was able again to thank him, and add, <qs/>"It may be that you will have more cause than the lady grandmother thinks to remember your offer of protection to my poor orphans.</s> <s sid="99" id="dove.c8.s99">Their father and grandfather were, in very deed, on their way to make submission."<qe/></s> </p>
