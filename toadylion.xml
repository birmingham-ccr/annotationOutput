<title>CHAPTER I. PRISSY, HUGH JOHN, AND SIR TOADY LION.</title>
<p pid="1" id="toadylion.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="toadylion.c1.s1">It is always difficult to be great, but it is specially difficult when greatness is thrust upon one, as it were, along with the additional burden of a distinguished historical name.</s> <s sid="2" id="toadylion.c1.s2">This was the case with General Napoleon Smith.</s> <s sid="3" id="toadylion.c1.s3">Yet when this story opens he was not a general.</s> <s sid="4" id="toadylion.c1.s4">That came later, along with the cares of empire and the management of great campaigns.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="toadylion.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="toadylion.c1.s5">But already in secret he was Napoleon Smith, though his nurse sometimes still referred to him as Johnnie, and his father--but stay.</s> <s sid="6" id="toadylion.c1.s6">I will reveal to you the secret of our soldier's life right at the start.</s> <s sid="7" id="toadylion.c1.s7">Though a Napoleon, our hero was no Buonaparte.</s> <s sid="8" id="toadylion.c1.s8">No, his name was Smith--plain Smith; his father was the owner of four large farms and a good many smaller ones, near that celebrated Border which separates the two hostile countries of England and Scotland.</s> <s sid="9" id="toadylion.c1.s9">Neighbours referred to the General's father easily as <qs/>"Picton Smith of Windy Standard,"<qe/> from the soughing, mist-nursing mountain of heather and fir-trees which gave its name to the estate, and to the large farm he had cultivated himself ever since the death of his wife, chiefly as a means of distracting his mind, and keeping at a distance loneliness and sad thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="toadylion.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="toadylion.c1.s10">Hugh John Smith had never mentioned the fact of his Imperial descent to his father, but in a moment of confidence he had told his old nurse, who smiled with a world-weary wisdom, which betrayed her knowledge of the secrets of courts--and said that doubtless it was so.</s> <s sid="11" id="toadylion.c1.s11">He had also a brother and sister, but they were not, at that time, of the race of the Corporal of Ajaccio.</s> <s sid="12" id="toadylion.c1.s12">On the contrary, Arthur George, the younger, aged five, was an engine-driver.</s> <s sid="13" id="toadylion.c1.s13">There was yet another who rode in a mail-cart, and puckered up his face upon being addressed in a strange foreign language, as <qs/>"Was-it-then?</s> <s sid="14" id="toadylion.c1.s14">A darling--goo-goo--then it was!"<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="toadylion.c1.s15">This creature, however, was not owned as a brother by Hugh John and Arthur George, and indeed may at this point be dismissed from the story.</s> <s sid="16" id="toadylion.c1.s16">The former went so far as stoutly to deny his brother's sex, in the face of such proofs as were daily afforded by Baby's tendency to slap his sister's face wherever they met, and also to seize things and throw them on the floor for the pleasure of seeing them break.</s> <s sid="17" id="toadylion.c1.s17">Arthur George, however, had secret hopes that Baby would even yet turn out a satisfactory boy whenever he saw him killing flies on the window, and on these occasions hounded him on to yet deadlier exertions.</s> <s sid="18" id="toadylion.c1.s18">But he dared not mention his anticipations to his soldier brother, that haughty scion of an Imperial race.</s> <s sid="19" id="toadylion.c1.s19">For reasons afterwards to be given, Arthur George was usually known as Toady Lion.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="toadylion.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="toadylion.c1.s20">Then Hugh John had a sister.</s> <s sid="21" id="toadylion.c1.s21">Her name was Priscilla.</s> <s sid="22" id="toadylion.c1.s22">Priscilla was distinguished also, though not in a military sense.</s> <s sid="23" id="toadylion.c1.s23">She was literary, and wrote books <qs/>"on the sly,"<qe/> as Hugh John said.</s> <s sid="24" id="toadylion.c1.s24">He considered this secrecy the only respectable part of a very shady business.</s> <s sid="25" id="toadylion.c1.s25">Specially he objected to being made to serve as the hero of Priscilla's tales, and went so far as to promise to "thump" his sister if he caught her introducing him as of any military rank under that of either general or colour-sergeant.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="toadylion.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="toadylion.c1.s26"><qs/>"Look here, Pris,"<qe/><sls/> he said on one occasion, <sle/><qs/>"if you put me into your beastly girl books all about dolls and love and trumpery, I'll bat you over the head with a wicket!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="toadylion.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="toadylion.c1.s27"><qs/>"Hum--I dare say, if you could catch me,"<qe/> said Priscilla, with her nose very much in the air.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="toadylion.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="toadylion.c1.s35"><qs/>"By Jove, then, I just will!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="toadylion.c1.p10"><s sid="36" id="toadylion.c1.s36">It is sad to be obliged to state here, in the very beginning of these veracious chronicles, that at this time Prissy and Napoleon Smith were by no means model children, though Prissy afterwards marvellously improved.</s> <s sid="37" id="toadylion.c1.s37">Even their best friends admitted as much, and as for their enemies--well, their old gardener's remarks when they chased each other over his newly planted beds would be out of place even in a military periodical, and might be the means of preventing a book with Mr. Gordon Browne's nice pictures from being included in some well-conducted Sunday-school libraries.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="toadylion.c1.p11"><s sid="38" id="toadylion.c1.s38">General Napoleon Smith could not catch Priscilla (as, indeed, he well knew before he started), especially when she picked up her skirts and went right at hedges and ditches like a young colt.</s> <s sid="39" id="toadylion.c1.s39">Napoleon looked upon this trait in Prissy's character as degrading and unsportsmanlike in the extreme.</s> <s sid="40" id="toadylion.c1.s40">He regarded long skirts, streaming hair, and flapping, aggravating pinafores as the natural handicap of girls in the race of life, and as particularly useful when they "cheeked" their brothers.</s> <s sid="41" id="toadylion.c1.s41">It was therefore wicked to neutralise these equalising disadvantages by strings tied round above the knees, or by the still more scientific device of a sash suspended from the belt before, passed between Prissy's legs, and attached to the belt behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="toadylion.c1.p12"><s sid="42" id="toadylion.c1.s42">But, then, as Napoleon admitted even at ten years of age, girls are capable of anything; and to his dying day he has never had any reason to change his opinion--at least, so far as he has yet got.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="toadylion.c1.p15"><s sid="45" id="toadylion.c1.s45">It was thus that Priscilla, to whom in after times great lights of criticism listened with approval, was compelled to stoop to artifice and bribery in order to secure and hold her first audience.</s> <s sid="46" id="toadylion.c1.s46">Whereupon the authoress took paper from her pocket, and as she did so, held the manuscript with its back to Napoleon Smith, in order to conceal the suspicious shortness of the lines.</s> <s sid="47" id="toadylion.c1.s47">But that great soldier instantly detected the subterfuge.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="toadylion.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="toadylion.c1.s48"><qs/>"It's a penny more for listening to poetry!"<qe/> he said, with sudden alacrity.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="toadylion.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="toadylion.c1.s49"><qs/>"I know it is,"<qe/><sss/> replied Prissy sadly, <sse/><qs/>"but you might be nice about it just this once.</s> <s sid="50" id="toadylion.c1.s50">I'm dreadfully, dreadfully poor this week, Hugh John!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="toadylion.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="toadylion.c1.s51"><qs/>"So am I,"<qe/><sss/> retorted Napoleon Smith sternly; <sse/><qs/>"if I wasn't, do you think I would listen at all to your beastly old poetry?</s> <s sid="52" id="toadylion.c1.s52">Drive on!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="toadylion.c1.p19"><s sid="53" id="toadylion.c1.s53">Thus encouraged, Priscilla meekly began--</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="toadylion.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="toadylion.c1.s55"><qs/>"That's not quite so bad as usual,"<qe/> said Napoleon condescendingly, toying meanwhile with the lash of an old dog-whip he had just "boned" out of the harness-room.</s> <s sid="56" id="toadylion.c1.s56">Priscilla beamed gratefully upon her critic, and proceeded--</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="toadylion.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="toadylion.c1.s57"><qs/>"_He rides him forth across the sand_----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="toadylion.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="toadylion.c1.s60"><qs/>"It means himself,"<qe/> said Priscilla meekly.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="toadylion.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="toadylion.c1.s61"><qs/>"Then why doesn't _it_ say so?"<qe/> cried the critic triumphantly, tapping his boot with the "boned" dog-whip just like any ordinary lord of creation in presence of his inferiors.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="toadylion.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="toadylion.c1.s62"><qs/>"It's poetry,"<qe/> explained Priscilla timidly.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="toadylion.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="toadylion.c1.s63"><qs/>"It's silly!"<qe/> retorted Napoleon, judicially and finally.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="toadylion.c4.p2"><s sid="6" id="toadylion.c4.s6">And so it was still.</s> <s sid="7" id="toadylion.c4.s7">Mr. Picton Smith had, indeed, only bought the property a few years before the birth of our hero; but, among other encumbrances, he had taken over a lawsuit with the town concerning the castle, which for years had been dragging its slow length along.</s> <s sid="8" id="toadylion.c4.s8">Edam Abbey was a show-place of world-wide repute, and the shillings of the tourist constituted a very important item in the finances of the overburdened municipality.</s> <s sid="9" id="toadylion.c4.s9">If the Council and magistrates of the good town of Edam could add the Castle of Windy Standard to their attractions, the resultant additional sixpence a head would go far towards making up the ancient rental of the town parks, which now let for exactly half of their former value.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="toadylion.c4.p3"><s sid="10" id="toadylion.c4.s10">But Mr. Picton Smith was not minded thus tamely to hand over an ancient fortress, secured to him by deed and charter.</s> <s sid="11" id="toadylion.c4.s11">He declared at once that he would resist the claims of the town by every means in his power.</s> <s sid="12" id="toadylion.c4.s12">He would, however, refuse right-of-way to no respectable sightseer.</s> <s sid="13" id="toadylion.c4.s13">The painter, all unchallenged, might set up his easel there, the poet meditate, even the casual wanderer in search of the picturesque and romantic, have free access to these gloomy and desolate halls.</s> <s sid="14" id="toadylion.c4.s14">The townspeople would be at liberty to conduct their friends and visitors thither.</s> <s sid="15" id="toadylion.c4.s15">But Mr. Smith was resolved that the ancient fortalice of the Windy Standard should not be made a vulgar show.</s> <s sid="16" id="toadylion.c4.s16">Sandwich papers and ginger-beer bottles would not be permitted to profane the green sward of the courtyard, across which had so often ridden all the chivalry of the dead Lorraines.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="toadylion.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="toadylion.c4.s17"><qs/>"Those who want sixpenny shows will find plenty at Edam Fair,"<qe/> was Mr. Picton Smith's ultimatum.</s> <s sid="18" id="toadylion.c4.s18">And when he had once committed himself, like most of his stalwart name, Mr. Smith had the reputation of being very set in his mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="toadylion.c4.p5"><s sid="19" id="toadylion.c4.s19">But in spite of this the town asserted its right-of-way through the courtyard.</s> <s sid="20" id="toadylion.c4.s20">A footpath was said to have passed that way by which persons might go to and fro to kirk and market.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="toadylion.c4.p6" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="toadylion.c4.s21"><qs/>"I have no doubt a footpath passed through my dining-room a few centuries ago,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Smith, <sse/><qs/>"but that does not compel me to keep my front and back doors open for all the rabble of Edam to come and go at their pleasure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="toadylion.c4.p7"><s sid="22" id="toadylion.c4.s22">And forthwith he locked his lodge gates and bought the largest mastiff he could obtain.</s> <s sid="23" id="toadylion.c4.s23">The castle stood on an island rather more than a mile long, a little below the mansion house.</s> <s sid="24" id="toadylion.c4.s24">A wooden bridge led over the deeper, narrower, and more rapid branch of the Edam River from the direction of the abbey and town.</s> <s sid="25" id="toadylion.c4.s25">Across the broader and shallower branch there could be traced, from the house of Windy Standard, the remains of an ancient causeway.</s> <s sid="26" id="toadylion.c4.s26">This, in the place where the stream was to be crossed, had become a series of stepping-stones over which Hugh John and Priscilla could go at a run (without falling in and wetting themselves more than once in three or four times), but which still constituted an impregnable barrier to the short fat legs of Toady Lion--who usually stood on the shore and proclaimed his woes to the world at large till somebody carried him over and deposited him on the castle island.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="toadylion.c4.p8"><s sid="27" id="toadylion.c4.s27">Affairs were in this unsettled condition when, at twelve years of age, Hugh John ceased to be Hugh John, and became, without, however, losing his usual surname of Smith, one of the august and imperial race of the Buonapartes.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="toadylion.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="toadylion.c4.s28">It was a clear June evening, the kind of night when the whole landscape seems to have been newly swept, washed down, and generally spring-cleaned.</s> <s sid="29" id="toadylion.c4.s29">All nature spoke peace to Janet Sheepshanks, housekeeper, nurse, and general responsible female head of the house of Windy Standard, when a procession came towards her across the stepping-stones over the broad Edam water from the direction of the castle island.</s> <s sid="30" id="toadylion.c4.s30">Never had such a disreputable sight presented itself to the eyes of Janet Sheepshanks.</s> <s sid="31" id="toadylion.c4.s31">At once douce and severe, sharp-tongued and covertly affectionate, she represented the authority of a father who was frequently absent from them, and the memory of a dead mother which remained to the three children in widely different degrees.</s> <s sid="32" id="toadylion.c4.s32">To Priscilla her mother was a loving being, gracious alike by the tender sympathy of her voice and by the magic of a touch which healed all childish troubles with the kiss of peace upon the place <qs/>"to make it well."<qe/></s> <s sid="33" id="toadylion.c4.s33">To Hugh John she had been a confidant to whom he could rush, eager and dishevelled, with the tale of the glorious defeat of some tin enemy (for even in those prehistoric days Hugh John had been a soldier), and who, smoothing back his ruffled hair, was prepared to join as eagerly as himself in all his tiny triumphs.</s> <s sid="34" id="toadylion.c4.s34">But to Toady Lion, though he hushed the shrill persistence of his treble to a reverent murmur when he talked of <qs/>"muvver,"<qe/> she was only an imagination, fostered mostly by Priscilla--his notion of motherhood being taken from his rough-handed loving Janet Sheepshanks; while the tomb in the village churchyard was a place to which he had no desire to accompany his mother, and from whose gloomy precincts he sought to escape as soon as possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="toadylion.c5.p8"><s sid="23" id="toadylion.c5.s23">It was upon Priscilla, as the eldest in years and senior responsible officer in charge, that Janet first turned the vials of her wrath.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IX. PUT TO THE QUESTION.</title>
<p pid="1" id="toadylion.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="toadylion.c9.s1">In the chaste retirement of his sick room the Field-Marshal had just reached this conclusion, when he heard a noise in the hall.</s> <s sid="2" id="toadylion.c9.s2">There was a sound of the gruff unmirthful voices of grown-ups, a scuffling of feet, a planting of whips and walking-sticks on the zinc-bottomed hall-stand, and then, after a pause which meant drinks, heavy footsteps in the passage which led to the hero's chamber.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="toadylion.c9.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="toadylion.c9.s3">Hugh John snatched up Sambo Soulis and thrust him deep beneath the bedclothes, where he could readily push him over the end with his toes, if it should chance to be "the doctor-beast" come to uncover him and <qs/>"fool with the bandages."<qe/></s> <s sid="4" id="toadylion.c9.s4">I have said enough to show that the General was not only frankly savage in sentiment, but resembled his great imperial namesake in being grateful only when it suited him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="toadylion.c9.p3"><s sid="5" id="toadylion.c9.s5">Before General Napoleon had his toes fairly settled over the back of Sambo Soulis' neck, so as to be able to remove him out of harm's way on any sudden alarm, the door opened and his father came in, ushering two men, the first of whom came forward to the bedside in an easy, kindly manner, and held out his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="toadylion.c9.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="toadylion.c9.s6"><qs/>"Do you know me?"<qe/> he said, giving Hugh John's second sorest hand such a squeeze that the wounded hero was glad it was not the very sorest one.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="toadylion.c9.p5" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="toadylion.c9.s7"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> replied the hero promptly, <sse/><qs/>"you are Sammy Carter's father.</s> <s sid="8" id="toadylion.c9.s8">I can jolly well lick----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="toadylion.c9.p6" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="toadylion.c9.s9"><qs/>"Hugh John,"<qe/><sss/> interrupted his father severely, <sse/><qs/>"remember what you are saying to Mr. Davenant Carter."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="toadylion.c9.p7" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="toadylion.c9.s10"><qs/>"Well, anyway, I _can_ lick Sammy Carter till he's dumb-sick!"<qe/> muttered the General between his teeth, as he avoided the three pairs of eyes that were turned upon him.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="toadylion.c9.p8" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="toadylion.c9.s11"><qs/>"Oh, let him say just what he likes!"<qe/> said Mr. Davenant Carter jovially.</s> <s sid="12" id="toadylion.c9.s12"><qs/>"Sammy is the better of being licked, if that is what the boy was going to say.</s> <s sid="13" id="toadylion.c9.s13">I sometimes try my hand at it myself with some success."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="toadylion.c9.p9"><s sid="14" id="toadylion.c9.s14">The other man who had come in with Mr. Smith was a thick-set fellow of middle height, with a curious air of being dressed up in somebody else's clothes.</s> <s sid="15" id="toadylion.c9.s15">Yet they fitted him very well.</s> <s sid="16" id="toadylion.c9.s16">He wore on his face (in addition to a slight moustache) an expression which somehow made Hugh John think guiltily of all the orchards he had ever visited along with Toady Lion and Sammy Carter's sister Cissy, who was "no end of a nice girl" in Hugh John's estimation.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="toadylion.c9.p10" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="toadylion.c9.s17"><qs/>"This, Hugh,"<qe/><sls/> said his father, with a little wave of his hand, <sle/><qs/>"is Mr. Mant, the Chief Constable of the county.</s> <s sid="18" id="toadylion.c9.s18">Mr. Carter and he have come to ask you a few questions, which you will answer at once."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="toadylion.c9.p11" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="toadylion.c9.s19"><qs/>"I won't be dasht-mean!"<qe/> muttered Napoleon Smith to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="toadylion.c9.p12" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="toadylion.c9.s20"><qs/>"What's that?"<qe/> ejaculated Mr. Smith, catching the echo of his son's rumble of dissent.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="toadylion.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="toadylion.c9.s21"><qs/>"Only my leg that hurted,"<qe/> said the hypocritical hero of battles.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="toadylion.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="toadylion.c9.s22"><qs/>"Don't you think we should have the other children here?"<qe/> said Mr. Chief Constable Mant, speaking for the first time in a gruff, move-on-there voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="toadylion.c9.p15" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="toadylion.c9.s23"><qs/>"Certainly,"<qe/> assented Mr. Smith, going to the door.</s> <s sid="24" id="toadylion.c9.s24"><qs/>"Janet!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="toadylion.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="toadylion.c9.s25"><qs/>"Yes, sir!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="toadylion.c9.p17"><s sid="26" id="toadylion.c9.s26">The answer came from immediately behind the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="toadylion.c9.p18"><s sid="27" id="toadylion.c9.s27">The Field-Marshal's brow darkened, or rather it would have done so if there had been no white bandages over it.</s> <s sid="28" id="toadylion.c9.s28">This is the correct expression anyhow--though ordinary brows but seldom behave in this manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="toadylion.c9.p19" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="toadylion.c9.s29"><qs/>"Prissy's all right,"<qe/><sss/> he thought to himself, <sse/><qs/>"but if that little fool Toady Lion----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="toadylion.c9.p20"><s sid="30" id="toadylion.c9.s30">And he clenched his second sorest hand under the clothes, and kicked Sambo Soulis to the foot of the bed in a way which augured but little mercy to Sir Toady Lion if, after all his training, he should turn out "dasht-mean" in the hour of trial.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="toadylion.c9.p21"><s sid="31" id="toadylion.c9.s31">Presently the other two children were pushed in at the door, Toady Lion trying a bolt at the last moment, which Janet Sheepshanks easily foiled by catching at the slack of his trousers behind, while Prissy stood holding her hands primly as if in Sunday-school class.</s> <s sid="32" id="toadylion.c9.s32">Both afforded to the critical eye of Hugh John complete evidence that they had only just escaped from the Greater Pain of the comb and soaped flannel-cloth of Janet Sheepshanks.</s> <s sid="33" id="toadylion.c9.s33">Prissy's curls were still wet and smoothed out, and Toady Lion was trying in vain to rub the yellow soap out of his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="toadylion.c9.p22"><s sid="34" id="toadylion.c9.s34">So at the headquarters of its general, the army of Windy Standard formed up.</s> <s sid="35" id="toadylion.c9.s35">Sir Toady Lion wished to get within supporting distance of Prissy, and accordingly kept snuggling nearer all the time, so that he could get a furtive hold of her skirts at awkward places in the examination.</s> <s sid="36" id="toadylion.c9.s36">This he could do the more easily that General Field-Marshal Smith was prevented by the bandages over his right eye, and also by the projecting edges of the pillow, from seeing Toady Lion's left hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="toadylion.c9.p23" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="toadylion.c9.s37"><qs/>"Now, Priscilla,"<qe/><sss/> began her father, <sse/><qs/>"tell Mr. Davenant Carter and Mr. Mant what happened in the castle, and the names of any of the bad boys who stole your pet lamb."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="toadylion.c9.p24" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="toadylion.c9.s38"><qs/>"Wasn't no lamb--Donald was a sheep, and he could fight,"<qe/> began Toady Lion, without relevance, but with his usual eagerness to hear the sound of his own piping voice.</s> <s sid="39" id="toadylion.c9.s39">In his zeal he took a step forward and so brought himself on the level of the eye of his general, who from the pillow darted upon him a look so freezing that Sir Toady Lion instantly fell back into the ranks, and clutched Prissy's skirt with such energy as almost to stagger her severe deportment.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="toadylion.c9.p25" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="toadylion.c9.s40"><qs/>"Now,"<qe/><sls/> said the Chief Constable of Bordershire, <sle/><qs/>"tell me what were the names of the assailants."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="toadylion.c9.p26"><s sid="41" id="toadylion.c9.s41">He was listening to the tale as told by Prissy with his note-book ready in his hand, occasionally biting at the butt of the pencil, and anon wetting the lead in his mouth, under the mistaken idea that by so doing he improved its writing qualities.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="toadylion.c9.p27" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="toadylion.c9.s42"><qs/>"I think,"<qe/><sss/> began Prissy, <sse/><qs/>"that they were----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="toadylion.c9.p28" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="toadylion.c9.s43"><qs/>"_A-chew!_"<qe/> came from the bed and from under the bandages with a sudden burst of sound.</s> <s sid="44" id="toadylion.c9.s44">Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith had sneezed.</s> <s sid="45" id="toadylion.c9.s45">That was all.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="toadylion.c9.p29"><s sid="46" id="toadylion.c9.s46">But Prissy started.</s> <s sid="47" id="toadylion.c9.s47">She knew what it meant.</s> <s sid="48" id="toadylion.c9.s48">It was the well-known signal not to commit herself under examination.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="toadylion.c9.p30"><s sid="49" id="toadylion.c9.s49">Her father looked round at the open windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="toadylion.c9.p31" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="toadylion.c9.s50"><qs/>"Are you catching cold with the draught, Hugh John?"<qe/> he asked kindly.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="toadylion.c9.p32" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="toadylion.c9.s51"><qs/>"I think I have a little cold,"<qe/> said the wily General, who did not wish all the windows to be promptly shut.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="toadylion.c9.p33" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="toadylion.c9.s52"><qs/>"Don't know all their names, but the one that hurted me was----"<qe/> began Toady Lion.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="toadylion.c9.p34"><s sid="53" id="toadylion.c9.s53">But who the villain was will never be known, for at that moment the bedclothes became violently disturbed immediately in front of Sir Toady Lion's nose.</s> <s sid="54" id="toadylion.c9.s54">A fearful black countenance nodded once at him and disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="toadylion.c9.p35" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="toadylion.c9.s55"><qs/>"Black Sambo!"<qe/> gasped Toady Lion, awed by the terrible appearance, and falling back from the place where the wizard had so suddenly appeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="toadylion.c9.p36" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="toadylion.c9.s56"><qs/>"What did I understand you to say, little boy?"<qe/> said Mr. Mant, with his pencil on his book.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="toadylion.c9.p37" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="toadylion.c9.s57"><qs/>"Ow--it was Black Sambo!"<qe/></s> <s sid="58" id="toadylion.c9.s58">Toady Lion almost screamed.</s> <s sid="59" id="toadylion.c9.s59">Mr. Mant gravely noted the fact.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="toadylion.c9.p38" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="toadylion.c9.s60"><qs/>"What in the world does he mean?"<qe/> asked Mr. Mant, casting his eyes searchingly from Prissy to General Napoleon and back again.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="toadylion.c9.p39" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="toadylion.c9.s61"><qs/>"He means 'Black Sambo'!"<qe/> said Prissy, devoting herself strictly to facts, and leaving the Chief Constable to his proper business of interpreting them.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="toadylion.c9.p40" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="toadylion.c9.s62"><qs/>"What is his other name?"<qe/> said Mr. Mant.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="toadylion.c9.p41" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="toadylion.c9.s63"><qs/>"Soulis!"<qe/> said General Smith from the bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="toadylion.c9.p42"><s sid="64" id="toadylion.c9.s64">The three gentlemen looked at each other, smiled, and shook their heads.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="toadylion.c9.p43" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="toadylion.c9.s65"><qs/>"What did I tell you?"<qe/> said Mr. Davenant Carter.</s> <s sid="66" id="toadylion.c9.s66"><qs/>"Try as I will, I cannot get the simplest thing out of my Sammy and Cissy if they don't choose to tell."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="toadylion.c9.p44"><s sid="67" id="toadylion.c9.s67">Nevertheless Mr. Smith, being a sanguine man and with little experience of children, tried again.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="toadylion.c9.p45" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="toadylion.c9.s68"><qs/>"There is no black boy in the neighbourhood,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Smith severely; <sse/><qs/>"now tell the truth, children--at once, when I bid you!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="toadylion.c9.p46"><s sid="69" id="toadylion.c9.s69">He uttered the last words in a loud and commanding tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="toadylion.c9.p47" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="toadylion.c9.s70"><qs/>"Us is telling the troof, father dear,"<qe/> said Toady Lion, in the "coaxy-woaxy" voice which he used when he wanted marmalade from Janet or a ride on the saddle from Mr. Picton Smith.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="toadylion.c9.p48" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="toadylion.c9.s71"><qs/>"Perhaps the boy had blackened his face to deceive the eye,"<qe/> suggested Mr. Mant, with the air of one familiar from infancy with the tricks and devices of the evil-minded of all ages.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="toadylion.c9.p49" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="toadylion.c9.s72"><qs/>"Was the ringleader's face blackened?--Answer at once!"<qe/> said Mr. Smith sternly.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="toadylion.c9.p50"><s sid="73" id="toadylion.c9.s73">The General extracted his bruised and battered right hand from under the clothes and looked at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="toadylion.c9.p51" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="toadylion.c9.s74"><qs/>"I think so,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"leastways some has come off on my knuckles!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="toadylion.c9.p52"><s sid="75" id="toadylion.c9.s75">Mr. Davenant Carter burst into a peal of jovial mirth.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="toadylion.c9.p53" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="toadylion.c9.s76"><qs/>"Didn't I tell you?--It isn't a bit of use badgering children when they don't want to tell.</s> <s sid="77" id="toadylion.c9.s77">Let's go over to the castle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="toadylion.c9.p54"><s sid="78" id="toadylion.c9.s78">And with that the three gentlemen went out, while Napoleon Smith, Prissy, and Sir Toady Lion were left alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="toadylion.c9.p55"><s sid="79" id="toadylion.c9.s79">The General beckoned them to his bedside with his nose--quite an easy thing to do if you have the right kind of nose, which Hugh John had.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="toadylion.c9.p56" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="toadylion.c9.s80"><qs/>"Now look here,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"if you'd told, I'd have jolly well flattened you when I got up.</s> <s sid="81" id="toadylion.c9.s81">'Tisn't our business to tell p'leecemen things."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="toadylion.c9.p58" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="toadylion.c9.s83"><qs/>"That's the worst kind,"<qe/><sls/> said the General in a low, hissing whisper; <sle/><qs/>"all the same you stood to it like bricks, and now I'm going to get well and begin on the campaign at once."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="toadylion.c9.p59" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="toadylion.c9.s84"><qs/>"Don't you be greedy-teeth and eat it all yourself!"<qe/> interjected Toady Lion, who thought that the campaign was something to eat, and that it sounded good.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="toadylion.c9.p60" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="toadylion.c9.s85"><qs/>"What are you going to do?"<qe/> said Prissy, who had a great belief in the executive ability of her brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="toadylion.c9.p65"><s sid="91" id="toadylion.c9.s91">And so the great soldier was left to his meditations in the darkened hospital chamber.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="toadylion.c10.p2"><s sid="4" id="toadylion.c10.s4">Hugh John had once been a member of the Comanche Cowboys, as Nipper Donnan's band was styled; but a disagreement about the objects of attack had hastened a rupture, and the affair of the castle was but the last act in a hostility long latent.</s> <s sid="5" id="toadylion.c10.s5">In fact the war was always simmering, and was ready to boil over on the slightest provocation.</s> <s sid="6" id="toadylion.c10.s6">For when Hugh John found that his father's orchards, his father's covers and hencoops were to be the chief prey (being safer than the farmers' yards, where there were big dogs always loose, and the town streets, where "bobbies" mostly congregated), he struck.</s> <s sid="7" id="toadylion.c10.s7">He reflected that one day all these things would belong to himself.</s> <s sid="8" id="toadylion.c10.s8">He would share with Prissy and Sir Toady Lion, of course; but still mainly they would belong to him.</s> <s sid="9" id="toadylion.c10.s9">Why then plunder them now?</s> <s sid="10" id="toadylion.c10.s10">The argument was utilitarian but sufficient.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="toadylion.c19.p11"><s sid="38" id="toadylion.c19.s38">Very gingerly he put his foot over the edge, and at once found himself on the top step of a steep, narrow, and exceedingly uneven stair.</s> <s sid="39" id="toadylion.c19.s39">The explorer's heart beat fast within him.</s> <s sid="40" id="toadylion.c19.s40">He knew what it was now that he had found--a secret passage, perhaps ending in an enchanted cave; perhaps (who knew) in a pirate's den.</s> <s sid="41" id="toadylion.c19.s41">He thought of Nipper Donnan's last words about the beast as big as a calf which his father had seen going down into the dungeon.</s> <s sid="42" id="toadylion.c19.s42">It was a lie, of course; it must be, because Nipper Donnan said it; but still it was certainly very dark and dismal down there.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="toadylion.c19.p17"><s sid="52" id="toadylion.c19.s52">In the afternoon Nipper had gone to Halkirk Tryst to bring home two bullocks, which Butcher Donnan had bought there the day before; but his father becoming involved in some critical cattle-dealing transaction, for which he was unable to obtain satisfaction in cash, resolved that Nipper should wait till the next day, when he hoped to be able to accompany him home in person.</s> <s sid="53" id="toadylion.c19.s53">So engrossed was Nipper with the freaks of the fair, the Aunt-Sallies, the shooting-galleries, and miscellaneous side-shows and ghost illusions, that he quite forgot all about our hero immured in the dungeon of the Castle of Windy Standard.</s> <s sid="54" id="toadylion.c19.s54">Even had he remembered, he would certainly have said to himself that some of the other boys would be sure to go and let him out (for which interference with his privileges he would assuredly punch their heads to-morrow!)--and that in any case it served the beggar right.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="toadylion.c19.p18"><s sid="55" id="toadylion.c19.s55">Probably, however, his father (had Nipper thought fit to mention the matter to him), would have taken quite a different view of the situation; for the butcher, with all his detestation of the owner of the Windy Standard estate, held Mr. Picton Smith in a wholesome awe which almost amounted to reverence.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="toadylion.c19.p19"><s sid="56" id="toadylion.c19.s56">So it came about that none approached the castle all that afternoon; for the boys of Nipper's band were afraid to venture upon the castle island in the absence of their redoubtable chief, while the servants of Windy Standard House sought for the vanished in quite other directions, being led astray by the innocent assertions of Toady Lion, who had last seen Hugh John defending himself gallantly against overwhelming numbers in the corner of the field nearest to the town, and at least half a mile as the crow flies from the castle on the island.</s> </p>
