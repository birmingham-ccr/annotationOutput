<qe/><title>INTRODUCTION.</title>
<p pid="1" id="maisie.c0.p1"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c0.s1">The litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated; but by the decision on the appeal the judgement of the divorce-court was confirmed as to the assignment of the child.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c0.s2">The father, who, though bespattered from head to foot, had made good his case, was, in pursuance of this triumph, appointed to keep her: it was not so much that the mother's character had been more absolutely damaged as that the brilliancy of a lady's complexion (and this lady's, in court, was immensely remarked) might be more regarded as showing the spots.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c0.s3">Attached, however, to the second pronouncement was a condition that detracted, for Beale Farange, from its sweetness--an order that he should refund to his late wife the twenty-six hundred pounds put down by her, as it was called, some three years before, in the interest of the child's maintenance and precisely on a proved understanding that he would take no proceedings: a sum of which he had had the administration and of which he could render not the least account.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c0.s4">The obligation thus attributed to her adversary was no small balm to Ida's resentment; it drew a part of the sting from her defeat and compelled Mr. Farange perceptibly to lower his crest.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c0.s5">He was unable to produce the money or to raise it in any way; so that after a squabble scarcely less public and scarcely more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue from his predicament was a compromise proposed by his legal advisers and finally accepted by hers.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c0.p2"><s sid="6" id="maisie.c0.s6">His debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl disposed of in a manner worthy of the judgement-seat of Solomon.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c0.s7">She was divided in two and the portions tossed impartially to the disputants.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c0.s8">They would take her, in rotation, for six months at a time; she would spend half the year with each.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c0.s9">This was odd justice in the eyes of those who still blinked in the fierce light projected from the tribunal--a light in which neither parent figured in the least as a happy example to youth and innocence.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c0.s10">What was to have been expected on the evidence was the nomination, _in loco parentis_, of some proper third person, some respectable or at least some presentable friend.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c0.s11">Apparently, however, the circle of the Faranges had been scanned in vain for any such ornament; so that the only solution finally meeting all the difficulties was, save that of sending Maisie to a Home, the partition of the tutelary office in the manner I have mentioned.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c0.s12">There were more reasons for her parents to agree to it than there had ever been for them to agree to anything; and they now prepared with her help to enjoy the distinction that waits upon vulgarity sufficiently attested.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c0.s13">Their rupture had resounded, and after being perfectly insignificant together they would be decidedly striking apart.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c0.s14">Had they not produced an impression that warranted people in looking for appeals in the newspapers for the rescue of the little one--reverberation, amid a vociferous public, of the idea that some movement should be started or some benevolent person should come forward?</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c0.s15">A good lady came indeed a step or two: she was distantly related to Mrs. Farange, to whom she proposed that, having children and nurseries wound up and going, she should be allowed to take home the bone of contention and, by working it into her system, relieve at least one of the parents.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c0.s16">This would make every time, for Maisie, after her inevitable six months with Beale, much more of a change.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c0.p3" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="maisie.c0.s17"><qs/>"More of a change?"<qe/></s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c0.s18">Ida cried.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c0.s19"><qs/>"Won't it be enough of a change for her to come from that low brute to the person in the world who detests him most?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c0.p4" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="maisie.c0.s20"><qs/>"No, because you detest him so much that you'll always talk to her about him.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c0.s21">You'll keep him before her by perpetually abusing him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c0.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="maisie.c0.s22">Mrs. Farange stared.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c0.s23"><qs/>"Pray, then, am I to do nothing to counteract his villainous abuse of ME?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c0.p6" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="maisie.c0.s24">The good lady, for a moment, made no reply: her silence was a grim judgement of the whole point of view.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c0.s25"><qs/>"Poor little monkey!"<qe/> she at last exclaimed; and the words were an epitaph for the tomb of Maisie's childhood.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c0.s26">She was abandoned to her fate.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c0.s27">What was clear to any spectator was that the only link binding her to either parent was this lamentable fact of her being a ready vessel for bitterness, a deep little porcelain cup in which biting acids could be mixed.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c0.s28">They had wanted her not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they could, with her unconscious aid, do each other.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c0.s29">She should serve their anger and seal their revenge, for husband and wife had been alike crippled by the heavy hand of justice, which in the last resort met on neither side their indignant claim to get, as they called it, everything.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c0.s30">If each was only to get half this seemed to concede that neither was so base as the other pretended, or, to put it differently, offered them both as bad indeed, since they were only as good as each other.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c0.s31">The mother had wished to prevent the father from, as she said, "so much as looking" at the child; the father's plea was that the mother's lightest touch was <qs/>"simply contamination."<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c0.s32">These were the opposed principles in which Maisie was to be educated--she was to fit them together as she might.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c0.s33">Nothing could have been more touching at first than her failure to suspect the ordeal that awaited her little unspotted soul.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c0.s34">There were persons horrified to think what those in charge of it would combine to try to make of it: no one could conceive in advance that they would be able to make nothing ill.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c0.p7"><s sid="35" id="maisie.c0.s35">This was a society in which for the most part people were occupied only with chatter, but the disunited couple had at last grounds for expecting a time of high activity.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c0.s36">They girded their loins, they felt as if the quarrel had only begun.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c0.s37">They felt indeed more married than ever, inasmuch as what marriage had mainly suggested to them was the unbroken opportunity to quarrel.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c0.s38">There had been "sides" before, and there were sides as much as ever; for the sider too the prospect opened out, taking the pleasant form of a superabundance of matter for desultory conversation.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c0.s39">The many friends of the Faranges drew together to differ about them; contradiction grew young again over teacups and cigars.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c0.s40">Everybody was always assuring everybody of something very shocking, and nobody would have been jolly if nobody had been outrageous.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c0.s41">The pair appeared to have a social attraction which failed merely as regards each other: it was indeed a great deal to be able to say for Ida that no one but Beale desired her blood, and for Beale that if he should ever have his eyes scratched out it would be only by his wife.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c0.s42">It was generally felt, to begin with, that they were awfully good-looking--they had really not been analysed to a deeper residuum.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c0.s43">They made up together for instance some twelve feet three of stature, and nothing was more discussed than the apportionment of this quantity.</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c0.s44">The sole flaw in Ida's beauty was a length and reach of arm conducive perhaps to her having so often beaten her ex-husband at billiards, a game in which she showed a superiority largely accountable, as she maintained, for the resentment finding expression in his physical violence.</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c0.s45">Billiards was her great accomplishment and the distinction her name always first produced the mention of.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c0.s46">Notwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might have been large and that in many women profited by the licence was, with a single exception, admired and cited for its smallness.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c0.s47">The exception was her eyes, which might have been of mere regulation size, but which overstepped the modesty of nature; her mouth, on the other hand, was barely perceptible, and odds were freely taken as to the measurement of her waist.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c0.s48">She was a person who, when she was out--and she was always out--produced everywhere a sense of having been seen often, the sense indeed of a kind of abuse of visibility, so that it would have been, in the usual places rather vulgar to wonder at her.</s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c0.s49">Strangers only did that; but they, to the amusement of the familiar, did it very much: it was an inevitable way of betraying an alien habit.</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c0.s50">Like her husband she carried clothes, carried them as a train carries passengers: people had been known to compare their taste and dispute about the accommodation they gave these articles, though inclining on the whole to the commendation of Ida as less overcrowded, especially with jewellery and flowers.</s> <s sid="51" id="maisie.c0.s51">Beale Farange had natural decorations, a kind of costume in his vast fair beard, burnished like a gold breastplate, and in the eternal glitter of the teeth that his long moustache had been trained not to hide and that gave him, in every possible situation, the look of the joy of life.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c0.s52">He had been destined in his youth for diplomacy and momentarily attached, without a salary, to a legation which enabled him often to say "In MY time in the East": but contemporary history had somehow had no use for him, had hurried past him and left him in perpetual Piccadilly.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c0.s53">Every one knew what he had--only twenty-five hundred.</s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c0.s54">Poor Ida, who had run through everything, had now nothing but her carriage and her paralysed uncle.</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c0.s55">This old brute, as he was called, was supposed to have a lot put away.</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c0.s56">The child was provided for, thanks to a crafty godmother, a defunct aunt of Beale's, who had left her something in such a manner that the parents could appropriate only the income.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="maisie.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c1.s1">The child was provided for, but the new arrangement was inevitably confounding to a young intelligence intensely aware that something had happened which must matter a good deal and looking anxiously out for the effects of so great a cause.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c1.s2">It was to be the fate of this patient little girl to see much more than she at first understood, but also even at first to understand much more than any little girl, however patient, had perhaps ever understood before.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c1.s3">Only a drummer-boy in a ballad or a story could have been so in the thick of the fight.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c1.s4">She was taken into the confidence of passions on which she fixed just the stare she might have had for images bounding across the wall in the slide of a magic-lantern.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c1.s5">Her little world was phantasmagoric--strange shadows dancing on a sheet.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c1.s6">It was as if the whole performance had been given for her--a mite of a half-scared infant in a great dim theatre.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c1.s7">She was in short introduced to life with a liberality in which the selfishness of others found its account, and there was nothing to avert the sacrifice but the modesty of her youth.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="maisie.c1.s8">Her first term was with her father, who spared her only in not letting her have the wild letters addressed to her by her mother: he confined himself to holding them up at her and shaking them, while he showed his teeth, and then amusing her by the way he chucked them, across the room, bang into the fire.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c1.s9">Even at that moment, however, she had a scared anticipation of fatigue, a guilty sense of not rising to the occasion, feeling the charm of the violence with which the stiff unopened envelopes, whose big monograms--Ida bristled with monograms--she would have liked to see, were made to whizz, like dangerous missiles, through the air.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c1.s10">The greatest effect of the great cause was her own greater importance, chiefly revealed to her in the larger freedom with which she was handled, pulled hither and thither and kissed, and the proportionately greater niceness she was obliged to show.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c1.s11">Her features had somehow become prominent; they were so perpetually nipped by the gentlemen who came to see her father and the smoke of whose cigarettes went into her face.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c1.s12">Some of these gentlemen made her strike matches and light their cigarettes; others, holding her on knees violently jolted, pinched the calves of her legs till she shrieked--her shriek was much admired--and reproached them with being toothpicks.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c1.s13">The word stuck in her mind and contributed to her feeling from this time that she was deficient in something that would meet the general desire.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c1.s14">She found out what it was: it was a congenital tendency to the production of a substance to which Moddle, her nurse, gave a short ugly name, a name painfully associated at dinner with the part of the joint that she didn't like.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c1.s15">She had left behind her the time when she had no desires to meet, none at least save Moddle's, who, in Kensington Gardens, was always on the bench when she came back to see if she had been playing too far.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c1.s16">Moddle's desire was merely that she shouldn't do that, and she met it so easily that the only spots in that long brightness were the moments of her wondering what would become of her if, on her rushing back, there should be no Moddle on the bench.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c1.s17">They still went to the Gardens, but there was a difference even there; she was impelled perpetually to look at the legs of other children and ask her nurse if THEY were toothpicks.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c1.s18">Moddle was terribly truthful; she always said:</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c1.s19"><qs/>"Oh my dear, you'll not find such another pair as your own."<qe/></s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c1.s20">It seemed to have to do with something else that Moddle often said:</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c1.s21"><qs/>"You feel the strain--that's where it is; and you'll feel it still worse, you know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="maisie.c1.s22">Thus from the first Maisie not only felt it, but knew she felt it.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c1.s23">A part of it was the consequence of her father's telling her he felt it too, and telling Moddle, in her presence, that she must make a point of driving that home.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c1.s24">She was familiar, at the age of six, with the fact that everything had been changed on her account, everything ordered to enable him to give himself up to her.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c1.s25">She was to remember always the words in which Moddle impressed upon her that he did so give himself:</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c1.s26"><qs/>"Your papa wishes you never to forget, you know, that he has been dreadfully put about."<qe/></s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c1.s27">If the skin on Moddle's face had to Maisie the air of being unduly, almost painfully, stretched, it never presented that appearance so much as when she uttered, as she often had occasion to utter, such words.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c1.s28">The child wondered if they didn't make it hurt more than usual; but it was only after some time that she was able to attach to the picture of her father's sufferings, and more particularly to her nurse's manner about them, the meaning for which these things had waited.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c1.s29">By the time she had grown sharper, as the gentlemen who had criticised her calves used to say, she found in her mind a collection of images and echoes to which meanings were attachable--images and echoes kept for her in the childish dusk, the dim closet, the high drawers, like games she wasn't yet big enough to play.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c1.s30">The great strain meanwhile was that of carrying by the right end the things her father said about her mother--things mostly indeed that Moddle, on a glimpse of them, as if they had been complicated toys or difficult books, took out of her hands and put away in the closet.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c1.s31">A wonderful assortment of objects of this kind she was to discover there later, all tumbled up too with the things, shuffled into the same receptacle, that her mother had said about her father.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="maisie.c1.s32">She had the knowledge that on a certain occasion which every day brought nearer her mother would be at the door to take her away, and this would have darkened all the days if the ingenious Moddle hadn't written on a paper in very big easy words ever so many pleasures that she would enjoy at the other house.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c1.s33">These promises ranged from "a mother's fond love" to <qs/>"a nice poached egg to your tea,"<qe/> and took by the way the prospect of sitting up ever so late to see the lady in question dressed, in silks and velvets and diamonds and pearls, to go out: so that it was a real support to Maisie, at the supreme hour, to feel how, by Moddle's direction, the paper was thrust away in her pocket and there clenched in her fist.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c1.s34">The supreme hour was to furnish her with a vivid reminiscence, that of a strange outbreak in the drawing-room on the part of Moddle, who, in reply to something her father had just said, cried aloud:</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c1.s35"><qs/>"You ought to be perfectly ashamed of yourself--you ought to blush, sir, for the way you go on!"<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c1.s36">The carriage, with her mother in it, was at the door; a gentleman who was there, who was always there, laughed out very loud; her father, who had her in his arms, said to Moddle:</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c1.s37"><qs/>"My dear woman, I'll settle you presently!"<qe/>--after which he repeated, showing his teeth more than ever at Maisie while he hugged her, the words for which her nurse had taken him up.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c1.s38">Maisie was not at the moment so fully conscious of them as of the wonder of Moddle's sudden disrespect and crimson face; but she was able to produce them in the course of five minutes when, in the carriage, her mother, all kisses, ribbons, eyes, arms, strange sounds and sweet smells, said to her:</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c1.s39"><qs/>"And did your beastly papa, my precious angel, send any message to your own loving mamma?"<qe/></s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c1.s40">Then it was that she found the words spoken by her beastly papa to be, after all, in her little bewildered ears, from which, at her mother's appeal, they passed, in her clear shrill voice, straight to her little innocent lips.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c1.s41"><qs/>"He said I was to tell you, from him,"<qe/><sss/> she faithfully reported, <sse/><qs/>"that you're a nasty horrid pig!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c2.s1">In that lively sense of the immediate which is the very air of a child's mind the past, on each occasion, became for her as indistinct as the future: she surrendered herself to the actual with a good faith that might have been touching to either parent.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c2.s2">Crudely as they had calculated they were at first justified by the event: she was the little feathered shuttlecock they could fiercely keep flying between them.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c2.s3">The evil they had the gift of thinking or pretending to think of each other they poured into her little gravely-gazing soul as into a boundless receptacle, and each of them had doubtless the best conscience in the world as to the duty of teaching her the stern truth that should be her safeguard against the other.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c2.s4">She was at the age for which all stories are true and all conceptions are stories.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c2.s5">The actual was the absolute, the present alone was vivid.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c2.s6">The objurgation for instance launched in the carriage by her mother after she had at her father's bidding punctually performed was a missive that dropped into her memory with the dry rattle of a letter falling into a pillar-box.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c2.s7">Like the letter it was, as part of the contents of a well-stuffed post-bag, delivered in due course at the right address.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c2.s8">In the presence of these overflowings, after they had continued for a couple of years, the associates of either party sometimes felt that something should be done for what they called <qs/>"the real good, don't you know?"<qe/> of the child.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c2.s9">The only thing done, however, in general, took place when it was sighingly remarked that she fortunately wasn't all the year round where she happened to be at the awkward moment, and that, furthermore, either from extreme cunning or from extreme stupidity, she appeared not to take things in.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="maisie.c2.s10">The theory of her stupidity, eventually embraced by her parents, corresponded with a great date in her small still life: the complete vision, private but final, of the strange office she filled.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c2.s11">It was literally a moral revolution and accomplished in the depths of her nature.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c2.s12">The stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms and legs; old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened her.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c2.s13">She had a new feeling, the feeling of danger; on which a new remedy rose to meet it, the idea of an inner self or, in other words, of concealment.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c2.s14">She puzzled out with imperfect signs, but with a prodigious spirit, that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult, and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c2.s15">Her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed no longer.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c2.s16">She would forget everything, she would repeat nothing, and when, as a tribute to the successful application of her system, she began to be called a little idiot, she tasted a pleasure new and keen.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c2.s17">When therefore, as she grew older, her parents in turn announced before her that she had grown shockingly dull, it was not from any real contraction of her little stream of life.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c2.s18">She spoiled their fun, but she practically added to her own.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c2.s19">She saw more and more; she saw too much.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c2.s20">It was Miss Overmore, her first governess, who on a momentous occasion had sown the seeds of secrecy; sown them not by anything she said, but by a mere roll of those fine eyes which Maisie already admired.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c2.s21">Moddle had become at this time, after alternations of residence of which the child had no clear record, an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the alphabet, sad embarrassments, in particular, when invited to recognise something her nurse described as <qs/>"the important letter haitch."<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c2.s22">Miss Overmore, however hungry, never disappeared: this marked her somehow as of higher rank, and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that Maisie supposed to be extraordinary.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c2.s23">Mrs. Farange had described her as almost too pretty, and some one had asked what that mattered so long as Beale wasn't there.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c2.s24"><qs/>"Beale or no Beale,"<qe/><sls/> Maisie had heard her mother reply, <sle/><qs/>"I take her because she's a lady and yet awfully poor.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c2.s25">Rather nice people, but there are seven sisters at home.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c2.s26">What do people mean?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c5.p2" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="maisie.c5.s14">The brougham was a token of harmony, of the fine conditions papa would this time offer: he had usually come for her in a hansom, with a four-wheeler behind for the boxes.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c5.s15">The four-wheeler with the boxes on it was actually there, but mamma was the only lady with whom she had ever been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by Moddle as a private carriage.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c5.s16">Papa's carriage was, now that he had one, still more private, somehow, than mamma's; and when at last she found herself quite on top, as she felt, of its inmates and gloriously rolling away, she put to Miss Overmore, after another immense and talkative squeeze, a question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the continuity of a certain sentiment.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c5.s17"><qs/>"Did papa like you just the same while I was gone?"<qe/> she enquired--full of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c5.s18">She had bethought herself that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be only intermittent and for the season.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c5.s19">Papa, on whose knee she sat, burst into one of those loud laughs of his that, however prepared she was, seemed always, like some trick in a frightening game, to leap forth and make her jump.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c5.s20">Before Miss Overmore could speak he replied:</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c5.s21"><qs/>"Why, you little donkey, when you're away what have I left to do but just to love her?"<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c5.s22">Miss Overmore hereupon immediately took her from him, and they had a merry little scrimmage over her of which Maisie caught the surprised perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c5.s23">Then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely:</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c5.s24"><qs/>"I shall make him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that to you I shall carry you straight off and we'll go and live somewhere together and be good quiet little girls."<qe/></s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c5.s25">The child couldn't quite make out why her father's speech had been horrid, since it only expressed that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as <qs/>"immense."<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c5.s26">To enter more into the truth of the matter she appealed to him again directly, asked if in all those months Miss Overmore hadn't been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c5.s27"><qs/>"Of course she has, old girl--where else could the poor dear be?"<qe/> cried Beale Farange, to the still greater scandal of their companion, who protested that unless he straightway "took back" his nasty wicked fib it would be, this time, not only him she would leave, but his child too and his house and his tiresome trouble--all the impossible things he had succeeded in putting on her.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c5.s28">Beale, under this frolic menace, took nothing back at all; he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating his extravagance, but Miss Overmore instructed her little charge that she was not to listen to his bad jokes: she was to understand that a lady couldn't stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper reason.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c5.p3" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="maisie.c5.s29">Maisie looked from one of her companions to the other; this was the freshest gayest start she had yet enjoyed, but she had a shy fear of not exactly believing them.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c5.s30"><qs/>"Well, what reason IS proper?"<qe/> she thoughtfully demanded.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c5.p4" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="maisie.c5.s31"><qs/>"Oh a long-legged stick of a tomboy: there's none so good as that."<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c5.s32">Her father enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get possession of her--an effort deprecated by their comrade and leading again to something of a public scuffle.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c5.s33">Miss Overmore declared to the child that she had been all the while with good friends; on which Beale Farange went on:</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c5.s34"><qs/>"She means good friends of mine, you know--tremendous friends of mine.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c5.s35">There has been no end of THEM about--that I WILL say for her!"<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c5.s36">Maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time conscious of a vagueness, just slightly embarrassing, as to the subject of so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c5.s37">She didn't feel at all as if she had been seriously told, and no such feeling was supplied by anything that occurred later.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c5.s38">Her embarrassment, of a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that this was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used to say, to go into.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c5.s39">Therefore, under her father's roof during the time that followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an ingratiating way with housemaids; and it was an odd truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by renewed contact with Miss Overmore.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c5.s40">The confidence looked for by that young lady was of the fine sort that explanation can't improve, and she herself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c5.s41">For Maisie moreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception; she had grown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that she was never to ask about them.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c5.s42">It was far from new to her that the questions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great: except the affairs of her doll Lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at her mother's that was explicable with a grave face.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c5.s43">Nothing was so easy to her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks, and she might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more calculating turn.</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c5.s44">Everything had something behind it: life was like a long, long corridor with rows of closed doors.</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c5.s45">She had learned that at these doors it was wise not to knock--this seemed to produce from within such sounds of derision.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c5.s46">Little by little, however, she understood more, for it befell that she was enlightened by Lisette's questions, which reproduced the effect of her own upon those for whom she sat in the very darkness of Lisette.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c5.s47">Was she not herself convulsed by such innocence?</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c5.s48">In the presence of it she often imitated the shrieking ladies.</s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c5.s49">There were at any rate things she really couldn't tell even a French doll.</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c5.s50">She could only pass on her lessons and study to produce on Lisette the impression of having mysteries in her life, wondering the while whether she succeeded in the air of shading off, like her mother, into the unknowable.</s> <s sid="51" id="maisie.c5.s51">When the reign of Miss Overmore followed that of Mrs. Wix she took a fresh cue, emulating her governess and bridging over the interval with the simple expectation of trust.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c5.s52">Yes, there were matters one couldn't "go into" with a pupil.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c5.s53">There were for instance days when, after prolonged absence, Lisette, watching her take off her things, tried hard to discover where she had been.</s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c5.s54">Well, she discovered a little, but never discovered all.</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c5.s55">There was an occasion when, on her being particularly indiscreet, Maisie replied to her--and precisely about the motive of a disappearance--as she, Maisie, had once been replied to by Mrs. Farange:</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c5.s56"><qs/>"Find out for yourself!"<qe/></s> <s sid="57" id="maisie.c5.s57">She mimicked her mother's sharpness, but she was rather ashamed afterwards, though as to whether of the sharpness or of the mimicry was not quite clear.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER VI.</title>
<p pid="1" id="maisie.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c6.s1">She became aware in time that this phase wouldn't have shone by lessons, the care of her education being now only one of the many duties devolving on Miss Overmore; a devolution as to which she was present at various passages between that lady and her father--passages significant, on either side, of dissent and even of displeasure.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c6.s2">It was gathered by the child on these occasions that there was something in the situation for which her mother might "come down" on them all, though indeed the remark, always dropped by her father, was greeted on his companion's part with direct contradiction.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c6.s3">Such scenes were usually brought to a climax by Miss Overmore's demanding, with more asperity than she applied to any other subject, in what position under the sun such a person as Mrs. Farange would find herself for coming down.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c6.s4">As the months went on the little girl's interpretations thickened, and the more effectually that this stretch was the longest she had known without a break.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c6.s5">She got used to the idea that her mother, for some reason, was in no hurry to reinstate her: that idea was forcibly expressed by her father whenever Miss Overmore, differing and decided, took him up on the question, which he was always putting forward, of the urgency of sending her to school.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c6.s6">For a governess Miss Overmore differed surprisingly; far more for instance than would have entered into the bowed head of Mrs. Wix.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c6.s7">She observed to Maisie many times that she was quite conscious of not doing her justice, and that Mr. Farange equally measured and equally lamented this deficiency.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c6.s8">The reason of it was that she had mysterious responsibilities that interfered--responsibilities, Miss Overmore intimated, to Mr. Farange himself and to the friendly noisy little house and those who came there.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c6.s9">Mr. Farange's remedy for every inconvenience was that the child should be put at school--there were such lots of splendid schools, as everybody knew, at Brighton and all over the place.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c6.s10">That, however, Maisie learned, was just what would bring her mother down: from the moment he should delegate to others the housing of his little charge he hadn't a leg to stand on before the law.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c6.s11">Didn't he keep her away from her mother precisely because Mrs. Farange was one of these others?</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c6.p2" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="maisie.c6.s12">There was also the solution of a second governess, a young person to come in by the day and really do the work; but to this Miss Overmore wouldn't for a moment listen, arguing against it with great public relish and wanting to know from all comers--she put it even to Maisie herself--they didn't see how frightfully it would give her away.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c6.s13"><qs/>"What am I supposed to be at all, don't you see, if I'm not here to look after her?"<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c6.s14">She was in a false position and so freely and loudly called attention to it that it seemed to become almost a source of glory.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c6.s15">The way out of it of course was just to do her plain duty; but that was unfortunately what, with his excessive, his exorbitant demands on her, which every one indeed appeared quite to understand, he practically, he selfishly prevented.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c6.s16">Beale Farange, for Miss Overmore, was now never anything but <qs/>"he,"<qe/> and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom, under that designation, she chaffingly talked about him.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c6.s17">Maisie meanwhile, as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done with her, was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful thought of the large loose discipline of Mrs. Wix; yet she none the less held it under her father's roof a point of superiority that none of his visitors were ladies.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c6.s18">It added to this odd security that she had once heard a gentleman say to him as if it were a great joke and in obvious reference to Miss Overmore:</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c6.s19"><qs/>"Hanged if she'll let another woman come near you--hanged if she ever will.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c6.s20">She'd let fly a stick at her as they do at a strange cat!"<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c6.s21">Maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates in spite of their also having their way--louder but sooner over--of laughing out at her.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c6.s22">They pulled and pinched, they teased and tickled her; some of them even, as they termed it, shied things at her, and all of them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to her own.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c6.s23">The ladies on the other hand addressed her as "You poor pet" and scarcely touched her even to kiss her.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c6.s24">But it was of the ladies she was most afraid.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c6.p3" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="maisie.c6.s25">She was now old enough to understand how disproportionate a stay she had already made with her father; and also old enough to enter a little into the ambiguity attending this excess, which oppressed her particularly whenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c6.s26"><qs/>"Oh you needn't worry: she doesn't care!"<qe/></s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c6.s27">Miss Overmore had often said to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her prolonged detention.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c6.s28"><qs/>"She has other people than poor little YOU to think about, and has gone abroad with them; so you needn't be in the least afraid she'll stickle this time for her rights."<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c6.s29">Maisie knew Mrs. Farange had gone abroad, for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter from her beginning "My precious pet" and taking leave of her for an indeterminate time; but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred or of the writer's policy of asserting herself, for the sharpest of all her impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever care so much about as to torment Mr. Farange.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c6.s30">What at last, however, was in this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a suspicion that a better way had been found to torment Mr. Farange than to deprive him of his periodical burden.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c6.s31">This was the question that worried our young lady and that Miss Overmore's confidences and the frequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying.</s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c6.s32">It was a contradiction that if Ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights she had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldn't jump at the monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely fought; but when Maisie, with a subtlety beyond her years, sounded this new ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly abused.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c6.s33">Miss Overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent reserve, but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness not inferior to Beale's own on the subject of the lady who had fled to the Continent to wriggle out of her job.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c6.s34">It would serve this lady right, Maisie gathered, if that contract, in the shape of an overgrown and underdressed daughter, should be shipped straight out to her and landed at her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c6.p4" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="maisie.c6.s35">The picture of these pursuits was what Miss Overmore took refuge in when the child tried timidly to ascertain if her father were disposed to feel he had too much of her.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c6.s36">She evaded the point and only kicked up all round it the dust of Ida's heartlessness and folly, of which the supreme proof, it appeared, was the fact that she was accompanied on her journey by a gentleman whom, to be painfully plain on it, she had--well, <qs/>"picked up."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c6.s37">The terms on which, unless they were married, ladies and gentlemen might, as Miss Overmore expressed it, knock about together, were the terms on which she and Mr. Farange had exposed themselves to possible misconception.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c6.s38">She had indeed, as has been noted, often explained this before, often said to Maisie:</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c6.s39"><qs/>"I don't know what in the world, darling, your father and I should do without you, for you just make the difference, as I've told you, of keeping us perfectly proper."<qe/></s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c6.s40">The child took in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she performed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the event of her mother's giving her up.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c6.s41">Familiar as she had grown with the fact of the great alternative to the proper, she felt in her governess and her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c6.s42">At the same time she had heard somehow of little girls--of exalted rank, it was true--whose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex, and she knew that if she were at school at Brighton it would be thought an advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c6.s43">She turned these things over and remarked to Miss Overmore that if she should go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c7.s1">It quite fell in with this intensity that one day, on returning from a walk with the housemaid, Maisie should have found her in the hall, seated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraph-boys who haunted Beale Farange's door and kicked their heels while, in his room, answers to their missives took form with the aid of smoke-puffs and growls.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c7.s2">It had seemed to her on their parting that Mrs. Wix had reached the last limits of the squeeze, but she now felt those limits to be transcended and that the duration of her visitor's hug was a direct reply to Miss Overmore's veto.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c7.s3">She understood in a flash how the visit had come to be possible--that Mrs. Wix, watching her chance, must have slipped in under protection of the fact that papa, always tormented in spite of arguments with the idea of a school, had, for a three days' excursion to Brighton, absolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c7.s4">It was true that when Maisie explained their absence and their important motive Mrs. Wix wore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in surprise.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c7.s5">This contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish, for at the very moment that, in the spirit of it, she threw herself afresh upon her young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the door and Miss Overmore bounded out.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c7.s6">The shock of her encounter with Mrs. Wix was less violent than Maisie had feared on seeing her and didn't at all interfere with the sociable tone in which, under her rival's eyes, she explained to her little charge that she had returned, for a particular reason, a day sooner than she first intended.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c7.s7">She had left papa--in such nice lodgings--at Brighton; but he would come back to his dear little home on the morrow.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c7.s8">As for Mrs. Wix, papa's companion supplied Maisie in later converse with the right word for the attitude of this personage:</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c7.s9">Mrs. Wix "stood up" to her in a manner that the child herself felt at the time to be astonishing.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c7.s10">This occurred indeed after Miss Overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the dining-room, where, in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down, it was scarcely more than natural that even poor Mrs. Wix should stand up.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c7.s11">Maisie at once enquired if at Brighton, this time, anything had come of the possibility of a school; to which, much to her surprise, Miss Overmore, who had always grandly repudiated it, replied after an instant, but quite as if Mrs. Wix were not there:</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="maisie.c7.s12"><qs/>"It may be, darling, that something WILL come.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c7.s13">The objection, I must tell you, has been quite removed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="maisie.c7.s14">At this it was still more startling to hear Mrs. Wix speak out with great firmness.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c7.s15"><qs/>"I don't think, if you'll allow me to say so, that there's any arrangement by which the objection CAN be <alt-qs/>'removed.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c7.s16">What has brought me here to-day is that I've a message for Maisie from dear Mrs. Farange."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c7.p4" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="maisie.c7.s17">The child's heart gave a great thump.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c7.s18"><qs/>"Oh mamma's come back?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="maisie.c7.s19"><qs/>"Not yet, sweet love, but she's coming,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Wix, <sse/><qs/>"and she has--most thoughtfully, you know--sent me on to prepare you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="maisie.c7.s20"><qs/>"To prepare her for what, pray?"<qe/> asked Miss Overmore, whose first smoothness began, with this news, to be ruffled.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="maisie.c7.s21">Mrs. Wix quietly applied her straighteners to Miss Overmore's flushed beauty.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c7.s22"><qs/>"Well, miss, for a very important communication."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="maisie.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="maisie.c7.s23"><qs/>"Can't dear Mrs. Farange, as you so oddly call her, make her communications directly?</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c7.s24">Can't she take the trouble to write to her only daughter?"<qe/> the younger lady demanded.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c7.s25"><qs/>"Maisie herself will tell you that it's months and months since she has had so much as a word from her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="maisie.c7.p9" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="maisie.c7.s26"><qs/>"Oh but I've written to mamma!"<qe/> cried the child as if this would do quite as well.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="maisie.c7.p10" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="maisie.c7.s27"><qs/>"That makes her treatment of you all the greater scandal,"<qe/> the governess in possession promptly declared.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="maisie.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="maisie.c7.s28"><qs/>"Mrs. Farange is too well aware,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Wix with sustained spirit, <sle/><qs/>"of what becomes of her letters in this house."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="maisie.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="maisie.c7.s29">Maisie's sense of fairness hereupon interposed for her visitor.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c7.s30"><qs/>"You know, Miss Overmore, that papa doesn't like everything of mamma's."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="maisie.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="maisie.c7.s31"><qs/>"No one likes, my dear, to be made the subject of such language as your mother's letters contain.</s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c7.s32">They were not fit for the innocent child to see,"<qe/> Miss Overmore observed to Mrs. Wix.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="maisie.c7.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="maisie.c7.s33"><qs/>"Then I don't know what you complain of, and she's better without them.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c7.s34">It serves every purpose that I'm in Mrs. Farange's confidence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="maisie.c7.p15" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="maisie.c7.s35">Miss Overmore gave a scornful laugh.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c7.s36"><qs/>"Then you must be mixed up with some extraordinary proceedings!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="maisie.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="maisie.c7.s37"><qs/>"None so extraordinary,"<qe/><sls/> cried Mrs. Wix, turning very pale, <sle/><qs/>"as to say horrible things about the mother to the face of the helpless daughter!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="maisie.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="maisie.c7.s38"><qs/>"Things not a bit more horrible, I think,"<qe/><sss/> Miss Overmore returned, <sse/><qs/>"than those you, madam, appear to have come here to say about the father!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="maisie.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="maisie.c7.s39">Mrs. Wix looked for a moment hard at Maisie, and then, turning again to this witness, spoke with a trembling voice.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c7.s40"><qs/>"I came to say nothing about him, and you must excuse Mrs. Farange and me if we're not so above all reproach as the companion of his travels."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="maisie.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="maisie.c7.s41">The young woman thus described stared at the apparent breadth of the description--she needed a moment to take it in.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c7.s42">Maisie, however, gazing solemnly from one of the disputants to the other, noted that her answer, when it came, perched upon smiling lips.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c7.s43"><qs/>"It will do quite as well, no doubt, if you come up to the requirements of the companion of Mrs. Farange's!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="maisie.c7.p20" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="maisie.c7.s44">Mrs. Wix broke into a queer laugh; it sounded to Maisie an unsuccessful imitation of a neigh.</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c7.s45"><qs/>"That's just what I'm here to make known--how perfectly the poor lady comes up to them herself."<qe/></s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c7.s46">She held up her head at the child.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c7.s47"><qs/>"You must take your mamma's message, Maisie, and you must feel that her wishing me to come to you with it this way is a great proof of interest and affection.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c7.s48">She sends you her particular love and announces to you that she's engaged to be married to Sir Claude."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="maisie.c7.p21" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="maisie.c7.s49"><qs/>"Sir Claude?"<qe/></s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c7.s50">Maisie wonderingly echoed.</s> <s sid="51" id="maisie.c7.s51">But while Mrs. Wix explained that this gentleman was a dear friend of Mrs. Farange's, who had been of great assistance to her in getting to Florence and in making herself comfortable there for the winter, she was not too violently shaken to perceive her old friend's enjoyment of the effect of this news on Miss Overmore.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c7.s52">That young lady opened her eyes very wide; she immediately remarked that Mrs. Farange's marriage would of course put an end to any further pretension to take her daughter back.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c7.s53">Mrs. Wix enquired with astonishment why it should do anything of the sort, and Miss Overmore gave as an instant reason that it was clearly but another dodge in a system of dodges.</s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c7.s54">She wanted to get out of the bargain: why else had she now left Maisie on her father's hands weeks and weeks beyond the time about which she had originally made such a fuss?</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c7.s55">It was vain for Mrs. Wix to represent--as she speciously proceeded to do--that all this time would be made up as soon as Mrs. Farange returned: she, Miss Overmore, knew nothing, thank heaven, about her confederate, but was very sure any person capable of forming that sort of relation with the lady in Florence would easily agree to object to the presence in his house of the fruit of a union that his dignity must ignore.</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c7.s56">It was a game like another, and Mrs. Wix's visit was clearly the first move in it.</s> <s sid="57" id="maisie.c7.s57">Maisie found in this exchange of asperities a fresh incitement to the unformulated fatalism in which her sense of her own career had long since taken refuge; and it was the beginning for her of a deeper prevision that, in spite of Miss Overmore's brilliancy and Mrs. Wix's passion, she should live to see a change in the nature of the struggle she appeared to have come into the world to produce.</s> <s sid="58" id="maisie.c7.s58">It would still be essentially a struggle, but its object would now be NOT to receive her.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="maisie.c7.p22" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="maisie.c7.s59">Mrs. Wix, after Miss Overmore's last demonstration, addressed herself wholly to the little girl, and, drawing from the pocket of her dingy old pelisse a small flat parcel, removed its envelope and wished to know if THAT looked like a gentleman who wouldn't be nice to everybody--let alone to a person he would be so sure to find so nice.</s> <s sid="60" id="maisie.c7.s60">Mrs. Farange, in the candour of new-found happiness, had enclosed a "cabinet" photograph of Sir Claude, and Maisie lost herself in admiration of the fair smooth face, the regular features, the kind eyes, the amiable air, the general glossiness and smartness of her prospective stepfather--only vaguely puzzled to suppose herself now with two fathers at once.</s> <s sid="61" id="maisie.c7.s61">Her researches had hitherto indicated that to incur a second parent of the same sex you had usually to lose the first.</s> <s sid="62" id="maisie.c7.s62"><qs/>"ISN'T he sympathetic?"<qe/> asked Mrs. Wix, who had clearly, on the strength of his charming portrait, made up her mind that Sir Claude promised her a future.</s> <s sid="63" id="maisie.c7.s63"><qs/>"You can see, I hope,"<qe/><sls/> she added with much expression, <sle/><qs/>"that HE'S a perfect gentleman!"<qe/></s> <s sid="64" id="maisie.c7.s64">Maisie had never before heard the word "sympathetic" applied to anybody's face; she heard it with pleasure and from that moment it agreeably remained with her.</s> <s sid="65" id="maisie.c7.s65">She testified moreover to the force of her own perception in a small soft sigh of response to the pleasant eyes that seemed to seek her acquaintance, to speak to her directly.</s> <s sid="66" id="maisie.c7.s66"><qs/>"He's quite lovely!"<qe/> she declared to Mrs. Wix.</s> <s sid="67" id="maisie.c7.s67">Then eagerly, irrepressibly, as she still held the photograph and Sir Claude continued to fraternise, <qs/>"Oh can't I keep it?"<qe/> she broke out.</s> <s sid="68" id="maisie.c7.s68">No sooner had she done so than she looked up from it at Miss Overmore: this was with the sudden instinct of appealing to the authority that had long ago impressed on her that she mustn't ask for things.</s> <s sid="69" id="maisie.c7.s69">Miss Overmore, to her surprise, looked distant and rather odd, hesitating and giving her time to turn again to Mrs. Wix.</s> <s sid="70" id="maisie.c7.s70">Then Maisie saw that lady's long face lengthen; it was stricken and almost scared, as if her young friend really expected more of her than she had to give.</s> <s sid="71" id="maisie.c7.s71">The photograph was a possession that, direly denuded, she clung to, and there was a momentary struggle between her fond clutch of it and her capability of every sacrifice for her precarious pupil.</s> <s sid="72" id="maisie.c7.s72">With the acuteness of her years, however, Maisie saw that her own avidity would triumph, and she held out the picture to Miss Overmore as if she were quite proud of her mother.</s> <s sid="73" id="maisie.c7.s73"><qs/>"Isn't he just lovely?"<qe/> she demanded while poor Mrs. Wix hungrily wavered, her straighteners largely covering it and her pelisse gathered about her with an intensity that strained its ancient seams.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="maisie.c7.p23" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="maisie.c7.s74"><qs/>"It was to ME, darling,"<qe/><sss/> the visitor said, <sse/><qs/>"that your mamma so generously sent it; but of course if it would give you particular pleasure--"<qe/> she faltered, only gasping her surrender.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="maisie.c7.p24" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="maisie.c7.s75">Miss Overmore continued extremely remote.</s> <s sid="76" id="maisie.c7.s76"><qs/>"If the photograph's your property, my dear, I shall be happy to oblige you by looking at it on some future occasion.</s> <s sid="77" id="maisie.c7.s77">But you must excuse me if I decline to touch an object belonging to Mrs. Wix."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="maisie.c7.p25" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="maisie.c7.s78">That lady had by this time grown very red.</s> <s sid="79" id="maisie.c7.s79"><qs/>"You might as well see him this way, miss,"<qe/><sss/> she retorted, <sse/><qs/>"as you certainly never will, I believe, in any other!</s> <s sid="80" id="maisie.c7.s80">Keep the pretty picture, by all means, my precious,"<qe/> she went on:</s> <s sid="81" id="maisie.c7.s81"><qs/>"Sir Claude will be happy himself, I dare say, to give me one with a kind inscription."<qe/></s> <s sid="82" id="maisie.c7.s82">The pathetic quaver of this brave boast was not lost on Maisie, who threw herself so gratefully on the speaker's neck that, when they had concluded their embrace, the public tenderness of which, she felt, made up for the sacrifice she imposed, their companion had had time to lay a quick hand on Sir Claude and, with a glance at him or not, whisk him effectually out of sight.</s> <s sid="83" id="maisie.c7.s83">Released from the child's arms Mrs. Wix looked about for the picture; then she fixed Miss Overmore with a hard dumb stare; and finally, with her eyes on the little girl again, achieved the grimmest of smiles.</s> <s sid="84" id="maisie.c7.s84"><qs/>"Well, nothing matters, Maisie, because there's another thing your mamma wrote about.</s> <s sid="85" id="maisie.c7.s85">She has made sure of me."<qe/></s> <s sid="86" id="maisie.c7.s86">Even after her loyal hug Maisie felt a bit of a sneak as she glanced at Miss Overmore for permission to understand this.</s> <s sid="87" id="maisie.c7.s87">But Mrs. Wix left them in no doubt of what it meant.</s> <s sid="88" id="maisie.c7.s88"><qs/>"She has definitely engaged me--for her return and for yours.</s> <s sid="89" id="maisie.c7.s89">Then you'll see for yourself."<qe/></s> <s sid="90" id="maisie.c7.s90">Maisie, on the spot, quite believed she should; but the prospect was suddenly thrown into confusion by an extraordinary demonstration from Miss Overmore.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="maisie.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="maisie.c7.s91"><qs/>"Mrs. Wix,"<qe/><sss/> said that young lady, <sse/><qs/>"has some undiscoverable reason for regarding your mother's hold on you as strengthened by the fact that she's about to marry.</s> <s sid="92" id="maisie.c7.s92">I wonder then--on that system--what our visitor will say to your father's."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="maisie.c7.p27" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="maisie.c7.s93">Miss Overmore's words were directed to her pupil, but her face, lighted with an irony that made it prettier even than ever before, was presented to the dingy figure that had stiffened itself for departure.</s> <s sid="94" id="maisie.c7.s94">The child's discipline had been bewildering--had ranged freely between the prescription that she was to answer when spoken to and the experience of lively penalties on obeying that prescription.</s> <s sid="95" id="maisie.c7.s95">This time, nevertheless, she felt emboldened for risks; above all as something portentous seemed to have leaped into her sense of the relations of things.</s> <s sid="96" id="maisie.c7.s96">She looked at Miss Overmore much as she had a way of looking at persons who treated her to "grown up" jokes.</s> <s sid="97" id="maisie.c7.s97"><qs/>"Do you mean papa's hold on me--do you mean HE'S about to marry?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="maisie.c7.p28" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="maisie.c7.s98"><qs/>"Papa's not about to marry--papa IS married, my dear.</s> <s sid="99" id="maisie.c7.s99">Papa was married the day before yesterday at Brighton."<qe/></s> <s sid="100" id="maisie.c7.s100">Miss Overmore glittered more gaily; meanwhile it came over Maisie, and quite dazzlingly, that her "smart" governess was a bride.</s> <s sid="101" id="maisie.c7.s101"><qs/>"He's my husband, if you please, and I'm his little wife.</s> <s sid="102" id="maisie.c7.s102">So NOW we'll see who's your little mother!"<qe/></s> <s sid="103" id="maisie.c7.s103">She caught her pupil to her bosom in a manner that was not to be outdone by the emissary of her predecessor, and a few moments later, when things had lurched back into their places, that poor lady, quite defeated of the last word, had soundlessly taken flight.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c9.s1">The idea of what she was to make up and the prodigious total it came to were kept well before Maisie at her mother's.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c9.s2">These things were the constant occupation of Mrs. Wix, who arrived there by the back stairs, but in tears of joy, the day after her own arrival.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c9.s3">The process of making up, as to which the good lady had an immense deal to say, took, through its successive phases, so long that it heralded a term at least equal to the child's last stretch with her father.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c9.s4">This, however, was a fuller and richer time: it bounded along to the tune of Mrs. Wix's constant insistence on the energy they must both put forth.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c9.s5">There was a fine intensity in the way the child agreed with her that under Mrs. Beale and Susan Ash she had learned nothing whatever; the wildness of the rescued castaway was one of the forces that would henceforth make for a career of conquest.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c9.s6">The year therefore rounded itself as a receptacle of retarded knowledge--a cup brimming over with the sense that now at least she was learning.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c9.s7">Mrs. Wix fed this sense from the stores of her conversation and with the immense bustle of her reminder that they must cull the fleeting hour.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c9.s8">They were surrounded with subjects they must take at a rush and perpetually getting into the attitude of triumphant attack.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c9.s9">They had certainly no idle hours, and the child went to bed each night as tired as from a long day's play.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c9.s10">This had begun from the moment of their reunion, begun with all Mrs. Wix had to tell her young friend of the reasons of her ladyship's extraordinary behaviour at the very first.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c9.p2" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="maisie.c9.s11">It took the form of her ladyship's refusal for three days to see her little girl--three days during which Sir Claude made hasty merry dashes into the schoolroom to smooth down the odd situation, to say <qs/>"She'll come round, you know; I assure you she'll come round,"<qe/> and a little even to compensate Maisie for the indignity he had caused her to suffer.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c9.s12">There had never in the child's life been, in all ways, such a delightful amount of reparation.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c9.s13">It came out by his sociable admission that her ladyship had not known of his visit to her late husband's house and of his having made that person's daughter a pretext for striking up an acquaintance with the dreadful creature installed there.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c9.s14">Heaven knew she wanted her child back and had made every plan of her own for removing her; what she couldn't for the present at least forgive any one concerned was such an officious underhand way of bringing about the transfer.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c9.s15">Maisie carried more of the weight of this resentment than even Mrs. Wix's confidential ingenuity could lighten for her, especially as Sir Claude himself was not at all ingenious, though indeed on the other hand he was not at all crushed.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c9.s16">He was amused and intermittent and at moments most startling; he impressed on his young companion, with a frankness that agitated her much more than he seemed to guess, that he depended on her not letting her mother, when she should see her, get anything out of her about anything Mrs. Beale might have said to him.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c9.s17">He came in and out; he professed, in joke, to take tremendous precautions; he showed a positive disposition to romp.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c9.s18">He chaffed Mrs. Wix till she was purple with the pleasure of it, and reminded Maisie of the reticence he expected of her till she set her teeth like an Indian captive.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c9.s19">Her lessons these first days and indeed for long after seemed to be all about Sir Claude, and yet she never really mentioned to Mrs. Wix that she was prepared, under his inspiring injunction, to be vainly tortured.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c9.s20">This lady, however, had formulated the position of things with an acuteness that showed how little she needed to be coached.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c9.s21">Her explanation of everything that seemed not quite pleasant--and if her own footing was perilous it met that danger as well--that her ladyship was passionately in love.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c9.s22">Maisie accepted this hint with infinite awe and pressed upon it much when she was at last summoned into the presence of her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c9.p3" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="maisie.c9.s23">There she encountered matters amid which it seemed really to help to give her a clue--an almost terrifying strangeness, full, none the less, after a little, of reverberations of Ida's old fierce and demonstrative recoveries of possession.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c9.s24">They had been some time in the house together, and this demonstration came late.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c9.s25">Preoccupied, however, as Maisie was with the idea of the sentiment Sir Claude had inspired, and familiar, in addition, by Mrs. Wix's anecdotes, with the ravages that in general such a sentiment could produce, she was able to make allowances for her ladyship's remarkable appearance, her violent splendour, the wonderful colour of her lips and even the hard stare, the stare of some gorgeous idol described in a story-book, that had come into her eyes in consequence of a curious thickening of their already rich circumference.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c9.s26">Her professions and explanations were mixed with eager challenges and sudden drops, in the midst of which Maisie recognised as a memory of other years the rattle of her trinkets and the scratch of her endearments, the odour of her clothes and the jumps of her conversation.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c9.s27">She had all her old clever way--Mrs. Wix said it was <qs/>"aristocratic"<qe/>--of changing the subject as she might have slammed the door in your face.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c9.s28">The principal thing that was different was the tint of her golden hair, which had changed to a coppery red and, with the head it profusely covered, struck the child as now lifted still further aloft.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c9.s29">This picturesque parent showed literally a grander stature and a nobler presence, things which, with some others that might have been bewildering, were handsomely accounted for by the romantic state of her affections.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c9.s30">It was her affections, Maisie could easily see, that led Ida to break out into questions as to what had passed at the other house between that horrible woman and Sir Claude; but it was also just here that the little girl was able to recall the effect with which in earlier days she had practised the pacific art of stupidity.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c9.s31">This art again came to her aid: her mother, in getting rid of her after an interview in which she had achieved a hollowness beyond her years, allowed her fully to understand she had not grown a bit more amusing.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c9.p4"><s sid="32" id="maisie.c9.s32">She could bear that; she could bear anything that helped her to feel she had done something for Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c9.s33">If she hadn't told Mrs. Wix how Mrs. Beale seemed to like him she certainly couldn't tell her ladyship.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c9.s34">In the way the past revived for her there was a queer confusion.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c9.s35">It was because mamma hated papa that she used to want to know bad things of him; but if at present she wanted to know the same of Sir Claude it was quite from the opposite motive.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c9.s36">She was awestruck at the manner in which a lady might be affected through the passion mentioned by Mrs. Wix; she held her breath with the sense of picking her steps among the tremendous things of life.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c9.s37">What she did, however, now, after the interview with her mother, impart to Mrs. Wix was that, in spite of her having had her "good" effect, as she called it--the effect she studied, the effect of harmless vacancy--her ladyship's last words had been that her ladyship's duty by her would be thoroughly done.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c9.s38">Over this announcement governess and pupil looked at each other in silent profundity; but as the weeks went by it had no consequences that interfered gravely with the breezy gallop of making up.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c9.s39">Her ladyship's duty took at times the form of not seeing her child for days together, and Maisie led her life in great prosperity between Mrs. Wix and kind Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c9.s40">Mrs. Wix had a new dress and, as she was the first to proclaim, a better position; so it all struck Maisie as a crowded brilliant life, with, for the time, Mrs. Beale and Susan Ash simply "left out" like children not invited to a Christmas party.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c9.s41">Mrs. Wix had a secret terror which, like most of her secret feelings, she discussed with her little companion, in great solemnity, by the hour: the possibility of her ladyship's coming down on them, in her sudden highbred way, with a school.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c9.s42">But she had also a balm to this fear in a conviction of the strength of Sir Claude's grasp of the situation.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c9.s43">He was too pleased--didn't he constantly say as much?--with the good impression made, in a wide circle, by Ida's sacrifices; and he came into the schoolroom repeatedly to let them know how beautifully he felt everything had gone off and everything would go on.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c9.p5" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="maisie.c9.s44">He disappeared at times for days, when his patient friends understood that her ladyship would naturally absorb him; but he always came back with the drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of society, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he thought of his home.</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c9.s45">Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation a sense that they almost themselves <qs/>"went out,"<qe/> he gave her a five-pound note and the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to Maisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat (which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games in boxes, with printed directions, and a bright red frame for the protection of his famous photograph.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c9.s46">The games were, as he said, to while away the evening hour; and the evening hour indeed often passed in futile attempts on Mrs. Wix's part to master what "it said" on the papers.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c9.s47">When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always replied <qs/>"Oh immensely!"<qe/> but they had earnest discussions as to whether they hadn't better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c9.s48">This was a course their delicacy shrank from; they couldn't have told exactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let him think they had trouble.</s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c9.s49">What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs. Wix, not only the five-pound note and the "not forgetting" her, but the perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her sounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together.</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c9.s50">He shook hands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than once, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the crowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm.</s> <s sid="51" id="maisie.c9.s51">When he met them in sunny Piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism that--needless for Mrs. Wix to sound THOSE words--her ladyship, though a blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c9.s52">Even to the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation at such humanities: it brought home to Maisie the way her humble companion had sidled and ducked through life.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c9.s53">But it settled the question of the degree to which Sir Claude was a gentleman: he was more of one than anybody else in the world--<qs/>"I don't care,"<qe/><sss/> Mrs. Wix repeatedly remarked, <sse/><qs/>"whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to whom you may be contracted in marriage."<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c9.s54">There were questions that Maisie never asked; so her governess was spared the embarrassment of telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa.</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c9.s55">This was not moreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between them at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going into, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it was further off than the turn of the page.</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c9.s56">The answer on the winter nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; and if the truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time the little girl's chief education.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c9.p6" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="maisie.c9.s57">It must also be admitted that he took them far, further perhaps than was always warranted by the old-fashioned conscience, the dingy decencies, of Maisie's simple instructress.</s> <s sid="58" id="maisie.c9.s58">There were hours when Mrs. Wix sighingly testified to the scruples she surmounted, seemed to ask what other line one COULD take with a young person whose experience had been, as it were, so peculiar.</s> <s sid="59" id="maisie.c9.s59"><qs/>"It isn't as if you didn't already know everything, is it, love?"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"I can't make you any worse than you ARE, can I, darling?"<qe/>--these were the terms in which the good lady justified to herself and her pupil her pleasant conversational ease.</s> <s sid="60" id="maisie.c9.s60">What the pupil already knew was indeed rather taken for granted than expressed, but it performed the useful function of transcending all textbooks and supplanting all studies.</s> <s sid="61" id="maisie.c9.s61">If the child couldn't be worse it was a comfort even to herself that she was bad--a comfort offering a broad firm support to the fundamental fact of the present crisis: the fact that mamma was fearfully jealous.</s> <s sid="62" id="maisie.c9.s62">This was another side of the circumstance of mamma's passion, and the deep couple in the schoolroom were not long in working round to it.</s> <s sid="63" id="maisie.c9.s63">It brought them face to face with the idea of the inconvenience suffered by any lady who marries a gentleman producing on other ladies the charming effect of Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="64" id="maisie.c9.s64">That such ladies wouldn't be able to help falling in love with him was a reflexion naturally irritating to his wife.</s> <s sid="65" id="maisie.c9.s65">One day when some accident, some crash of a banged door or some scurry of a scared maid, had rendered this truth particularly vivid, Maisie, receptive and profound, suddenly said to her companion:</s> <s sid="66" id="maisie.c9.s66"><qs/>"And you, my dear, are you in love with him too?"<qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="maisie.c9.s67">Even her profundity had left a margin for a laugh; so she was a trifle startled by the solemn promptitude with which Mrs. Wix plumped out:</s> <s sid="68" id="maisie.c9.s68"><qs/>"Over head and ears.</s> <s sid="69" id="maisie.c9.s69">I've NEVER since you ask me, been so far gone."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c9.p7" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="maisie.c9.s70">This boldness had none the less no effect of deterrence for her when, a few days later--it was because several had elapsed without a visit from Sir Claude--her governess turned the tables.</s> <s sid="71" id="maisie.c9.s71"><qs/>"May I ask you, miss, if YOU are?"<qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="maisie.c9.s72">Mrs. Wix brought it out, she could see, with hesitation, but clearly intending a joke.</s> <s sid="73" id="maisie.c9.s73"><qs/>"Why RATHER!"<qe/> the child made answer, as if in surprise at not having long ago seemed sufficiently to commit herself; on which her friend gave a sigh of apparent satisfaction.</s> <s sid="74" id="maisie.c9.s74">It might in fact have expressed positive relief.</s> <s sid="75" id="maisie.c9.s75">Everything was as it should be.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="maisie.c9.p8" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="maisie.c9.s76">Yet it was not with them, they were very sure, that her ladyship was furious, nor because she had forbidden it that there befell at last a period--six months brought it round--when for days together he scarcely came near them.</s> <s sid="77" id="maisie.c9.s77">He was <qs/>"off,"<qe/><sss/> and Ida was <sse/><qs/>"off,"<qe/> and they were sometimes off together and sometimes apart; there were seasons when the simple students had the house to themselves, when the very servants seemed also to be "off" and dinner became a reckless forage in pantries and sideboards.</s> <s sid="78" id="maisie.c9.s78">Mrs. Wix reminded her disciple on such occasions--hungry moments often, when all the support of the reminder was required--that the "real life" of their companions, the brilliant society in which it was inevitable they should move and the complicated pleasures in which it was almost presumptuous of the mind to follow them, must offer features literally not to be imagined without being seen.</s> <s sid="79" id="maisie.c9.s79">At one of these times Maisie found her opening it out that, though the difficulties were many, it was Mrs. Beale who had now become the chief.</s> <s sid="80" id="maisie.c9.s80">Then somehow it was brought fully to the child's knowledge that her stepmother had been making attempts to see her, that her mother had deeply resented it, that her stepfather had backed her stepmother up, that the latter had pretended to be acting as the representative of her father, and that her mother took the whole thing, in plain terms, very hard.</s> <s sid="81" id="maisie.c9.s81">The situation was, as Mrs. Wix declared, an extraordinary muddle to be sure.</s> <s sid="82" id="maisie.c9.s82">Her account of it brought back to Maisie the happy vision of the way Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale had made acquaintance--an incident to which, with her stepfather, though she had had little to say about it to Mrs. Wix, she had during the first weeks of her stay at her mother's found more than one opportunity to revert.</s> <s sid="83" id="maisie.c9.s83">As to what had taken place the day Sir Claude came for her, she had been vaguely grateful to Mrs. Wix for not attempting, as her mother had attempted, to put her through.</s> <s sid="84" id="maisie.c9.s84">That was what Sir Claude had called the process when he warned her of it, and again afterwards when he told her she was an awfully good "chap" for having foiled it.</s> <s sid="85" id="maisie.c9.s85">Then it was that, well aware Mrs. Beale hadn't in the least really given her up, she had asked him if he remained in communication with her and if for the time everything must really be held to be at an end between her stepmother and herself.</s> <s sid="86" id="maisie.c9.s86">This conversation had occurred in consequence of his one day popping into the schoolroom and finding Maisie alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c10.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="maisie.c10.s14">The child turned it over.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c10.s15"><qs/>"Oh I'm not every bit Mrs. Beale has!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c10.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="maisie.c10.s16">Sir Claude seemed much amused at this.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c10.s17"><qs/>"No; you're not every bit she has!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c10.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="maisie.c10.s18">He laughed for some moments, but that was an old story to Maisie, who was not too much disconcerted to go on:</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c10.s19"><qs/>"But she'll never give me up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c10.p7" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="maisie.c10.s20"><qs/>"Well, I won't either, old boy: so that's not so wonderful, and she's not the only one.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c10.s21">But if she's so fond of you, why doesn't she write to you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="maisie.c10.p14" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="maisie.c10.s36">Maisie remembered how little she had done so; but she desired to protect Mrs. Beale too.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c10.s37">The only protection she could think of, however, was the plea:</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c10.s38"><qs/>"Oh at papa's, you know, they don't mind!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="maisie.c10.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="maisie.c10.s39">At this Sir Claude only smiled.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c10.s40"><qs/>"No, I dare say not.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c10.s41">But here we mind, don't we?--we take care what we say.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c10.s42">I don't suppose it's a matter on which I ought to prejudice you,"<qe/><sss/> he went on; <sse/><qs/>"but I think we must on the whole be rather nicer here than at your father's.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c10.s43">However, I don't press that; for it's the sort of question on which it's awfully awkward for you to speak.</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c10.s44">Don't worry, at any rate:</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c10.s45">I assure you I'll back you up."<qe/></s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c10.s46">Then after a moment and while he smoked he reverted to Mrs. Beale and the child's first enquiry.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c10.s47"><qs/>"I'm afraid we can't do much for her just now.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c10.s48">I haven't seen her since that day--upon my word I haven't seen her."<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c10.s49">The next instant, with a laugh the least bit foolish, the young man slightly coloured: he must have felt this profession of innocence to be excessive as addressed to Maisie.</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c10.s50">It was inevitable to say to her, however, that of course her mother loathed the lady of the other house.</s> <s sid="51" id="maisie.c10.s51">He couldn't go there again with his wife's consent, and he wasn't the man--he begged her to believe, falling once more, in spite of himself, into the scruple of showing the child he didn't trip--to go there without it.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c10.s52">He was liable in talking with her to take the tone of her being also a man of the world.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c10.s53">He had gone to Mrs. Beale's to fetch away Maisie, but that was altogether different.</s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c10.s54">Now that she was in her mother's house what pretext had he to give her mother for paying calls on her father's wife?</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c10.s55">And of course Mrs. Beale couldn't come to Ida's--Ida would tear her limb from limb.</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c10.s56">Maisie, with this talk of pretexts, remembered how much Mrs. Beale had made of her being a good one, and how, for such a function, it was her fate to be either much depended on or much missed.</s> <s sid="57" id="maisie.c10.s57">Sir Claude moreover recognised on this occasion that perhaps things would take a turn later on; and he wound up by saying:</s> <s sid="58" id="maisie.c10.s58"><qs/>"I'm sure she does sincerely care for you--how can she possibly help it?</s> <s sid="59" id="maisie.c10.s59">She's very young and very pretty and very clever:</s> <s sid="60" id="maisie.c10.s60">I think she's charming.</s> <s sid="61" id="maisie.c10.s61">But we must walk very straight.</s> <s sid="62" id="maisie.c10.s62">If you'll help me, you know, I'll help YOU,"<qe/> he concluded in the pleasant fraternising, equalising, not a bit patronising way which made the child ready to go through anything for him and the beauty of which, as she dimly felt, was that it was so much less a deceitful descent to her years than a real indifference to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="maisie.c10.p16" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="maisie.c10.s63">It gave her moments of secret rapture--moments of believing she might help him indeed.</s> <s sid="64" id="maisie.c10.s64">The only mystification in this was the imposing time of life that her elders spoke of as youth.</s> <s sid="65" id="maisie.c10.s65">For Sir Claude then Mrs. Beale was <qs/>"young,"<qe/> just as for Mrs. Wix Sir Claude was: that was one of the merits for which Mrs. Wix most commended him.</s> <s sid="66" id="maisie.c10.s66">What therefore was Maisie herself, and, in another relation to the matter, what therefore was mamma?</s> <s sid="67" id="maisie.c10.s67">It took her some time to puzzle out with the aid of an experiment or two that it wouldn't do to talk about mamma's youth.</s> <s sid="68" id="maisie.c10.s68">She even went so far one day, in the presence of that lady's thick colour and marked lines, as to wonder if it would occur to any one but herself to do so.</s> <s sid="69" id="maisie.c10.s69">Yet if she wasn't young then she was old; and this threw an odd light on her having a husband of a different generation.</s> <s sid="70" id="maisie.c10.s70">Mr. Farange was still older--that Maisie perfectly knew; and it brought her in due course to the perception of how much more, since Mrs. Beale was younger than Sir Claude, papa must be older than Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="71" id="maisie.c10.s71">Such discoveries were disconcerting and even a trifle confounding: these persons, it appeared, were not of the age they ought to be.</s> <s sid="72" id="maisie.c10.s72">This was somehow particularly the case with mamma, and the fact made her reflect with some relief on her not having gone with Mrs. Wix into the question of Sir Claude's attachment to his wife.</s> <s sid="73" id="maisie.c10.s73">She was conscious that in confining their attention to the state of her ladyship's own affections they had been controlled--Mrs. Wix perhaps in especial--by delicacy and even by embarrassment.</s> <s sid="74" id="maisie.c10.s74">The end of her colloquy with her stepfather in the schoolroom was her saying:</s> <s sid="75" id="maisie.c10.s75"><qs/>"Then if we're not to see Mrs. Beale at all it isn't what she seemed to think when you came for me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="maisie.c10.p17" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="maisie.c10.s76">He looked rather blank.</s> <s sid="77" id="maisie.c10.s77"><qs/>"What did she seem to think?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="maisie.c10.p18" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="maisie.c10.s78"><qs/>"Why that I've brought you together."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="maisie.c10.p19" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="maisie.c10.s79"><qs/>"She thought that?"<qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="maisie.c10.s80">Sir Claude asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="maisie.c10.p20" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="maisie.c10.s81">Maisie was surprised at his already forgetting it.</s> <s sid="82" id="maisie.c10.s82"><qs/>"Just as I had brought papa and her.</s> <s sid="83" id="maisie.c10.s83">Don't you remember she said so?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="maisie.c10.p21" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="maisie.c10.s84">It came back to Sir Claude in a peal of laughter.</s> <s sid="85" id="maisie.c10.s85"><qs/>"Oh yes--she said so!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="maisie.c10.p22" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="maisie.c10.s86"><qs/>"And YOU said so,"<qe/> Maisie lucidly pursued.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="maisie.c10.p23" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="maisie.c10.s87">He recovered, with increasing mirth, the whole occasion.</s> <s sid="88" id="maisie.c10.s88"><qs/>"And YOU said so!"<qe/> he retorted as if they were playing a game.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="maisie.c10.p24" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="maisie.c10.s89"><qs/>"Then were we all mistaken?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="maisie.c10.p25" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="maisie.c10.s90">He considered a little.</s> <s sid="91" id="maisie.c10.s91"><qs/>"No, on the whole not.</s> <s sid="92" id="maisie.c10.s92">I dare say it's just what you HAVE done.</s> <s sid="93" id="maisie.c10.s93">We ARE together--it's really most odd.</s> <s sid="94" id="maisie.c10.s94">She's thinking of us--of you and me--though we don't meet.</s> <s sid="95" id="maisie.c10.s95">And I've no doubt you'll find it will be all right when you go back to her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="maisie.c10.p26" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="maisie.c10.s96"><qs/>"Am I going back to her?"<qe/></s> <s sid="97" id="maisie.c10.s97">Maisie brought out with a little gasp which was like a sudden clutch of the happy present.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="maisie.c10.p27" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="maisie.c10.s98">It appeared to make Sir Claude grave a moment; it might have made him feel the weight of the pledge his action had given.</s> <s sid="99" id="maisie.c10.s99"><qs/>"Oh some day, I suppose!</s> <s sid="100" id="maisie.c10.s100">We've plenty of time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="maisie.c10.p28" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="maisie.c10.s101"><qs/>"I've such a tremendous lot to make up,"<qe/> Maisie said with a sense of great boldness.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="maisie.c10.p30" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="maisie.c10.s104">This was encouraging; and to show cheerfully that she was reassured she replied:</s> <s sid="105" id="maisie.c10.s105"><qs/>"That's what Mrs. Wix sees too."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c11.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c11.s1">It must not be supposed that her ladyship's intermissions were not qualified by demonstrations of another order--triumphal entries and breathless pauses during which she seemed to take of everything in the room, from the state of the ceiling to that of her daughter's boot-toes, a survey that was rich in intentions.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c11.s2">Sometimes she sat down and sometimes she surged about, but her attitude wore equally in either case the grand air of the practical.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c11.s3">She found so much to deplore that she left a great deal to expect, and bristled so with calculation that she seemed to scatter remedies and pledges.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c11.s4">Her visits were as good as an outfit; her manner, as Mrs. Wix once said, as good as a pair of curtains; but she was a person addicted to extremes--sometimes barely speaking to her child and sometimes pressing this tender shoot to a bosom cut, as Mrs. Wix had also observed, remarkably low.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c11.s5">She was always in a fearful hurry, and the lower the bosom was cut the more it was to be gathered she was wanted elsewhere.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c11.s6">She usually broke in alone, but sometimes Sir Claude was with her, and during all the earlier period there was nothing on which these appearances had had so delightful a bearing as on the way her ladyship was, as Mrs. Wix expressed it, under the spell.</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c11.s7"><qs/>"But ISN'T she under it!"<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c11.s8">Maisie used in thoughtful but familiar reference to exclaim after Sir Claude had swept mamma away in peals of natural laughter.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c11.s9">Not even in the old days of the convulsed ladies had she heard mamma laugh so freely as in these moments of conjugal surrender, to the gaiety of which even a little girl could see she had at last a right--a little girl whose thoughtfulness was now all happy selfish meditation on good omens and future fun.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c11.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="maisie.c11.s10">Unaccompanied, in subsequent hours, and with an effect of changing to meet a change, Ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and abrupt--the tone of having, at an immense cost, made over everything to Sir Claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasn't right it was because Sir Claude was so dreadfully vague.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c11.s11"><qs/>"He has made from the first such a row about you,"<qe/><sls/> she said on one occasion to Maisie, <sle/><qs/>"that I've told him to do for you himself and try how he likes it--see?</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c11.s12">I've washed my hands of you; I've made you over to him; and if you're discontented it's on him, please, you'll come down.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c11.s13">So don't haul poor ME up--I assure you I've worries enough."<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c11.s14">One of these, visibly, was that the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger of breaking; another was that she was finally forced to make no secret of her husband's unfitness for real responsibilities.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c11.s15">The day came indeed when her breathless auditors learnt from her in bewilderment that what ailed him was that he was, alas, simply not serious.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c11.s16">Maisie wept on Mrs. Wix's bosom after hearing that Sir Claude was a butterfly; considering moreover that her governess but half-patched it up in coming out at various moments the next few days with the opinion that it was proper to his "station" to be careless and free.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c11.s17">That had been proper to every one's station that she had yet encountered save poor Mrs. Wix's own, and the particular merit of Sir Claude had seemed precisely that he was different from every one.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c11.s18">She talked with him, however, as time went on, very freely about her mother; being with him, in this relation, wholly without the fear that had kept her silent before her father--the fear of bearing tales and making bad things worse.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c11.s19">He appeared to accept the idea that he had taken her over and made her, as he said, his particular lark; he quite agreed also that he was an awful fraud and an idle beast and a sorry dunce.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c11.s20">And he never said a word to her against her mother--he only remained dumb and discouraged in the face of her ladyship's own overtopping earnestness.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c11.s21">There were occasions when he even spoke as if he had wrenched his little charge from the arms of a parent who had fought for her tooth and nail.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c11.p3" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="maisie.c11.s22">This was the very moral of a scene that flashed into vividness one day when the four happened to meet without company in the drawing-room and Maisie found herself clutched to her mother's breast and passionately sobbed and shrieked over, made the subject of a demonstration evidently sequent to some sharp passage just enacted.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c11.s23">The connexion required that while she almost cradled the child in her arms Ida should speak of her as hideously, as fatally estranged, and should rail at Sir Claude as the cruel author of the outrage.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c11.s24"><qs/>"He has taken you FROM me,"<qe/><sss/> she cried; <sse/><qs/>"he has set you AGAINST me, and you've been won away and your horrid little mind has been poisoned!</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c11.s25">You've gone over to him, you've given yourself up to side against me and hate me.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c11.s26">You never open your mouth to me--you know you don't; and you chatter to him like a dozen magpies.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c11.s27">Don't lie about it--I hear you all over the place.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c11.s28">You hang about him in a way that's barely decent--he can do what he likes with you.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c11.s29">Well then, let him, to his heart's content: he has been in such a hurry to take you that we'll see if it suits him to keep you.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c11.s30">I'm very good to break my heart about it when you've no more feeling for me than a clammy little fish!"<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c11.s31">She suddenly thrust the child away and, as a disgusted admission of failure, sent her flying across the room into the arms of Mrs. Wix, whom at this moment and even in the whirl of her transit Maisie saw, very red, exchange a quick queer look with Sir Claude.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c11.p4" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="maisie.c11.s32">The impression of the look remained with her, confronting her with such a critical little view of her mother's explosion that she felt the less ashamed of herself for incurring the reproach with which she had been cast off.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c11.s33">Her father had once called her a heartless little beast, and now, though decidedly scared, she was as stiff and cold as if the description had been just.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c11.s34">She was not even frightened enough to cry, which would have been a tribute to her mother's wrongs: she was only, more than anything else, curious about the opinion mutely expressed by their companions.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c11.s35">Taking the earliest opportunity to question Mrs. Wix on this subject she elicited the remarkable reply:</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c11.s36"><qs/>"Well, my dear, it's her ladyship's game, and we must just hold on like grim death."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c11.p5"><s sid="37" id="maisie.c11.s37">Maisie could interpret at her leisure these ominous words.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c11.s38">Her reflexions indeed at this moment thickened apace, and one of them made her sure that her governess had conversations, private, earnest and not infrequent, with her denounced stepfather.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c11.s39">She perceived in the light of a second episode that something beyond her knowledge had taken place in the house.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c11.s40">The things beyond her knowledge--numerous enough in truth--had not hitherto, she believed, been the things that had been nearest to her: she had even had in the past a small smug conviction that in the domestic labyrinth she always kept the clue.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c11.s41">This time too, however, she at last found out--with the discreet aid, it had to be confessed, of Mrs. Wix.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c11.s42">Sir Claude's own assistance was abruptly taken from her, for his comment on her ladyship's game was to start on the spot, quite alone, for Paris, evidently because he wished to show a spirit when accused of bad behaviour.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c11.s43">He might be fond of his stepdaughter, Maisie felt, without wishing her to be after all thrust on him in such a way; his absence therefore, it was clear, was a protest against the thrusting.</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c11.s44">It was while this absence lasted that our young lady finally discovered what had happened in the house to be that her mother was no longer in love.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c11.p6"><s sid="45" id="maisie.c11.s45">The limit of a passion for Sir Claude had certainly been reached, she judged, some time before the day on which her ladyship burst suddenly into the schoolroom to introduce Mr. Perriam, who, as she announced from the doorway to Maisie, wouldn't believe his ears that one had a great hoyden of a daughter.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c11.s46">Mr. Perriam was short and massive--Mrs. Wix remarked afterwards that he was "too fat for the pace"; and it would have been difficult to say of him whether his head were more bald or his black moustache more bushy.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c11.s47">He seemed also to have moustaches over his eyes, which, however, by no means prevented these polished little globes from rolling round the room as if they had been billiard-balls impelled by Ida's celebrated stroke.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c11.s48">Mr. Perriam wore on the hand that pulled his moustache a diamond of dazzling lustre, in consequence of which and of his general weight and mystery our young lady observed on his departure that if he had only had a turban he would have been quite her idea of a heathen Turk.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c11.p7" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="maisie.c11.s49"><qs/>"He's quite my idea,"<qe/><sss/> Mrs. Wix replied, <sse/><qs/>"of a heathen Jew."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="maisie.c11.p10" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="maisie.c11.s55"><qs/>"On the death of his papa?"<qe/> the child interestedly enquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="maisie.c11.p14" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="maisie.c11.s62"><qs/>"A hundred?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="maisie.c11.p15" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="maisie.c11.s63">Mrs. Wix was not sure of the number, but there were enough of them to have seemed to warm up for the time the penury of the schoolroom--to linger there as an afterglow of the hot heavy light Mr. Perriam sensibly shed.</s> <s sid="64" id="maisie.c11.s64">This was also, no doubt, on his part, an effect of that enjoyment of life with which, among her elders, Maisie had been in contact from her earliest years--the sign of happy maturity, the old familiar note of overflowing cheer.</s> <s sid="65" id="maisie.c11.s65"><qs/>"How d'ye do, ma'am?</s> <s sid="66" id="maisie.c11.s66">How d'ye do, little miss?"<qe/>--he laughed and nodded at the gaping figures.</s> <s sid="67" id="maisie.c11.s67"><qs/>"She has brought me up for a peep--it's true I wouldn't take you on trust.</s> <s sid="68" id="maisie.c11.s68">She's always talking about you, but she'd never produce you; so to-day I challenged her on the spot.</s> <s sid="69" id="maisie.c11.s69">Well, you ain't a myth, my dear--I back down on that,"<qe/><sls/> the visitor went on to Maisie; <sle/><qs/>"nor you either, miss, though you might be, to be sure!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="maisie.c11.p16" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="maisie.c11.s70"><qs/>"I bored him with you, darling--I bore every one,"<qe/><sss/> Ida said, <sse/><qs/>"and to prove that you ARE a sweet thing, as well as a fearfully old one, I told him he could judge for himself.</s> <s sid="71" id="maisie.c11.s71">So now he sees that you're a dreadful bouncing business and that your poor old Mummy's at least sixty!"<qe/><sls/>--and her ladyship smiled at Mr. Perriam with the charm that her daughter had heard imputed to her at papa's by the merry gentlemen who had so often wished to get from him what they called a <sle/><qs/>"rise."<qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="maisie.c11.s72">Her manner at that instant gave the child a glimpse more vivid than any yet enjoyed of the attraction that papa, in remarkable language, always denied she could put forth.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="maisie.c11.p17" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="maisie.c11.s73">Mr. Perriam, however, clearly recognised it in the humour with which he met her.</s> <s sid="74" id="maisie.c11.s74"><qs/>"I never said you ain't wonderful--did I ever say it, hey?"<qe/> and he appealed with pleasant confidence to the testimony of the schoolroom, about which itself also he evidently felt something might be expected of him.</s> <s sid="75" id="maisie.c11.s75"><qs/>"So this is their little place, hey?</s> <s sid="76" id="maisie.c11.s76">Charming, charming, charming!"<qe/> he repeated as he vaguely looked round.</s> <s sid="77" id="maisie.c11.s77">The interrupted students clung together as if they had been personally exposed; but Ida relieved their embarrassment by a hunch of her high shoulders.</s> <s sid="78" id="maisie.c11.s78">This time the smile she addressed to Mr. Perriam had a beauty of sudden sadness.</s> <s sid="79" id="maisie.c11.s79"><qs/>"What on earth is a poor woman to do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="maisie.c11.p18" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="maisie.c11.s80">The visitor's grimace grew more marked as he continued to look, and the conscious little schoolroom felt still more like a cage at a menagerie.</s> <s sid="81" id="maisie.c11.s81"><qs/>"Charming, charming, charming!"<qe/></s> <s sid="82" id="maisie.c11.s82">Mr. Perriam insisted; but the parenthesis closed with a prompt click.</s> <s sid="83" id="maisie.c11.s83"><qs/>"There you are!"<qe/> said her ladyship.</s> <s sid="84" id="maisie.c11.s84"><qs/>"By-bye!"<qe/> she sharply added.</s> <s sid="85" id="maisie.c11.s85">The next minute they were on the stairs, and Mrs. Wix and her companion, at the open door and looking mutely at each other, were reached by the sound of the large social current that carried them back to their life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c17.p2"><s sid="14" id="maisie.c17.s14">How and when and where, however, were just what Maisie was not to know--an exclusion moreover that she never questioned in the light of a participation large enough to make him, while she shared the ample void of Mrs. Beale's rather blank independence, shine in her yearning eye like the single, the sovereign window-square of a great dim disproportioned room.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c17.s15">As far as her father was concerned such hours had no interruption; and then it was clear between them that each was thinking of the absent and thinking the other thought, so that he was an object of conscious reference in everything they said or did.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c17.s16">The wretched truth, Mrs. Beale had to confess, was that she had hoped against hope and that in the Regent's Park it was impossible Sir Claude should really be in and out.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c17.s17">Hadn't they at last to look the fact in the face?--it was too disgustingly evident that no one after all had been squared.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c17.s18">Well, if no one had been squared it was because every one had been vile.</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c17.s19">No one and every one were of course Beale and Ida, the extent of whose power to be nasty was a thing that, to a little girl, Mrs. Beale simply couldn't give chapter and verse for.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c17.s20">Therefore it was that to keep going at all, as she said, that lady had to make, as she also said, another arrangement--the arrangement in which Maisie was included only to the point of knowing it existed and wondering wistfully what it was.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c17.s21">Conspicuously at any rate it had a side that was responsible for Mrs. Beale's sudden emotion and sudden confidence--a demonstration this, however, of which the tearfulness was far from deterrent to our heroine's thought of how happy she should be if she could only make an arrangement for herself.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c17.s22">Mrs. Beale's own operated, it appeared, with regularity and frequency; for it was almost every day or two that she was able to bring Maisie a message and to take one back.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c17.s23">It had been over the vision of what, as she called it, he did for her that she broke down; and this vision was kept in a manner before Maisie by a subsequent increase not only of the gaiety, but literally--it seemed not presumptuous to perceive--of the actual virtue of her friend.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c17.s24">The friend was herself the first to proclaim it: he had pulled her up immensely--he had quite pulled her round.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c17.s25">She had charming tormenting words about him: he was her good fairy, her hidden spring--above all he was just her "higher" conscience.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c17.s26">That was what had particularly come out with her startling tears: he had made her, dear man, think ever so much better of herself.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c17.s27">It had been thus rather surprisingly revealed that she had been in a way to think ill, and Maisie was glad to hear of the corrective at the same time that she heard of the ailment.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c17.p3" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="maisie.c17.s28">She presently found herself supposing, and in spite of her envy even hoping, that whenever Mrs. Beale was out of the house Sir Claude had in some manner the satisfaction of it.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c17.s29">This was now of more frequent occurrence than ever before--so much so that she would have thought of her stepmother as almost extravagantly absent had it not been that, in the first place, her father was a superior specimen of that habit: it was the frequent remark of his present wife, as it had been, before the tribunals of their country, a prominent plea of her predecessor, that he scarce came home even to sleep.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c17.s30">In the second place Mrs. Beale, when she WAS on the spot, had now a beautiful air of longing to make up for everything.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c17.s31">The only shadow in such bright intervals was that, as Maisie put it to herself, she could get nothing by questions.</s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c17.s32">It was in the nature of things to be none of a small child's business, even when a small child had from the first been deluded into a fear that she might be only too much initiated.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c17.s33">Things then were in Maisie's experience so true to their nature that questions were almost always improper; but she learned on the other hand soon to recognise how at last, sometimes, patient little silences and intelligent little looks could be rewarded by delightful little glimpses.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c17.s34">There had been years at Beale Farange's when the monosyllable "he" meant always, meant almost violently, the master; but all that was changed at a period at which Sir Claude's merits were of themselves so much in the air that it scarce took even two letters to name him.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c17.s35"><qs/>"He keeps me up splendidly--he does, my own precious,"<qe/> Mrs. Beale would observe to her comrade; or else she would say that the situation at the other establishment had reached a point that could scarcely be believed--the point, monstrous as it sounded, of his not having laid eyes upon her for twelve days.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c17.s36">"She" of course at Beale Farange's had never meant any one but Ida, and there was the difference in this case that it now meant Ida with renewed intensity.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c17.s37">Mrs. Beale--it was striking--was in a position to animadvert more and more upon her dreadfulness, the moral of all which appeared to be how abominably yet blessedly little she had to do with her husband.</s> <s sid="38" id="maisie.c17.s38">This flow of information came home to our two friends because, truly, Mrs. Beale had not much more to do with her own; but that was one of the reflexions that Maisie could make without allowing it to break the spell of her present sympathy.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c17.s39">How could such a spell be anything but deep when Sir Claude's influence, operating from afar, at last really determined the resumption of his stepdaughter's studies?</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c17.s40">Mrs. Beale again took fire about them and was quite vivid for Maisie as to their being the great matter to which the dear absent one kept her up.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c17.p4" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="maisie.c17.s41">This was the second source--I have just alluded to the first--of the child's consciousness of something that, very hopefully, she described to herself as a new phase; and it also presented in the brightest light the fresh enthusiasm with which Mrs. Beale always reappeared and which really gave Maisie a happier sense than she had yet had of being very dear at least to two persons.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c17.s42">That she had small remembrance at present of a third illustrates, I am afraid, a temporary oblivion of Mrs. Wix, an accident to be explained only by a state of unnatural excitement.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c17.s43">For what was the form taken by Mrs. Beale's enthusiasm and acquiring relief in the domestic conditions still left to her but the delightful form of "reading" with her little charge on lines directly prescribed and in works profusely supplied by Sir Claude?</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c17.s44">He had got hold of an awfully good list--<qs/>"mostly essays, don't you know?"<qe/></s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c17.s45">Mrs. Beale had said; a word always august to Maisie, but henceforth to be softened by hazy, in fact by quite languorous edges.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c17.s46">There was at any rate a week in which no less than nine volumes arrived, and the impression was to be gathered from Mrs. Beale that the obscure intercourse she enjoyed with Sir Claude not only involved an account and a criticism of studies, but was organised almost for the very purpose of report and consultation.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c17.s47">It was for Maisie's education in short that, as she often repeated, she closed her door--closed it to the gentlemen who used to flock there in such numbers and whom her husband's practical desertion of her would have made it a course of the highest indelicacy to receive.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c17.s48">Maisie was familiar from of old with the principle at least of the care that a woman, as Mrs. Beale phrased it, attractive and exposed must take of her <qs/>"character,"<qe/> and was duly impressed with the rigour of her stepmother's scruples.</s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c17.s49">There was literally no one of the other sex whom she seemed to feel at liberty to see at home, and when the child risked an enquiry about the ladies who, one by one, during her own previous period, had been made quite loudly welcome, Mrs. Beale hastened to inform her that, one by one, they had, the fiends, been found out, after all, to be awful.</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c17.s50">If she wished to know more about them she was recommended to approach her father.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c17.p5" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="maisie.c17.s51">Maisie had, however, at the very moment of this injunction much livelier curiosities, for the dream of lectures at an institution had at last become a reality, thanks to Sir Claude's now unbounded energy in discovering what could be done.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c17.s52">It stood out in this connexion that when you came to look into things in a spirit of earnestness an immense deal could be done for very little more than your fare in the Underground.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c17.s53">The institution--there was a splendid one in a part of the town but little known to the child--became, in the glow of such a spirit, a thrilling place, and the walk to it from the station through Glower Street (a pronunciation for which Mrs. Beale once laughed at her little friend) a pathway literally strewn with <qs/>"subjects."<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="maisie.c17.s54">Maisie imagined herself to pluck them as she went, though they thickened in the great grey rooms where the fountain of knowledge, in the form usually of a high voice that she took at first to be angry, plashed in the stillness of rows of faces thrust out like empty jugs.</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c17.s55"><qs/>"It MUST do us good--it's all so hideous,"<qe/> Mrs. Beale had immediately declared; manifesting a purity of resolution that made these occasions quite the most harmonious of all the many on which the pair had pulled together.</s> <s sid="56" id="maisie.c17.s56">Maisie certainly had never, in such an association, felt so uplifted, and never above all been so carried off her feet, as at the moments of Mrs. Beale's breathlessly re-entering the house and fairly shrieking upstairs to know if they should still be in time for a lecture.</s> <s sid="57" id="maisie.c17.s57">Her stepdaughter, all ready from the earliest hours, almost leaped over the banister to respond, and they dashed out together in quest of learning as hard as they often dashed back to release Mrs. Beale for other preoccupations.</s> <s sid="58" id="maisie.c17.s58">There had been in short no bustle like these particular spasms, once they had broken out, since that last brief flurry when Mrs. Wix, blowing as if she were grooming her, "made up" for everything previously lost at her father's.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c17.p6" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="maisie.c17.s59">These weeks as well were too few, but they were flooded with a new emotion, part of which indeed came from the possibility that, through the long telescope of Glower Street, or perhaps between the pillars of the institution--which impressive objects were what Maisie thought most made it one--they should some day spy Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="60" id="maisie.c17.s60">That was what Mrs. Beale, under pressure, had said--doubtless a little impatiently:</s> <s sid="61" id="maisie.c17.s61"><qs/>"Oh yes, oh yes, some day!"<qe/></s> <s sid="62" id="maisie.c17.s62">His joining them was clearly far less of a matter of course than was to have been gathered from his original profession of desire to improve in their company his own mind; and this sharpened our young lady's guess that since that occasion either something destructive had happened or something desirable hadn't.</s> <s sid="63" id="maisie.c17.s63">Mrs. Beale had thrown but a partial light in telling her how it had turned out that nobody had been squared.</s> <s sid="64" id="maisie.c17.s64">Maisie wished at any rate that somebody WOULD be squared.</s> <s sid="65" id="maisie.c17.s65">However, though in every approach to the temple of knowledge she watched in vain for Sir Claude, there was no doubt about the action of his loved image as an incentive and a recompense.</s> <s sid="66" id="maisie.c17.s66">When the institution was most on pillars--or, as Mrs. Beale put it, on stilts--when the subject was deepest and the lecture longest and the listeners ugliest, then it was they both felt their patron in the background would be most pleased with them.</s> <s sid="67" id="maisie.c17.s67">One day, abruptly, with a glance at this background, Mrs. Beale said to her companion:</s> <s sid="68" id="maisie.c17.s68">"We'll go to-night to the thingumbob at Earl's Court"; an announcement putting forth its full lustre when she had made known that she referred to the great Exhibition just opened in that quarter, a collection of extraordinary foreign things in tremendous gardens, with illuminations, bands, elephants, switchbacks and side-shows, as well as crowds of people among whom they might possibly see some one they knew.</s> <s sid="69" id="maisie.c17.s69">Maisie flew in the same bound at the neck of her friend and at the name of Sir Claude, on which Mrs. Beale confessed that--well, yes, there was just a chance that he would be able to meet them.</s> <s sid="70" id="maisie.c17.s70">He never of course, in his terrible position, knew what might happen from hour to hour; but he hoped to be free and he had given Mrs. Beale the tip.</s> <s sid="71" id="maisie.c17.s71"><qs/>"Bring her there on the quiet and I'll try to turn up"<qe/>--this was clear enough on what so many weeks of privation had made of his desire to see the child: it even appeared to represent on his part a yearning as constant as her own.</s> <s sid="72" id="maisie.c17.s72">That in turn was just puzzling enough to make Maisie express a bewilderment.</s> <s sid="73" id="maisie.c17.s73">She couldn't see, if they were so intensely of the same mind, why the theory on which she had come back to Mrs. Beale, the general reunion, the delightful trio, should have broken down so in fact.</s> <s sid="74" id="maisie.c17.s74">Mrs. Beale furthermore only gave her more to think about in saying that their disappointment was the result of his having got into his head a kind of idea.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c17.p7" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="maisie.c17.s75"><qs/>"What kind of idea?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="maisie.c17.p8" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="maisie.c17.s76"><qs/>"Oh goodness knows!"<qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="maisie.c17.s77">She spoke with an approach to asperity.</s> <s sid="78" id="maisie.c17.s78"><qs/>"He's so awfully delicate."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="maisie.c17.p9" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="maisie.c17.s79"><qs/>"Delicate?"<qe/>--that was ambiguous.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="maisie.c17.p10" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="maisie.c17.s80"><qs/>"About what he does, don't you know?"<qe/> said Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="81" id="maisie.c17.s81">She fumbled.</s> <s sid="82" id="maisie.c17.s82"><qs/>"Well, about what WE do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="maisie.c17.p11" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="maisie.c17.s83">Maisie wondered.</s> <s sid="84" id="maisie.c17.s84"><qs/>"You and me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="maisie.c17.p12" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="maisie.c17.s85"><qs/>"Me and HIM, silly!"<qe/> cried Mrs. Beale with, this time, a real giggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="maisie.c17.p13" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="maisie.c17.s86"><qs/>"But you don't do any harm--YOU don't,"<qe/> said Maisie, wondering afresh and intending her emphasis as a decorous allusion to her parents.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="maisie.c17.p14" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="maisie.c17.s87"><qs/>"Of course we don't, you angel--that's just the ground _I_ take!"<qe/> her companion exultantly responded.</s> <s sid="88" id="maisie.c17.s88"><qs/>"He says he doesn't want you mixed up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="maisie.c17.p15" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="maisie.c17.s89"><qs/>"Mixed up with what?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="maisie.c17.p16" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="maisie.c17.s90"><qs/>"That's exactly what _I_ want to know: mixed up with what, and how you are any more mixed--?"<qe/></s> <s sid="91" id="maisie.c17.s91">Mrs. Beale paused without ending her question.</s> <s sid="92" id="maisie.c17.s92">She ended after an instant in a different way.</s> <s sid="93" id="maisie.c17.s93"><qs/>"All you can say is that it's his fancy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="maisie.c17.p17" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="maisie.c17.s94">The tone of this, in spite of its expressing a resignation, the fruit of weariness, that dismissed the subject, conveyed so vividly how much such a fancy was not Mrs. Beale's own that our young lady was led by the mere fact of contact to arrive at a dim apprehension of the unuttered and the unknown.</s> <s sid="95" id="maisie.c17.s95">The relation between her step-parents had then a mysterious residuum; this was the first time she really had reflected that except as regards herself it was not a relationship.</s> <s sid="96" id="maisie.c17.s96">To each other it was only what they might have happened to make it, and she gathered that this, in the event, had been something that led Sir Claude to keep away from her.</s> <s sid="97" id="maisie.c17.s97">Didn't he fear she would be compromised?</s> <s sid="98" id="maisie.c17.s98">The perception of such a scruple endeared him the more, and it flashed over her that she might simplify everything by showing him how little she made of such a danger.</s> <s sid="99" id="maisie.c17.s99">Hadn't she lived with her eyes on it from her third year?</s> <s sid="100" id="maisie.c17.s100">It was the condition most frequently discussed at the Faranges', where the word was always in the air and where at the age of five, amid rounds of applause, she could gabble it off.</s> <s sid="101" id="maisie.c17.s101">She knew as well in short that a person could be compromised as that a person could be slapped with a hair-brush or left alone in the dark, and it was equally familiar to her that each of these ordeals was in general held to have too little effect.</s> <s sid="102" id="maisie.c17.s102">But the first thing was to make absolutely sure of Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="103" id="maisie.c17.s103">This was done by saying to her thoughtfully:</s> <s sid="104" id="maisie.c17.s104"><qs/>"Well, if you don't mind--and you really don't, do you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="maisie.c17.p18" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="maisie.c17.s105">Mrs. Beale, with a dawn of amusement, considered.</s> <s sid="106" id="maisie.c17.s106"><qs/>"Mixing you up?</s> <s sid="107" id="maisie.c17.s107">Not a bit.</s> <s sid="108" id="maisie.c17.s108">For what does it mean?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c20.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c20.s1">The money was far too much even for a fee in a fairy-tale, and in the absence of Mrs. Beale, who, though the hour was now late, had not yet returned to the Regent's Park, Susan Ash, in the hall, as loud as Maisie was low and as bold as she was bland, produced, on the exhibition offered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a contrast to the child's recent scene of light, the half-crown that an unsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c20.s2">It was apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval Maisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like a darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table upstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a housemaid than to the subject of the manoeuvres of a quartette.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c20.s3">This subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted handkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her pillow; but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more complete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c20.s4">There were explanations indeed that Mrs. Beale had to give as well as to ask, and the most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for a little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of their sex.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c20.s5">The sovereigns were examined with some attention, the result of which, however, was to make the author of that statement desire to know what, if one really went into the matter, they could be called but the wages of sin.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c20.s6">Her companion went into it merely so far as the question of what then they were to do with them; on which Mrs. Beale, who had by this time put them into her pocket, replied with dignity and with her hand on the place:</s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c20.s7"><qs/>"We're to send them back on the spot!"<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c20.s8">Susan, the child soon afterwards learnt, had been invited to contribute to this act of restitution her one appropriated coin; but a closer clutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to Maisie that there was a limit to the way she could be <qs/>"done."<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c20.s9">Maisie had been open with Mrs. Beale about the whole of last night's transaction; but she now found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient of remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that lady's own suppressions.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c20.s10">One of these bore upon the extraordinary hour--it was three in the morning if she really wanted to know--at which Mrs. Beale had re-entered the house; another, in accents as to which Maisie's criticism was still intensely tacit, characterised her appeal as such a <qs/>"gime,"<qe/><sss/> such a <sse/><qs/>"shime,"<qe/> as one had never had to put up with; a third treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due belowstairs, in every department, for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c20.s11">Our young lady's consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her attendant's sense of wrong.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c20.s12">These days would become terrific like the Revolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the kitchen should crown them; and to promote that prospect she had through Susan's eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are prepared.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c20.s13">To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to the inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to have been the circumstance of one's being called a horrid low thief for refusing to part with one's own.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c20.s14">The redeeming point of this tension was, on the fifth day, that it actually appeared to have had to do with a breathless perception in our heroine's breast that scarcely more as the centre of Sir Claude's than as that of Susan's energies she had soon after breakfast been conveyed from London to Folkestone and established at a lovely hotel.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c20.s15">These agents, before her wondering eyes, had combined to carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed its success to the fact that Mrs. Beale had, as Susan said, but just stepped out.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c20.s16">When Sir Claude, watch in hand, had met this fact with the exclamation <qs/>"Then pack Miss Farange and come off with us!"<qe/> there had ensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring Miss Farange's heart into Miss Farange's mouth.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c20.s17">She sat with Sir Claude in a four-wheeler while he still held his watch; held it longer than any doctor who had ever felt her pulse; long enough to give her a vision of something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to show impatience.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c20.s18">The ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the Berceuse, quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day, a little while back, when Susan had panted up and she herself, after the hint about the duchess, had sailed down; for what harm then had there been in drops and disappointments if she could still have, even only a moment, the sensation of such a name "brought up"?</s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c20.s19">It had remained with her that her father had foretold her she would some day be in the street, but it clearly wouldn't be this day, and she felt justified of the preference betrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set Susan in motion and laid his hand, while she waited with him, kindly on her own.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c20.s20">This was what the Captain, in Kensington Gardens, had done; her present situation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder of the fashion after which, from the first, such pats and pulls had struck her as the steps and signs of other people's business and even a little as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c20.s21">What had failed her and what had frightened her on the night of the Exhibition lost themselves at present alike in the impression that any "surprise" now about to burst from Sir Claude would be too big to burst all at once.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c20.s22">Any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her stepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule, the odd truth that if Mrs. Beale now never came nor went without making her think of him, it was never, to balance that, the main mark of his own renewed reality to appear to be a reference to Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c20.s23">To be with Sir Claude was to think of Sir Claude, and that law governed Maisie's mind until, through a sudden lurch of the cab, which had at last taken in Susan and ever so many bundles and almost reached Charing Cross, it popped again somehow into her dizzy head the long-lost image of Mrs. Wix.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c20.p2"><s sid="24" id="maisie.c20.s24">It was singular, but from this time she understood and she followed, followed with the sense of an ample filling-out of any void created by symptoms of avoidance and of flight.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c20.s25">Her ecstasy was a thing that had yet more of a face than of a back to turn, a pair of eyes still directed to Mrs. Wix even after the slight surprise of their not finding her, as the journey expanded, either at the London station or at the Folkestone hotel.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c20.s26">It took few hours to make the child feel that if she was in neither of these places she was at least everywhere else.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c20.s27">Maisie had known all along a great deal, but never so much as she was to know from this moment on and as she learned in particular during the couple of days that she was to hang in the air, as it were, over the sea which represented in breezy blueness and with a summer charm a crossing of more spaces than the Channel.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c20.s28">It was granted her at this time to arrive at divinations so ample that I shall have no room for the goal if I attempt to trace the stages; as to which therefore I must be content to say that the fullest expression we may give to Sir Claude's conduct is a poor and pale copy of the picture it presented to his young friend.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c20.s29">Abruptly, that morning, he had yielded to the action of the idea pumped into him for weeks by Mrs. Wix on lines of approach that she had been capable of the extraordinary art of preserving from entanglement in the fine network of his relations with Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c20.s30">The breath of her sincerity, blowing without a break, had puffed him up to the flight by which, in the degree I have indicated, Maisie too was carried off her feet.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c20.s31">This consisted neither in more nor in less than the brave stroke of his getting off from Mrs. Beale as well as from his wife--of making with the child straight for some such foreign land as would give a support to Mrs. Wix's dream that she might still see his errors renounced and his delinquencies redeemed.</s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c20.s32">It would all be a sacrifice--under eyes that would miss no faintest shade--to what even the strange frequenters of her ladyship's earlier period used to call the real good of the little unfortunate.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c20.s33">Maisie's head held a suspicion of much that, during the last long interval, had confusedly, but quite candidly, come and gone in his own; a glimpse, almost awe-stricken in its gratitude, of the miracle her old governess had wrought.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c20.s34">That functionary could not in this connexion have been more impressive, even at second-hand, if she had been a prophetess with an open scroll or some ardent abbess speaking with the lips of the Church.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c20.s35">She had clung day by day to their plastic associate, plying him with her deep, narrow passion, doing her simple utmost to convert him, and so working on him that he had at last really embraced his fine chance.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c20.s36">That the chance was not delusive was sufficiently guaranteed by the completeness with which he could finally figure it out that, in case of his taking action, neither Ida nor Beale, whose book, on each side, it would only too well suit, would make any sort of row.</s> </p>

sums not grudged, however, by this lady's pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through the straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified.</s> <s sid="95" id="maisie.c22.s95">Sir Claude in truth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix's;

it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and blew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and cigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning back, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy little chimney.</s> <s sid="100" id="maisie.c22.s100">It came in spite of something that could only be named his air of wishing to put it off; an air that had served him--oh as all his airs served him!--to the extent of his having for a couple of hours confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it on the level of the little empty coffee-cups and _petits verres_ (Mrs.</s> <s sid="101" id="maisie.c22.s101">Wix had two of each!) that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the French fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they were launched.</s> <s sid="102" id="maisie.c22.s102">She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs. Wix had told her, that what this lady had come over for was not merely to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; not even to hear Sir Claude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds emitted by the English folk at the hotel.</s> <s sid="103" id="maisie.c22.s103">It was perhaps half an effect of her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody's else: she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour, of a redness associated in Maisie's mind at THAT pitch either with measles or with <qs/>"habits."<qe/></s> <s sid="104" id="maisie.c22.s104">Her heart was not at all in the gossip about Boulogne; and if her complexion was partly the result of the dejeuner and the _petits verres_ it was also the brave signal of what she was there to say.</s> <s sid="105" id="maisie.c22.s105">Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been awaited by the youngest member of the party.</s> <s sid="106" id="maisie.c22.s106"><qs/>"Her ladyship packed me off--she almost put me into the cab!"<qe/></s> <s sid="107" id="maisie.c22.s107">That was what Mrs. Wix at last brought out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c24.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="maisie.c24.s10">These powers played to no great purpose, it was true, in keeping before Mrs. Wix the vision of Sir Claude's perversity, which hung there in the pauses of talk and which he himself, after unmistakeable delays, finally made quite lurid by bursting in--it was near ten o'clock--with an object held up in his hand.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c24.s11">She knew before he spoke what it was; she knew at least from the underlying sense of all that, since the hour spent after the Exhibition with her father, had not sprung up to reinstate Mr. Farange--she knew it meant a triumph for Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c24.s12">The mere present sight of Sir Claude's face caused her on the spot to drop straight through her last impression of Mr. Farange a plummet that reached still deeper down than the security of these days of flight.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c24.s13">She had wrapped that impression in silence--a silence that had parted with half its veil to cover also, from the hour of Sir Claude's advent, the image of Mr. Farange's wife.</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c24.s14">But if the object in Sir Claude's hand revealed itself as a letter which he held up very high, so there was something in his mere motion that laid Mrs. Beale again bare.</s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c24.s15"><qs/>"Here we are!"<qe/> he cried almost from the door, shaking his trophy at them and looking from one to the other.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c24.s16">Then he came straight to Mrs. Wix; he had pulled two papers out of the envelope and glanced at them again to see which was which.</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c24.s17">He thrust one out open to Mrs. Wix.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c24.s18"><qs/>"Read that."<qe/></s> <s sid="19" id="maisie.c24.s19">She looked at him hard, as if in fear: it was impossible not to see he was excited.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c24.s20">Then she took the letter, but it was not her face that Maisie watched while she read.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c24.s21">Neither, for that matter, was it this countenance that Sir Claude scanned: he stood before the fire and, more calmly, now that he had acted, communed in silence with his stepdaughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c24.p3" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="maisie.c24.s22">The silence was in truth quickly broken; Mrs. Wix rose to her feet with the violence of the sound she emitted.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c24.s23">The letter had dropped from her and lay upon the floor; it had made her turn ghastly white and she was speechless with the effect of it.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c24.s24"><qs/>"It's too abominable--it's too unspeakable!"<qe/> she then cried.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="maisie.c24.p10" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="maisie.c24.s42">Sir Claude turned it over.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c24.s43"><qs/>"How can she get rid of him?</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c24.s44">Well--she IS rid of him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="maisie.c28.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="maisie.c28.s1">Mrs. Beale, at table between the pair, plainly attracted the attention Mrs. Wix had foretold.</s> <s sid="2" id="maisie.c28.s2">No other lady present was nearly so handsome, nor did the beauty of any other accommodate itself with such art to the homage it produced.</s> <s sid="3" id="maisie.c28.s3">She talked mainly to her other neighbour, and that left Maisie leisure both to note the manner in which eyes were riveted and nudges interchanged, and to lose herself in the meanings that, dimly as yet and disconnectedly, but with a vividness that fed apprehension, she could begin to read into her stepmother's independent move.</s> <s sid="4" id="maisie.c28.s4">Mrs. Wix had helped her by talking of a game; it was a connexion in which the move could put on a strategic air.</s> <s sid="5" id="maisie.c28.s5">Her notions of diplomacy were thin, but it was a kind of cold diplomatic shoulder and an elbow of more than usual point that, temporarily at least, were presented to her by the averted inclination of Mrs. Beale's head.</s> <s sid="6" id="maisie.c28.s6">There was a phrase familiar to Maisie, so often was it used by this lady to express the idea of one's getting what one wanted: one got it--Mrs. Beale always said SHE at all events always got it or proposed to get it--by <qs/>"making love."<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="maisie.c28.s7">She was at present making love, singular as it appeared, to Mrs. Wix, and her young friend's mind had never moved in such freedom as on thus finding itself face to face with the question of what she wanted to get.</s> <s sid="8" id="maisie.c28.s8">This period of the _omelette aux rognons_ and the poulet saute, while her sole surviving parent, her fourth, fairly chattered to her governess, left Maisie rather wondering if her governess would hold out.</s> <s sid="9" id="maisie.c28.s9">It was strange, but she became on the spot quite as interested in Mrs. Wix's moral sense as Mrs. Wix could possibly be in hers: it had risen before her so pressingly that this was something new for Mrs. Wix to resist.</s> <s sid="10" id="maisie.c28.s10">Resisting Mrs. Beale herself promised at such a rate to become a very different business from resisting Sir Claude's view of her.</s> <s sid="11" id="maisie.c28.s11">More might come of what had happened--whatever it was--than Maisie felt she could have expected.</s> <s sid="12" id="maisie.c28.s12">She put it together with a suspicion that, had she ever in her life had a sovereign changed, would have resembled an impression, baffled by the want of arithmetic, that her change was wrong: she groped about in it that she was perhaps playing the passive part in a case of violent substitution.</s> <s sid="13" id="maisie.c28.s13">A victim was what she should surely be if the issue between her step-parents had been settled by Mrs. Beale's saying:</s> <s sid="14" id="maisie.c28.s14"><qs/>"Well, if she can live with but one of us alone, with which in the world should it be but me?"<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="maisie.c28.s15">That answer was far from what, for days, she had nursed herself in, and the desolation of it was deepened by the absence of anything from Sir Claude to show he had not had to take it as triumphant.</s> <s sid="16" id="maisie.c28.s16">Had not Mrs. Beale, upstairs, as good as given out that she had quitted him with the snap of a tension, left him, dropped him in London, after some struggle as a sequel to which her own advent represented that she had practically sacrificed him?</s> <s sid="17" id="maisie.c28.s17">Maisie assisted in fancy at the probable episode in the Regent's Park, finding elements almost of terror in the suggestion that Sir Claude had not had fair play.</s> <s sid="18" id="maisie.c28.s18">They drew something, as she sat there, even from the pride of an association with such beauty as Mrs. Beale's; and the child quite forgot that, though the sacrifice of Mrs. Beale herself was a solution she had not invented, she would probably have seen Sir Claude embark upon it without a direct remonstrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="maisie.c28.p2" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="maisie.c28.s19">What her stepmother had clearly now promised herself to wring from Mrs. Wix was an assent to the great modification, the change, as smart as a juggler's trick, in the interest of which nothing so much mattered as the new convenience of Mrs. Beale.</s> <s sid="20" id="maisie.c28.s20">Maisie could positively seize the moral that her elbow seemed to point in ribs thinly defended--the moral of its not mattering a straw which of the step-parents was the guardian.</s> <s sid="21" id="maisie.c28.s21">The essence of the question was that a girl wasn't a boy: if Maisie had been a mere rough trousered thing, destined at the best probably to grow up a scamp, Sir Claude would have been welcome.</s> <s sid="22" id="maisie.c28.s22">As the case stood he had simply tumbled out of it, and Mrs. Wix would henceforth find herself in the employ of the right person.</s> <s sid="23" id="maisie.c28.s23">These arguments had really fallen into their place, for our young friend, at the very touch of that tone in which she had heard her new title declared.</s> <s sid="24" id="maisie.c28.s24">She was still, as a result of so many parents, a daughter to somebody even after papa and mamma were to all intents dead.</s> <s sid="25" id="maisie.c28.s25">If her father's wife and her mother's husband, by the operation of a natural or, for all she knew, a legal rule, were in the shoes of their defunct partners, then Mrs. Beale's partner was exactly as defunct as Sir Claude's and her shoes the very pair to which, in <qs/>"Farange _v._ Farange and Others,"<qe/> the divorce court had given priority.</s> <s sid="26" id="maisie.c28.s26">The subject of that celebrated settlement saw the rest of her day really filled out with the pomp of all that Mrs. Beale assumed.</s> <s sid="27" id="maisie.c28.s27">The assumption rounded itself there between this lady's entertainers, flourished in a way that left them, in their bottomless element, scarce a free pair of eyes to exchange signals.</s> <s sid="28" id="maisie.c28.s28">It struck Maisie even a little that there was a rope or two Mrs. Wix might have thrown out if she would, a rocket or two she might have sent up.</s> <s sid="29" id="maisie.c28.s29">They had at any rate never been so long together without communion or telegraphy, and their companion kept them apart by simply keeping them with her.</s> <s sid="30" id="maisie.c28.s30">From this situation they saw the grandeur of their intenser relation to her pass and pass like an endless procession.</s> <s sid="31" id="maisie.c28.s31">It was a day of lively movement and of talk on Mrs. Beale's part so brilliant and overflowing as to represent music and banners.</s> <s sid="32" id="maisie.c28.s32">She took them out with her promptly to walk and to drive, and even--towards night--sketched a plan for carrying them to the Etablissement, where, for only a franc apiece, they should listen to a concert of celebrities.</s> <s sid="33" id="maisie.c28.s33">It reminded Maisie, the plan, of the side-shows at Earl's Court, and the franc sounded brighter than the shillings which had at that time failed; yet this too, like the other, was a frustrated hope: the francs failed like the shillings and the side-shows had set an example to the concert.</s> <s sid="34" id="maisie.c28.s34">The Etablissement in short melted away, and it was little wonder that a lady who from the moment of her arrival had been so gallantly in the breach should confess herself it last done up.</s> <s sid="35" id="maisie.c28.s35">Maisie could appreciate her fatigue; the day had not passed without such an observer's discovering that she was excited and even mentally comparing her state to that of the breakers after a gale.</s> <s sid="36" id="maisie.c28.s36">It had blown hard in London, and she would take time to go down.</s> <s sid="37" id="maisie.c28.s37">It was of the condition known to the child by report as that of talking against time that her emphasis, her spirit, her humour, which had never dropped, now gave the impression.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="maisie.c28.p3" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="maisie.c28.s38">She too was delighted with foreign manners; but her daughter's opportunities of explaining them to her were unexpectedly forestalled by her own tone of large acquaintance with them.</s> <s sid="39" id="maisie.c28.s39">One of the things that nipped in the bud all response to her volubility was Maisie's surprised retreat before the fact that Continental life was what she had been almost brought up on.</s> <s sid="40" id="maisie.c28.s40">It was Mrs. Beale, disconcertingly, who began to explain it to her friends; it was she who, wherever they turned, was the interpreter, the historian and the guide.</s> <s sid="41" id="maisie.c28.s41">She was full of reference to her early travels--at the age of eighteen: she had at that period made, with a distinguished Dutch family, a stay on the Lake of Geneva.</s> <s sid="42" id="maisie.c28.s42">Maisie had in the old days been regaled with anecdotes of these adventures, but they had with time become phantasmal, and the heroine's quite showy exemption from bewilderment at Boulogne, her acuteness on some of the very subjects on which Maisie had been acute to Mrs. Wix, were a high note of the majesty, of the variety of advantage, with which she had alighted.</s> <s sid="43" id="maisie.c28.s43">It was all a part of the wind in her sails and of the weight with which her daughter was now to feel her hand.</s> <s sid="44" id="maisie.c28.s44">The effect of it on Maisie was to add already the burden of time to her separation from Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="45" id="maisie.c28.s45">This might, to her sense, have lasted for days; it was as if, with their main agitation transferred thus to France and with neither mamma now nor Mrs. Beale nor Mrs. Wix nor herself at his side, he must be fearfully alone in England.</s> <s sid="46" id="maisie.c28.s46">Hour after hour she felt as if she were waiting; yet she couldn't have said exactly for what.</s> <s sid="47" id="maisie.c28.s47">There were moments when Mrs. Beale's flow of talk was a mere rattle to smother a knock.</s> <s sid="48" id="maisie.c28.s48">At no part of the crisis had the rattle so public a purpose as when, instead of letting Maisie go with Mrs. Wix to prepare for dinner, she pushed her--with a push at last incontestably maternal--straight into the room inherited from Sir Claude.</s> <s sid="49" id="maisie.c28.s49">She titivated her little charge with her own brisk hands; then she brought out:</s> <s sid="50" id="maisie.c28.s50"><qs/>"I'm going to divorce your father."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="maisie.c28.p4" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="maisie.c28.s51">This was so different from anything Maisie had expected that it took some time to reach her mind.</s> <s sid="52" id="maisie.c28.s52">She was aware meanwhile that she probably looked rather wan.</s> <s sid="53" id="maisie.c28.s53"><qs/>"To marry Sir Claude?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="maisie.c28.p5" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="maisie.c28.s54">Mrs. Beale rewarded her with a kiss.</s> <s sid="55" id="maisie.c28.s55"><qs/>"It's sweet to hear you put it so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="maisie.c28.p6" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="maisie.c28.s56">This was a tribute, but it left Maisie balancing for an objection.</s> <s sid="57" id="maisie.c28.s57"><qs/>"How CAN you when he's married?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="maisie.c28.p7" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="maisie.c28.s58"><qs/>"He isn't--practically.</s> <s sid="59" id="maisie.c28.s59">He's free, you know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="maisie.c28.p10" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="maisie.c28.s62">The benefit that, these last days, she had felt she owed a certain person left Maisie a moment so ill-prepared for recognising this lurid label that she hesitated long enough to risk:</s> <s sid="63" id="maisie.c28.s63"><qs/>"Mamma?"<qe/></s> </p>
