<title>The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's</title>
<author>Talbot Baines Reed</author>
<p pid="1" id="dominics.c0.p1"><s>PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dominics.c0.p2"><s>_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is a story of public-school life, and was written for the _Boy's Own Paper_, in the Fourth Volume of which it appeared.</s> <s>The numbers containing it are now either entirely out of print or difficult to obtain; and many and urgent have been the requests--from boys themselves, as well as from parents, head masters, and others--for its re-issue as a book.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dominics.c0.p3"><s>Of the story itself little need be said.</s> <s>It deals in a bright and vigorous style with the kaleidoscopic, throbbing life of a great public school--that world in miniature which, in its daily opportunities and temptations, ambitions and failures, has so often afforded superabundant material for narratives powerful to enchain the attention and sway the emotions, whether to smiles or tears.</s> <s>This will take its place, amongst the best of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dominics.c0.p4"><s>Though the story is one of school life, its interest is by no means limited to school or college walls.</s> <s>Boys of all sorts and conditions-- ay, and their parents too--will follow its fortunes with unflagging zest from the first page to the last; and it is difficult to conceive of any reader, be he young or old, who would not be the better for its vivid portraiture and bracing atmosphere.</s> <s>There is a breeziness about it calculated to stir the better life in the most sluggish; and without pretence or affectation it rings out its warnings, no less than its notes of cheer, clear and rousing as trumpet blasts.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dominics.c0.p5"><s>"Do right, and thou hast nought to fear, Right hath a power that makes thee strong; The night is dark, but light is near, The grief is short, the joy is long."</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dominics.c0.p6"><s>Without the most distant approach to that fatal kind of sermonising which all but inevitably repels those whom it is meant to benefit, the story forcefully illustrates how rapidly they may sink who once tamper, for seeming present advantage, with truth, and how surely, sooner or later, a noble character comes to vindication and honour; and in all such respects it is eminently true to life.</s> <s>These boys of Saint Dominic's, even the best of them, are very human--neither angels nor monstrosities, but, for the most part, ardent, impulsive, out-and-out, work-a-day lads; with the faults and failings of inexperience and impetuosity, no doubt, but also with that moral grit and downright honesty of purpose that are still, we believe, the distinguishing mark of the true British public-school boy.</s> <s>Hence one is impelled to take from the outset a most genuine interest in them and their affairs, and to feel quite as though one had known many of them personally for years, and been distinctly the better, too, for that knowledge.</s> <s>Such boys stand at the antipodes alike of the unreal abstractions of an effeminate sentimentalism--the paragons who prate platitudes and die young--and of the morbid specimens of youthful infamy only too frequently paraded by the equally unreal sensationalism of to-day to meet the cravings of a vitiated taste.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dominics.c0.p7"><s>_The Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's_ is the kind of book we should place with confidence in the hands of our own boys when leaving the home shelter, whether for school or the sterner after-battle; and we cannot conceive of the parent who, having read it with care and pleasure, as we have done, and knowing at the same time anything of the stress and strain of daily life, would not, with gratitude to the author, gladly do the same.</s> <s>With all their faults, Oliver Greenfield and Wraysford are splendid boys, of just the fibre that the Church needs, and the world cannot afford to do without; and yet their school career proves by no means a bed of roses.</s> <s>To drift with the current is proverbially easy; to seek to stem it manfully, and steer by the stars, may, and often does, lay one open to misapprehension or envy, and all the ills that follow in their train; yet--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dominics.c0.p8"><s>"God is God, and right is right, And truth the day must win; To doubt would be disloyalty, To falter would be sin."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dominics.c0.p9"><s>Our heroes had their full share of trouble--what real hero has not?--but they come out of the ordeal purified and strengthened, with nobler aspirations after duty, and tenderer thoughts of helpfulness towards those needing, if far from seeking, their succouring arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dominics.c0.p10"><s>How all this comes about it is not for us to tell.</s> <s>Readers will find that out for themselves, and thank us for allowing them, unaided, to do so.</s> <s>The school cricket match, the grand football struggle, the ever-memorable prize-day--these are matters that no alien pen may touch.</s> <s>Our prayer is that God may abundantly bless the book to the building up in our schools and families of strong Christian characters, who in the after days shall do valiant service for Christ and humanity.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dominics.c0.p12"><s>CHAPTER ONE.</s> <s>THE NOTICE BOARD.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dominics.c0.p13"><s>The four o'clock bell was sounding up the staircase and down the passages of Saint Dominic's school.</s> <s>It was a minute behind its time, and had old Roach, the school janitor, guessed at half the abuse privately aimed at his devoted head for this piece of negligence, he might have pulled the rope with a good deal more vivacity than he at present displayed.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dominics.c0.p14"><s>At the signal there was a general shuffling of feet and uproar of voices--twelve doors swung open almost simultaneously, and next moment five hundred boys poured out, flooding the staircases and passages, shouting, scuffling, and laughing, and throwing off by one easy effort the restraint and gravity of the last six hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dominics.c0.p15"><s>The usual rush and scramble ensued.</s> <s>Some boys, taking off their coats and tucking up their sleeves as they ran, made headlong for the playground.</s> <s>Some, with books under their arms, scuttled off to their studies.</s> <s>The heroes of the Sixth stalked majestically to their quarters.</s> <s>The day boarders hurried away to catch the train at Maltby.</s> <s>A few slunk sulkily to answer to their names in the detention-room, and others, with the air of men to whom time is no object and exertion no temptation, lounged about in the corridors with hands in pockets, regarding listlessly the general stampede of their fellows, and apparently not knowing exactly what to do with themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dominics.c0.p16"><s>Among these last happened to be Bullinger of the Fifth and his particular friend Ricketts, who, neither of them having any more tempting occupation, were comfortably leaning up against the door of the Fourth junior class-room, thereby making prisoners of some twenty or thirty youngsters, whose infuriated yells and howls from within appeared to afford the two gentlemen a certain languid satisfaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dominics.c0.p17"><s>"Open the door! do you hear?" shrieked one little treble voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dominics.c0.p18"><s>"All right!" piped another.</s> <s>"I know who you are, you cads.</s> <s>See if I don't tell Dr Senior!"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dominics.c0.p19"><s>"Oh, please, I say, I shall lose my train!" whimpered a third.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dominics.c0.p20"><s>"Wait till I get out; see if I don't kick your shins!" howled a fourth.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dominics.c0.p21" type="speech"><s>It was no use.</s> <s>In vain these bantams stormed and raved, and entreated and blubbered.</s> <s>The handle would not turn, and the door would not yield.</s> <s>Mr Bullinger and his friend vouchsafed no reply, either to their threats or their supplications, and how long the blockade might have lasted it is impossible to say, had not a fresh dissension called the beleaguerers away.</s> <s>A cluster of boys at a corner of the big corridor near the main entrance attracted their curiosity, and suggested a possibility of even more entertainment than the goading into fury of a parcel of little boys, so, taking advantage of a moment when the besieged had combined, shoulder to shoulder, to make one magnificent and desperate onslaught on to the obdurate door, they quietly <qs/>"raised the siege,"<qe/> and quitting their hold, left the phalanx of small heroes to topple head over heels and one over another on to the stone floor of the passage, while they sauntered off arm-in-arm to the scene of the new excitement.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="dominics.c0.p22"><s>The object which had attracted the knot of boys whom they now joined was the School Notice Board, on which, from time to time, were posted notices of general and particular interest to the school.</s> <s>On this particular afternoon (the first Friday of the Summer term) it was, as usual, crowded with announcements, each interesting in its way.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="dominics.c0.p23"><s>The first was in the handwriting of Dr Senior's secretary, and ran as follows:--</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dominics.c0.p24"><s>"A Nightingale Scholarship, value 50 pounds a year for three years, will fall vacant at Michaelmas.</s> <s>Boys under seventeen are eligible.</s> <s>Particulars and subject of examination can be had any evening next week in the secretary's room."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dominics.c0.p25"><s>"Fifty-pounds a year _for_ three years!" exclaimed a small boy, with a half whistle.</s> <s>"I wouldn't mind getting that!"</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dominics.c0.p26"><s>"Well, why don't you, you avaricious young Jew?</s> <s>You're under seventeen, I suppose?" retorted the amiable Mr Bullinger, thereby raising a laugh at the expense of this little boy of eleven, who retired from the scene extinguished.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="dominics.c0.p27"><s>The next notice was in the classical handwriting of the secretary of the Sixth Form Literary Society, and ran as follows:--</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="dominics.c0.p28"><s>"This Society will meet on Tuesday.</s> <s>Subject for debate, `That the present age is degenerate,' moved by A.E. Callander, opposed by T. Winter.</s> <s>Boys from the Senior Fifth are invited as auditors."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="dominics.c0.p29" type="speech"><s>This notice, even with the patronising postscript, would have passed without comment, as Sixth Form notices usually did, had not some audacious hand ventured to alter a word and make the subject of debate, instead of <qs/>"That the present age is degenerate,"<qe/><sss/> read <sse/><qs/>"That the present Sixth is degenerate."<qe/></s> <s>Who the perpetrator of this outrage might be was a mystery, but the alteration was quite enough to render the notice very amusing to many of the readers, especially the Fifth Form boys, and very terrible to others, especially the small boys, who looked nervous and guilty, and did not dare by the slightest sign to join in the mirth of their irreverent seniors.</s> <s>Most of the assembly agreed that <qs/>"there would be a row about it,"<qe/> with which assurance they passed on to the next notice.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="dominics.c0.p30"><s>"Wanted, a Smart Fag.</s> <s>No Tadpoles or Guinea-pigs need apply.</s> <s>Horace Wraysford, Fifth Form."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dominics.c0.p31"><s>"Bravo, Horatius!" said Ricketts.</s> <s>"A lucky young cub it will be that he takes on," added he, turning to a group of the small boys near.</s> <s>"He'll do your sums and look over your exercises for you like one o'clock.</s> <s>Ugh! though, I suppose every man Jack of you is a Tadpole or a Pig?"</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dominics.c0.p32"><s>Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs, I should say, were the names given to two combinations or clubs in the clannish Junior School, the mysteries of which were known only to their members, but which were not regarded with favour by the older boys.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dominics.c0.p33"><s>As no one answered this charge, Ricketts indulged in a few general threats, and a few not very complimentary comments on the clubs in question, and then returned to the notice board, which contained two more announcements.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dominics.c0.p34"><s>"Cricket Notices.</s> <s>To-morrow will be a final big practice, when the elevens for the `A to M _versus_ N to Z' match on the 25th will be chosen.</s> <s>`Sixth _versus_ School' will be played on the 1st proxo.</s> <s>The School Eleven will be selected from among players in the two above matches."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="dominics.c0.p35"><s>"A private meeting of the Fifth will be held this afternoon at 4.30 to discuss an important matter."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="dominics.c0.p36" type="speech"><s>"Hullo!" said Bullinger, looking up at the clock, <qs/>"it's half-past now!</s> <s>Come along, Rick."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="dominics.c0.p37"><s>And the two demagogues disappeared arm-in-arm down the passage, followed by the admiring glances of the juniors, who spent the next half-hour in wondering what could be the important matter under consideration at the private meeting of the Fifth.</s> <s>The universal conclusion was that it had reference to the suppression of the Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs--a proceeding the very suggestion of which made those small animals tremble with mingled rage and fear, and sent them off wriggling to their own quarters, there to deliberate on the means of defence necessary to protect themselves from the common enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="dominics.c0.p38"><s>The meeting in the Fifth, however, was to consider a far more important subject than the rebellious clubs of the Junior School.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="dominics.c0.p39"><s>The reader will doubtless have inferred, from what has already been said, that the young gentlemen of the Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's entertained, among other emotions, a sentiment something like jealousy of their seniors and superiors in the sixth.</s> <s>Perhaps Saint Dominic's is not the only school in which such a feeling has existed; but, at any rate during the particular period to which I am referring, it was pretty strong there.</s> <s>Not that the two Forms were at war, or that there was any fear of actual hostilities.</s> <s>It was not so bad as all that.</s> <s>But the Fifth were too near the heroes of the top Form to consent to submit to their authority.</s> <s>They would be Sixth men themselves soon, and then of course they would expect the whole school to reverence them.</s> <s>But till that time they resented the idea of bowing before these future comrades; and not only that, they took every opportunity of asserting their authority among the juniors, and claiming the allegiance for themselves they refused to render to others.</s> <s>And they succeeded in this very well, for they took pains to make themselves popular in the school, and to appear as the champions quite as much as the bullies of the small fry.</s> <s>The consequence was that while Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs quaked and blushed in the presence of the majestic Sixth, they quaked and smirked in the presence of the Fifth, and took their thrashings meekly, in the hope of getting a Latin exercise looked over or a minor tyrant punished later on.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="dominics.c0.p40"><s>Just at the present time, too, the Fifth was made up of a set of fellows well able to maintain the peculiar traditions of their fellowship.</s> <s>They numbered one or two of the cleverest boys (for their age) in Saint Dominic's; and, more important still in the estimation of many, they numbered not a few of the best cricketers, boxers, football-players, and runners in the school.</s> <s>With these advantages their popularity as a body was very great--and it is only due to them to say that they bore their honours magnanimously, and distributed their kicks and favours with the strictest impartiality.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="dominics.c0.p41" type="speech"><s>Such was the company which assembled on this afternoon in their own class-room, with closed doors, to deliberate on <qs/>"private and important business."<qe/></s> <s>About twenty boys were present, and the reader must let me introduce a few of them, before his curiosity as to the occasion of their assembling themselves together can be satisfied.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="dominics.c0.p42"><s>That handsome, jovial-looking boy of sixteen who is sitting there astride of a chair, in the middle of the floor, biting the end of a quill pen, is the redoubtable Horace Wraysford, the gentleman, it will be remembered, who is in want of a fag.</s> <s>Wraysford is one of the best "all-round men" in the Fifth, or indeed in the school.</s> <s>He is certain to be in the School Eleven against the County, certain to win the mile race and the "hurdles" at the Athletic Sports, and is not at all unlikely to carry off the Nightingale Scholarship next autumn, even though one of the Sixth is in for it too.</s> <s>Indeed, it is said he would be quite certain of this honour, were it not that his friend and rival Oliver Greenfield, who is standing there against the wall, with his head resting on a map of Greece, is also in for it.</s> <s>Greenfield does not strike one as nearly so brilliant a fellow as his friend.</s> <s>He is quieter and more lazy, and more solemn.</s> <s>Some say he has a temper, and others that he is selfish; and generally he is not the most popular boy in Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>Wraysford, however, sticks to him through thick and thin, and declares that, so far from being ill-tempered and selfish, he is one of the best fellows in the school, and one of the cleverest.</s> <s>And Mr Wraysford is prepared to maintain his allegation at the point of the--knuckle!</s> <s>That hulking, ugly youth is Braddy, the bully, the terror of the Guinea-pigs, and the laughing-stock of his own class-mates.</s> <s>The boy who is fastening a chalk duster on to the collar of Braddy's coat is Tom Senior, the Doctor's eldest son, who, one would have imagined, might have learned better manners.</s> <s>Last, not least (for we need not re-introduce Messrs.</s> <s>Ricketts or Bullinger, or go out of our way to present Simon, the donkey of the Form, to the reader), is Master Anthony Pembury, the boy now mounting up onto a chair with the aid of two friends.</s> <s>Anthony is lame, and one of the most dreaded boys in Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>His father is editor of the _Great Britain_, and the son seems to have inherited his talent for saying sharp things.</s> <s>Woe betide the Dominican who raises Tony's dander!</s> <s>He cannot box, he cannot pursue; but he can _talk_, and he can ridicule, as his victims all the school over know.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="dominics.c0.p43"><s>He it is who has, of his own sweet will, summoned together the present meeting, and the business he is now about to explain.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="dominics.c0.p44" type="speech"><s>"The fact is, you fellows," he begins, <qs/>"I wanted to ask your opinion about a little idea of my own.</s> <s>You know the _Sixth Form Magazine_?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="dominics.c0.p45" type="speech"><s>"Rather," says Ricketts; <qs/>"awful rubbish too!</s> <s>Papers a mile long in it about Greek roots; and poetry about the death of Seneca, and all that sort of thing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="dominics.c0.p46" type="speech"><s>"That's just it," continued Pembury; <qs/>"it's rubbish, and unreadable; and though they condescend to let us see it, I don't suppose two fellows in the Form ever wade through it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="dominics.c0.p47"><s>"I know _I don't_, for one," says Wraysford, laughing; "I _did_ make a start at that ode on the birth of Senior junior in the last, which began with--</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="dominics.c0.p48"><s>"`Hark, 'tis the wail of an infant that wakes the still echoes of lofty Olympus,'</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="dominics.c0.p49"><s>"but I got no farther."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="dominics.c0.p50" type="speech"><s>"Yes," says Tom Senior, <qs/>"Wren wrote that.</s> <s>I felt it my duty to challenge him for insulting the family, you know.</s> <s>But he said it was meant as a compliment, and that the Doctor was greatly pleased with it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="dominics.c0.p51" type="speech"><s>"Well," resumed Pembury, laughing, <qs/>"they won't allow any of us to contribute.</s> <s>I suggested it to the editor, and he said (you know his stuck-up way), `They saw no reason for opening their columns to any but Sixth Form fellows.'</s> <s>So what I propose is, that we get up a paper of our own!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="dominics.c0.p52"><s>"Upon my word, it's a splendid idea!" exclaimed Wraysford, jumping up in raptures.</s> <s>And every one else applauded Pembury's proposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="dominics.c0.p53" type="speech"><s>"We've as good a right, you know," he continued, <qs/>"as they have, and ought to be able to turn out quite as respectable a paper."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="dominics.c0.p54" type="speech"><s>"Rather," says Ricketts, <qs/>"if you'll only get the fellows to write."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="dominics.c0.p55"><s>"Oh, I'll manage that," said Anthony.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="dominics.c0.p56"><s>"Of course you'll have to be editor, Tony," says Bullinger.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="dominics.c0.p57"><s>"If you like," says the bashful Tony, who had no notion of _not_ being editor.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="dominics.c0.p58"><s>"Well, I call that a splendid idea," says Braddy.</s> <s>"Won't they be in a fury?</s> <s>(Look here, Senior, I wish you wouldn't stick your pins into my neck, do you hear?)"</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="dominics.c0.p59"><s>"What shall we call it?" some one asks.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="dominics.c0.p60" type="speech"><s>"Ah, yes," says Pembury, <qs/>"we ought to give it a good name."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="dominics.c0.p61"><s>"Call it the _Senior Wrangler_," suggested Ricketts.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="dominics.c0.p62"><s>"Sounds too like a family concern," cried Tom Senior.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="dominics.c0.p63"><s>"Suppose we call it the _Fifth Form War Whoop_," proposed Wraysford, amid much laughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="dominics.c0.p64"><s>"Or the _Anti-Sixth_," says Braddy, who always professes an implacable enmity towards the Sixth when none of them are near to hear him.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="dominics.c0.p65"><s>"Not at all," says Greenfield, speaking now for the first time.</s> <s>"What's the use of making fools of ourselves?</s> <s>Call it the _Dominican_, and let it be a paper for the whole school."</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="dominics.c0.p66"><s>"Greenfield is right," adds Pembury.</s> <s>"If we can make it a regular school paper it will be a far better slap at the Sixth than if we did nothing but pitch into them.</s> <s>Look here, you fellows, leave it to me to get out the first number.</s> <s>We'll astonish the lives out of them--you see!"</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="dominics.c0.p67"><s>Every one is far too confident of Tony's capacity to raise an objection to this proposal; and after a good deal more talk, in which the idea of the _Dominican_ excites quite an enthusiasm among these amiable young gentlemen, the meeting breaks up.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="dominics.c0.p68"><s>That evening, as the fellows passed down the corridor to prayers, a new notice appeared on the board:</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="dominics.c0.p69"><s>"The first number of the _Dominican_ will appear on the 24th inst."</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="dominics.c0.p70" type="speech"><s>"What does it mean?" asked Raleigh of the Sixth, the school captain, of his companion, as they stopped to examine this mysterious announcement; <qs/>"there's no name to it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="dominics.c0.p71"><s>"I suppose it's another prank of the Fifth.</s> <s>By the way, do you see how one of them has altered this debating society notice?"</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="dominics.c0.p72" type="speech"><s>"Upon my word," said Raleigh reading it, and smiling in spite of himself, <qs/>"they are getting far too impudent.</s> <s>I must send a monitor to complain of this."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="dominics.c0.p73"><s>And so the two grandees walked on.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="dominics.c0.p74"><s>Later in the evening Greenfield and Wraysford sat together in the study of the former.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="dominics.c0.p75"><s>"Well, I see the Nightingale is vacant at last.</s> <s>Of course you are going in, old man?" said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="dominics.c0.p76"><s>"Yes, I suppose so; and you?" asked the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="dominics.c0.p77"><s>"Oh, yes.</s> <s>I'll have a shot, and do my best."</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="dominics.c0.p78" type="speech"><s>"I don't mean to let you have it, though," said Greenfield, <qs/>"for the money would be valuable to me if I ever go up to Oxford."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="dominics.c0.p79"><s>"Just the reason I want to get it," said Wraysford, laughing.</s> <s>"By the way, when is your young brother coming?"</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="dominics.c0.p80"><s>"This week, I expect."</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="dominics.c0.p81"><s>"I wonder if he'll fag for me?" asked Wraysford, mindful of his destitute condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="dominics.c0.p82"><s>Greenfield laughed.</s> <s>"You'd better ask the captain about that.</s> <s>I can't answer for him.</s> <s>But I must be off now.</s> <s>Good-night."</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="dominics.c0.p83"><s>And an hour after that Saint Dominic's was as still and silent as, during the day, it had been bustling and noisy.</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="dominics.c0.p84"><s>CHAPTER TWO.</s> <s>A NEW BOY.</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="dominics.c0.p85"><s>"Good-Bye, my boy; God bless you! and don't forget to tell the housekeeper about airing your flannel vests."</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="dominics.c0.p86"><s>With this final benediction ringing in his ears, the train which was to carry Master Stephen Greenfield from London to Saint Dominic's steamed slowly out of the station, leaving his widowed mother to return lonely and sorrowful to the home from which, before this day, her youngest son had never wandered far without her.</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="dominics.c0.p127"><s>Before Oliver arrived, four visitors broke in upon Stephen's vigil.</s> <s>The first came "to borrow" some tea, and helped himself coolly to two teaspoonfuls out of Oliver's canister.</s> <s>Stephen stood by aghast and speechless.</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="dominics.c0.p132" type="speech"><s>"How are you?" said Wraysford, in a voice which won over Stephen at once; <qs/>"I heard you were coming.</s> <s>Have you--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="dominics.c0.p133"><s>"Oh!" suddenly ejaculated Oliver, lifting up the lid of his teapot.</s> <s>"If that young wretch Paul hasn't been and made my tea with coal-dust and cold water!</s> <s>I'd like to scrag him!</s> <s>And--upon my word--oh, this is too much!--just look, Wray, how he's laid the table out!</s> <s>Those Guinea-pigs are beyond all patience.</s> <s>Where _is_ the beggar?"</s> </p>

<p pid="142" id="dominics.c0.p142"><s>"I'll speak to the captain, anyhow," growled Wraysford, sitting down to his tea.</s> </p>

<p pid="143" id="dominics.c0.p143"><s>All this was not very pleasant for Stephen, who gathered that he was destined to serve a not very desirable personage in the capacity of fag, instead of, as he would have liked, his brother's friend Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="144" id="dominics.c0.p144"><s>However, he did justice to the tea, bad as it was, and the sardines Oliver had brought from Maltby.</s> <s>He was relieved, too, to find that his brother was not greatly exasperated on hearing of the various raids which had been made on his provisions, or greatly disconcerted at Mr Bullinger's modest request for half a pint of jam.</s> </p>

<p pid="145" id="dominics.c0.p145"><s>Then, as the talk fell upon home, and cricket, and other cheerful topics, the small boy gradually forgot his troubles, even down to the Fiji War, and finished up his first evening at Saint Dominic's in a good deal more cheerful frame of mind than that in which he had begun it.</s> </p>

<p pid="148" id="dominics.c0.p148"><s>This circumstance gave great satisfaction to the new boy when his brother told him of it, as it put off for another twenty-four hours the awful moment when he would be forced to expose his ignorance before that terrible personage.</s> </p>

<p pid="152" id="dominics.c0.p152"><s>Here, no one cared for him, every one seemed to despise him.</s> <s>He wasn't used to those rough public schools, and would never get on at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>Ah! that wretched Tenth Fiji War.</s> <s>What _would_ become of him to-morrow when the Doctor would be back?</s> <s>There was no one to help him.</s> <s>Even Oliver seemed determined to let him fight his own battles.</s> </p>

<p pid="153" id="dominics.c0.p153"><s>Poor boy!</s> <s>He sat back in his chair and let his mind wander once more back to the snug little home he had left.</s> <s>And, as he did so, his eyes unconsciously filled with tears, and he felt as if he would give anything to escape from Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="258" id="dominics.c0.p258"><s>And so the practice went on, each candidate for the honour of a place in the eleven submitting to the ordeal, and being applauded or despised according as he acquitted himself.</s> <s>Wraysford, of course, came out of the trial well, as he always did.</s> </p>

<p pid="431" id="dominics.c0.p431"><s>Stephen, who was beginning to feel himself much more at home at Saint Dominic's, betrayed no visible terror at these menaces, and only once took any notice of his exalted enemy, when the latter attempted not only to stand on the form, but upon a tail of Stephen's jacket, and a bit of the flesh of his leg at the same time.</s> <s>Then he gave the offending foot a knock with his fist and an admonitory push.</s> </p>

<p pid="436" id="dominics.c0.p436"><s>Directly class was over, Stephen had to go and wait upon Loman for a particular purpose, which the reader must hear of in due time.</s> </p>

<p pid="437" id="dominics.c0.p437"><s>CHAPTER SIX.</s> <s>MR CRIPPS THE YOUNGER.</s> </p>

<p pid="438" id="dominics.c0.p438"><s>Loman was a comparatively new boy at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>He had entered eighteen months ago, in the Fifth Form, having come direct from another school.</s> <s>He was what many persons would call an agreeable boy, although for some reason or other he was never very popular.</s> <s>What that something was, no one could exactly define.</s> <s>He was clever, and good-tempered, and inoffensive.</s> <s>He rarely quarrelled or interfered with any one, and he had been known to do more than one good-natured act.</s> <s>But whether it was that he was conceited, or selfish, or not quite straight, or a little bit of all three, he never made any very great friends at Saint Dominic's, and since he had got into the Sixth and been made a monitor, he had quite lost the favour of his old comrades in the Fifth.</s> </p>

<p pid="439" id="dominics.c0.p439"><s>As far as Wraysford and Greenfield were concerned, this absence of goodwill had ripened into something like soreness, by the way in which Loman had made use of his own position as a monitor, on a casual reference by Oliver to the probable coming of Stephen to Saint Dominic's, to secure that young gentleman as his fag, although he quite well knew that Wraysford was counting on having him.</s> <s>Though of course the captain's word was final, the two friends felt that they had not been quite fairly dealt with in the matter.</s> <s>They took no trouble to conceal what they thought from Loman himself, who seemed to derive considerable satisfaction from the fact, and to determine to keep his hand on the new boy quite as much for the sake of "scoring off" his rivals as on the fag's own account.</s> </p>

<p pid="440" id="dominics.c0.p440"><s>Loman, Wraysford, and Greenfield _were_ rivals in more matters than one.</s> <s>They were all three candidates for a place in the school eleven, and all three candidates for the Nightingale Scholarship next autumn; and besides this, they each of them aspired to control the Junior Dominicans; and it was a sore mortification to Loman to find that, though a monitor, his influence among the small fry was by no means as great as that of the two Fifth Form boys, who were notoriously popular, and thought much of by their juniors.</s> </p>

<p pid="441" id="dominics.c0.p441" type="speech"><s>For these and other reasons, the relations between the two friends and Loman were at the present time a little <qs/>"strained."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="442" id="dominics.c0.p442"><s>To Stephen, however, Loman was all civility.</s> <s>He helped him in his lessons, and gave him the reversion of his feasts, and exercised his monitorial authority against Master Bramble in a way that quite charmed the new boy, and made him consider himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of so considerate a lord.</s> </p>

<p pid="443" id="dominics.c0.p443"><s>When he entered Loman's study after his first morning's work in class, he found that youth in a highly amiable frame of mind, and delighted to see him.</s> </p>

<p pid="444" id="dominics.c0.p444" type="speech"><s>"Hullo, Greenfield!" he said; <qs/>"how are you? and how are you getting on?</s> <s>I hear you are in the Fourth Junior; all among the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, eh?</s> <s>Which do you belong to?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="445" id="dominics.c0.p445" type="speech"><s>"I don't know," said Stephen; <qs/>"they are going to draw lots for me to-morrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="446" id="dominics.c0.p446"><s>"That's a nice way of being elected!</s> <s>I say, have you any classes this afternoon?"</s> </p>

<p pid="447" id="dominics.c0.p447"><s>"No; Mr Rastle has given us a half-holiday."</s> </p>

<p pid="448" id="dominics.c0.p448"><s>"That's just the thing.</s> <s>I'm going to scull up the river a bit after dinner, and if you'd like you can come and steer for me."</s> </p>

<p pid="449" id="dominics.c0.p449"><s>Stephen was delighted.</s> <s>Of all things he liked boating.</s> <s>They lived near a river at home, he said, and he always used to steer for Oliver there.</s> </p>

<p pid="450" id="dominics.c0.p450"><s>So, as soon as dinner was over, the two went down to the boathouse and embarked.</s> </p>

<p pid="451" id="dominics.c0.p451"><s>"Which way shall you row?" asked Stephen, as he made himself comfortable in the stern of the boat, and took charge of the rudder-lines.</s> </p>

<p pid="452" id="dominics.c0.p452"><s>"Oh, up stream.</s> <s>Keep close in to the bank, out of the current."</s> </p>

<p pid="453" id="dominics.c0.p453"><s>It was a beautiful afternoon, and Loman paddled lazily and luxuriously up, giving ample time to Stephen, if so inclined, to admire the wooded banks and picturesque windings of the Shar.</s> <s>Gusset Lock was reached in due time, and here Loman suggested that Stephen should get out and go round and look at the weir, while he went on and took the boat through.</s> <s>Stephen acceded and landed, and Loman paddled on to the lock.</s> </p>

<p pid="454" id="dominics.c0.p454"><s>"Hello, maister," called down a feeble old voice, as he got up to the gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="455" id="dominics.c0.p455"><s>"Hullo, Jeff, is Cripps about?" replied Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="456" id="dominics.c0.p456"><s>"Yas; he be inside or somewheres, maister," replied the old lock-keeper.</s> </p>

<p pid="457" id="dominics.c0.p457"><s>"All right! take the boat up; I want to see Cripps."</s> </p>

<p pid="458" id="dominics.c0.p458" type="speech"><s>Cripps was the son of the old man whom Loman had addressed as Jeff.</s> <s>He was not exactly a gentleman, for he kept the Cockchafer public-house at Maltby, and often served behind the bar in his own person.</s> <s>Neither was he altogether a reputable person, for he frequently helped himself to an overdose of his own beverages, besides being a sharp hand at billiards, and possessing several packs of cards with extra aces in them.</s> <s>Neither was he a particularly refined personage, for his choice of words was often more expressive than romantic, and his ordinary conversation was frequently the reverse of edifying; it mainly had to do with details of the stable or the card-room, and the anecdotes with which he enlivened it were often <qs/>"broader than they were long,"<qe/> to put it mildly.</s> <s>In short, Cripps was a blackguard by practice, whatever he was by profession.</s> <s>He had, however, one redeeming virtue; he was very partial to young gentlemen, and would go a good bit out of his way to meet one.</s> <s>He always managed to know of something that young gentlemen had a fancy for.</s> <s>He could put them into the way of getting a thoroughbred bull-dog dirt-cheap; he could put them up to all the tips at billiards and <qs/>"Nap,"<qe/> and he could make up a book for them on the Derby or any other race, that was bound to win.</s> <s>And he did it all in such a pleasant, frank way that the young gentlemen quite fell in love with him, and entrusted their cash to him with as much confidence as if he were the Bank of England.</s> </p>

<p pid="459" id="dominics.c0.p459"><s>Of all the young gentlemen whose privilege it had been to make the acquaintance of Mr Cripps--and there were a good many--he professed the greatest esteem and admiration for Loman, of Saint Dominic's school, to whom he had been only recently introduced.</s> <s>The two had met at the lock-keeper's house a week ago, when Loman was detained there an hour or two by stress of weather, and, getting into conversation, as gentlemen naturally would, Loman chanced to mention that he wanted to come across a really good fishing-rod.</s> </p>

<p pid="460" id="dominics.c0.p460" type="speech"><s>By a most curious coincidence, Mr Cripps had only the other day been asked by a particular friend of his, who was removing from the country to London--<qs/>"where,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr Cripps, <sse/><qs/>"there ain't over much use for a rod,"<qe/>--if he knew of any one in want of a really good fishing-rod.</s> <s>It was none of your ordinary ones, made out of green wood with pewter joints, but a regular first-class article, and would do for trout or perch or jack, or any mortal fish you could think of.</s> <s>Cripps had seen it, and flattered himself he knew something about rods, but had never seen one to beat this.</s> <s>Reel and all, too, and a book of flies into the bargain, if he liked.</s> <s>He had been strongly tempted to get it for himself--it seemed a downright sin to let such a beauty go--and would have it if he had not already got a rod, but of a far inferior sort, of his own.</s> <s>And he believed his friend would part with it cheap.</s> </p>

<p pid="461" id="dominics.c0.p461" type="speech"><s>"I tell you what, young gentleman," said he, <qs/>"I'll bring it up with me next time I come, and you shall have a look at it.</s> <s>Of course, you can take it or not, as you like, but if my advice is worth anything--well, never mind, I suppose you are sure to be up stream in the course of the next week or so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="462" id="dominics.c0.p462" type="speech"><s>"Oh, yes," said Loman, who in the presence of this universal genius was quite deferential; <qs/>"when can you bring it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="463" id="dominics.c0.p463"><s>"Well, my time ain't so very valuable, and I'd like to oblige you over this little affair.</s> <s>Suppose we say to-day week.</s> <s>I'll have the rod here, and you can try him."</s> </p>

<p pid="464" id="dominics.c0.p464"><s>"Thank you--have you--that is--about what--"</s> </p>

<p pid="465" id="dominics.c0.p465"><s>"You mean, about what figure will he want for it?</s> <s>Well, I don't know exactly.</s> <s>They run so very various, do good rods.</s> <s>You could get what they call a rod for ten bob, I dare say.</s> <s>But _you_ wouldn't hardly fancy that style of thing."</s> </p>

<p pid="466" id="dominics.c0.p466" type="speech"><s>"Oh no; if it was a really good one," said Loman, <qs/>"I wouldn't mind giving a good price.</s> <s>I don't want a rotten one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="467" id="dominics.c0.p467"><s>"That's just it.</s> <s>This one I'm telling you of is as sound as a bell, and as strong as iron.</s> <s>And _you_ know, as well as I do, these things are always all the better after a little use.</s> <s>My friend has only used this twice.</s> <s>But I'll find out about the price, and drop you a line, you know.</s> <s>May be 2 pounds or 3 pounds, or so."</s> </p>

<p pid="468" id="dominics.c0.p468"><s>"I suppose that's about what a really good rod ought to cost?" said Loman, who liked to appear to know what was what, but secretly rather taken aback by this estimate.</s> </p>

<p pid="469" id="dominics.c0.p469"><s>"So it is.</s> <s>It's just a guess of mine though; but I know for _me_ he'll put it as low as he can."</s> </p>

<p pid="470" id="dominics.c0.p470" type="speech"><s>"I'm sure I shall be very much obliged to you," said Loman, <qs/>"if you can manage it for me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="471" id="dominics.c0.p471"><s>"Not at all, young gentleman.</s> <s>I always like to oblige where I can; besides, you would do as much for me, I'll wager.</s> <s>Well, good-day, Mr-- what's your name?"</s> </p>

<p pid="472" id="dominics.c0.p472"><s>"Loman--at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>You'll send me a line, then about the price?"</s> </p>

<p pid="473" id="dominics.c0.p473"><s>"Yes, sir.</s> <s>Good-day, sir."</s> </p>

<p pid="474" id="dominics.c0.p474"><s>But Mr Cripps had forgotten to send the line, and to-day, when Loman, according to arrangement, came up to the lock-keeper's to receive the rod, the keeper of the Cockchafer was most profuse in his apologies.</s> <s>He was most sorry, but his friend had been ill and not able to attend to business.</s> <s>He had been a _trifle_ afraid from what he heard that he was not quite as anxious to part with that rod as formerly.</s> <s>But Cripps had gone over on purpose and seen him, and got his promise that he should have it to-morrow certain, and if Mr Loman would call or send up, it should be ready for him, without fail.</s> </p>

<p pid="475" id="dominics.c0.p475"><s>At this stage, Stephen, having explored the weir, rejoined his schoolfellow, and the two, after partaking of a bottle of ginger-beer at Mr Cripps's urgent request, returned with the stream to Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="476" id="dominics.c0.p476"><s>The result of this delay was to make Loman doubly anxious to secure this famous fishing-rod, on which his heart was set.</s> <s>Next day, however, he had classes all the afternoon, and could not go himself.</s> <s>He therefore determined to send Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="477" id="dominics.c0.p477" type="speech"><s>"I want you to run up to Gusset Weir," said he to his fag, <qs/>"to fetch me a rod the keeper's son is getting for me.</s> <s>Be quick back, will you? and ask him what the price is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="478" id="dominics.c0.p478"><s>So off Stephen trotted, as soon as school was over, in spite of the counter attraction of a Guinea-pig cricket match.</s> <s>When he reached the lock, Cripps had not arrived.</s> </p>

<p pid="479" id="dominics.c0.p479"><s>"He warn't be long, young maister," said old Jeff, who was one of the snivelling order.</s> <s>"Take a seat, do 'ee.</s> <s>Nice to be a young gemm'un, I says--us poor coves as works wery 'ard, we'd like to be young gemm'un too, with lots o' money, and all so comfortable off.</s> <s>Why, young maister, you don't know now what it is to be in want of a shillun.</s> <s>I do!"</s> </p>

<p pid="480" id="dominics.c0.p480"><s>Stephen promptly pulled out one of his five shillings of pocket-money in answer to this appeal, and felt rather ashamed to appear "comfortable off" in the presence of this patriarch.</s> </p>

<p pid="481" id="dominics.c0.p481" type="speech"><s>"Not that I complains o' my lot, young gemm'un," continued old Cripps, pulling his forelock with one hand and pocketing the shilling with the other.</s> <s>"No, I says, the honest working man don't do no good a-grumblin', but when he's got his famerly to feed," [old Cripps was a widower, and his family consisted of the landlord of the Cockchafer], <qs/>"and on'y this here shillin' to do it with--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="482" id="dominics.c0.p482"><s>Stephen was _very_ green.</s> <s>He almost cried at the sight of this destitute, tottering, honest old man, and before the latter could get farther in his lament another shilling was in his palsied old hand, and the grey old forelock was enduring another tug.</s> </p>

<p pid="483" id="dominics.c0.p483"><s>It was well for Stephen that Mr Cripps junior turned up at this juncture, or the entire five shillings might have made its way into the old man's pouch.</s> </p>

<p pid="484" id="dominics.c0.p484"><s>Mr Cripps junior had the rod.</s> <s>He had had a rare job, he said, to get it, for his friend had only yesterday had an offer of 3 pounds 15 shillings, and was all but taking it.</s> <s>However, here it was, and for only 3 pounds 10 shillings tell Mr Loman; such a bargain as he wouldn't often make in his life, and he could get him the fly-book for a sovereign if he liked.</s> <s>And Mr Cripps would charge him nothing for his trouble.</s> </p>

<p pid="485" id="dominics.c0.p485"><s>After this Mr Cripps junior and the boy got quite friendly.</s> <s>The former was greatly interested in hearing about Saint Dominic's, especially when he understood Stephen was a new boy.</s> <s>Cripps could remember the day when _he_ was a new boy, and had to fight three boys in three hours the first afternoon.</s> <s>He was awfully fond of cricket when he was a boy.</s> <s>Was Stephen?</s> </p>

<p pid="486" id="dominics.c0.p486" type="speech"><s>"Oh, yes," said Stephen; <qs/>"I like it more than anything."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="487" id="dominics.c0.p487"><s>"Ah, you should have seen the way we played.</s> <s>Bless me!</s> <s>I'd a bat, my boy, that could tip the balls clean over the school-house.</s> <s>You've got a bat, of course, or else--"</s> </p>

<p pid="488" id="dominics.c0.p488"><s>"No, I haven't," said Stephen.</s> <s>"I shall get one as soon as I can."</s> </p>

<p pid="489" id="dominics.c0.p489" type="speech"><s>"Well, that _is_ lucky!</s> <s>Look here, young gentleman," continued Cripps confidentially; <qs/>"I've taken a fancy to you.</s> <s>It's best to be plain and speak out.</s> <s>I've taken a fancy to you, and you shall have that bat.</s> <s>It's just your size, and the finest bit of willow you ever set eyes on.</s> <s>I'll wager you'll make top score every time you use it.</s> <s>You shall have it.</s> <s>Never mind about the stumpy--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="490" id="dominics.c0.p490" type="speech"><s>"Stumpy!" ejaculated Stephen; <qs/>"I don't want stumps, only a bat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="516" id="dominics.c0.p516"><s>"Mr R-g-h opened in the negative.</s> <s>He denied all the charges made by the young gentleman who had last spoken.</s> <s>He undertook to get up an eleven to beat any eleven the Tadpoles could put into the field; and as to intellect, why, didn't the Tadpoles, some of them, get their sums done by the Sixth?</s> <s>Besides, even if their intellect was weak, couldn't they use cribs?</s> <s>He didn't use them himself, but he knew one or two who did.</s> <s>He didn't understand the objection to the hair-oil; he used it to make the hair sit down on his head.</s> <s>[Raleigh, it should be said, had a most irrepressible bunch of curls on his head.]  He wore kid gloves on Sunday because he had had a pair given him by his great-aunt Jane Ann.</s> <s>He maintained the Sixth was not degenerate.</s> </p>

<p pid="517" id="dominics.c0.p517"><s>"Mr L-m-n followed on the same side.</s> <s>He thought it the greatest liberty of any one to discuss the Sixth.</s> <s>He was a Sixth Form fellow, and a monitor, and if he wasn't looked up to he ought to be, and he intended to be.</s> <s>He was in the cricket eleven, and he was intellectual-- very, very much so.</s> <s>He was going in for the Nightingale Scholarship, and had no doubt in his own mind as to the result.</s> <s>He hardly understood his friend's reference to Maltby.</s> <s>Why shouldn't he go there and take his fag too if he chose?</s> <s>He didn't see what right the Fifth had to fags at all.</s> <s>He had a fag, but then he was in the Sixth.</s> <s>His fag admired him, and he never told him not to.</s> <s>The Sixth _could not_ be degenerate so long as _he_ was in it."</s> </p>

<p pid="518" id="dominics.c0.p518"><s>"Other speakers followed, including Mr W-r-n, who maintained that Michael Angelo was a greater musician than Queen Anne.</s> <s>He was here called to order, and reminded that Michael Angelo had nothing to do with the degeneracy of the Sixth.</s> <s>He begged leave to explain--</s> </p>

<p pid="519" id="dominics.c0.p519"><s>"At this point our reporter fell asleep."</s> </p>

<p pid="520" id="dominics.c0.p520"><s>The laughter which greeted the reading of this extract was by no means shared by the Sixth Form boys present, who, had the next selection been in a similar strain, would have quitted the scene and taken their chance of satisfying their curiosity as to the rest of the contents of the paper at a more convenient season.</s> </p>

<p pid="521" id="dominics.c0.p521" type="speech"><s>But the next lucubration was the unfortunate Stephen's examination paper, with the answers thereto embellished, and in many cases bodily supplied, by the fertile Anthony.</s> <s>The luckless Stephen, who was wedged up in the front row of readers, could have sunk into the earth on meeting once more that hateful paper face to face, and feeling himself an object of ridicule to the whole school.</s> <s>For the wonderful answers which now appeared were hardly any of them his own composition, and he did not even get credit for the few correct things he had said.</s> <s>Shouts of laughter greeted the reading, during which he dared not lift his eyes from the ground.</s> <s>But the answer to Question 6, <qs/>"What is a minus?"<qe/> was more than human flesh and blood could endure.</s> </p>

<p pid="522" id="dominics.c0.p522"><s>"What is a Minus?"</s> </p>

<p pid="523" id="dominics.c0.p523"><s>"`Minus' is derived from two English words, `my,' meaning my, and `nus,' which is the London way of pronouncing `nurse.'</s> <s>My nurse is a dear creature; I love her still, especially now she doesn't wash my face.</s> <s>I hated having my face washed.</s> <s>My nurse's name is Mrs Blake, but I always call her my own Noodle-oodle-oo.</s> <s>I do love her so!</s> <s>How I would like to hug her!</s> <s>She sewed the strings of my little flannel vest on in front just before I came here because she knew I couldn't tie them behind by myself--"</s> </p>

<p pid="524" id="dominics.c0.p524"><s>"She didn't!" shouted Stephen, in a voice trembling with indignation.</s> </p>

<p pid="525" id="dominics.c0.p525"><s>Poor boy!</s> <s>The laughter which greeted this simple exclamation was enough to finish up any one, and, with a bursting heart, and a face crimson with confusion, he struggled out of the crowd and ran as fast as his legs would take him to his own class-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="526" id="dominics.c0.p526" type="speech"><s>But if he imagined in his misery that the whole school was going to spend the entire day jeering at him, and him alone, he was greatly mistaken, for once out of sight Stephen soon passed out of mind in presence of the next elegant extract read out for the benefit of the assembled audience.</s> <s>This was no other than Simon's <qs/>"Love-Ballad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="527" id="dominics.c0.p527"><s>Simon, it should be known, was one of the dullest boys in Saint Dominic's, and it was a standing marvel how he ever came to be in the Fifth, for he was both a dunce and an idiot.</s> <s>But he had one ambition and one idea, which was that he could write poetry; and the following touching ballad from his pen he offered to the _Dominican_, and the _Dominican_ showed its appreciation of real talent by inserting it:--</s> </p>

<p pid="528" id="dominics.c0.p528"><s>"A Love-Ballad.</s> </p>

<p pid="529" id="dominics.c0.p529"><s>"I wish I was a buttercup, Upon the mountain top, That you might sweetly pick me up, And sweetly let me drop.</s> <s>I wish I was a little worm, All rigling in the sun, That I myself towards thee might turn When thou along didst come.</s> <s>Oh, I wish I was a doormat, sweet, All prostrate on the floor, If only thou wouldst wipe thy feet, On me, what could I want more?"</s> </p>

<p pid="530" id="dominics.c0.p530"><s>["Rigling" is possibly "wriggling".]</s> </p>

<p pid="531" id="dominics.c0.p531"><s>Simon, who, with true poet's instinct, was standing among the crowd listening to his own poem, was somewhat perplexed by the manner in which his masterpiece was received.</s> <s>That every one was delighted there could be no doubt.</s> <s>But he had an impression he had meant the ballad to be pathetic.</s> <s>Saint Dominic's, however, had taken it up another way, and appeared to regard it as facetious.</s> <s>At any rate his fame was made, and looking as if a laurel wreath already encircled his brow, he modestly retired, feeling no further interest, now his own piece was ended.</s> </p>

<p pid="532" id="dominics.c0.p532" type="speech"><s>Oliver's poem on the Tadpoles, with its marvellous rhymes, fell comparatively flat after this; and Bullinger's first chapter of the History of Saint Dominic's failed to rivet the attention of the audience, which, however, became suddenly and painfully absorbed in the <qs/>"Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse,"<qe/> from the pen of Wraysford.</s> <s>We must inflict a few passages from this document on the reader, as the paper was the cause of some trouble hereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="533" id="dominics.c0.p533"><s>"Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse.</s> </p>

<p pid="534" id="dominics.c0.p534"><s>"Monday.--Up early and took a good breakfast in one of the desks where there was a jam sandwich and several toffee-drops.</s> <s>The Sixth seem to like jam sandwiches and toffee-drops, there are some of them in nearly every desk.</s> <s>The desk I was in had a packet of cigarettes in one corner.</s> <s>They were labelled `Mild.'</s> <s>I wonder why the Sixth like their cigarettes mild.</s> <s>In the same desk were one or two books written by a man called Bohn; they seemed queer books, for they had Latin and Greek names outside, but all the reading inside was English.</s> <s>It is sad to see the quarrelling that goes on in this room.</s> <s>You would not suppose, to see these monitors walking grandly up and down the passages striking terror into the hearts of all the small boys, that they could possibly condescend to quarrel over the possession of an inkpot or the ownership of an acid-drop found among the cinders.</s> <s>Alas! it is very sad.</s> <s>They don't seem anything like the Sixth of old days.</s> <s>I shall emigrate if this goes on.</s> </p>

<p pid="535" id="dominics.c0.p535"><s>"Wednesday.--A great row to-day when the Doctor was out of the room.</s> <s>The two senior monitors engaged in a game of marbles--knuckle down--in the course of which one player accused the other of cheating.</s> <s>There was nearly a fight, only neither seemed exactly to like to begin, and both appeared relieved when the Doctor came in and confiscated the marbles."</s> </p>

<p pid="536" id="dominics.c0.p536"><s>And so the diary went on, in a strain highly offensive to the Sixth and equally delighting to the lower forms.</s> <s>After this the Sixth withdrew, not caring to face further taunts of the kind, and leaving a free field to the rest of Saint Dominic's, who perused this wonderful broadside to the end with unflagging interest.</s> <s>Some of the advertisements with which Tony had filled up the gaps caused considerable mirth--such as this:</s> <s>"A gentleman about to clear out his desk, begs to give notice that he will Sell by Auction to-morrow after `Lights out,' all those rare and valuable articles, to wit:--one and a half gross best cherry-stones, last year's, in excellent condition.</s> <s>About twelve assorted bread crusts, warranted dry and hard--one with a covering of fossilised sardine.</s> <s>Six quires of valuable manuscript notes on various subjects, comprising Latin, Greek, Mathematics, French, and Crambo.</s> <s>One apple, well seasoned, and embellished with a brilliant green fur of two years' growth.</s> <s>And many other miscellaneous treasures, such as slate pencils, nutshells, an antique necktie, several defunct silkworms, a noble three-bladed knife (deficient of the blades), and half a pound of putty.</s> <s>No reserve price.</s> <s>Must be cleared out at whatever sacrifice."</s> </p>

<p pid="537" id="dominics.c0.p537"><s>And this was another:--</s> </p>

<p pid="538" id="dominics.c0.p538"><s>"This is to give notice, that whereas certain parties calling themselves Guinea-pigs have infringed on our patent rights, we, the Tadpoles of Saint Dominic's, have been and are from time immemorial entitled to the exclusive privilege of appearing in public with dirty faces, uncombed hair, and inky fingers.</s> <s>We have also the sole right of making beasts of ourselves on every possible occasion; and we hereby declare that it is our intention to institute proceedings against all parties, of whatever name, who shall hereafter trespass on these our inalienable rights.</s> <s>By order, B. Smudgeface and T. Blacknose, Secretaries."</s> </p>

<p pid="539" id="dominics.c0.p539"><s>This final onslaught broke up the party.</s> <s>The aggrieved Tadpoles rushed to their quarters and fumed and raged themselves into a state bordering on, madness; and vowed revenge till they were hoarse.</s> </p>

<p pid="540" id="dominics.c0.p540"><s>It was a curious fact, nevertheless, that at prayers that evening there were more clean faces among the Tadpoles than had been seen there since the formation of that ancient and honourable fraternity.</s> </p>

<p pid="541" id="dominics.c0.p541"><s>CHAPTER EIGHT.</s> <s>A QUARREL AND A CRICKET MATCH.</s> </p>

<p pid="542" id="dominics.c0.p542"><s>The first number of the _Dominican_ had undoubtedly caused a sensation; and it would have created far more sensation but for the fact that the Alphabet Match was to be played on the following day.</s> <s>But even this counter-attraction could not wholly divert the mind of Saint Dominic's from this new literary marvel; and a skirmish took place on the very afternoon of its appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="543" id="dominics.c0.p543"><s>Pembury and his friends had quite expected that the Sixth would attempt a high-handed blow at their paper, and they were not disappointed.</s> <s>For no sooner had Loman and his peers stalked away from the scene of their indignation, and found themselves in the retirement of their own room, than they fell to talking in terms the reverse of pleasant about the event of the morning.</s> <s>The least important of their number was specially wroth.</s> </p>

<p pid="544" id="dominics.c0.p544" type="speech"><s>"There's a great row out in the passage to-day," said Raleigh, who was blissfully ignorant of the whole matter; <qs/>"why can't some of you monitors keep a little better order?</s> <s>The Doctor will be wanting to know what it's all about!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="545" id="dominics.c0.p545" type="speech"><s>"All very well," said Raikes, one of the monitors; <qs/>"but if the Fifth will stick their tomfoolery out in the passage, there's sure to be a row."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="546" id="dominics.c0.p546"><s>"What tomfoolery?</s> <s>Some of you are for ever grumbling at the Fifth."</s> </p>

<p pid="547" id="dominics.c0.p547"><s>"And so would you if you saw the complimentary remarks they make about you in this precious newspaper of theirs."</s> </p>

<p pid="548" id="dominics.c0.p548"><s>"Oh, the _Dominican_?</s> <s>I must have a look at it by and by; but meanwhile something had better be done to stop that row, or we shall catch it ourselves."</s> </p>

<p pid="549" id="dominics.c0.p549"><s>And so saying, the captain left these injured youths to their own counsels, which it is to be feared were moved more by dislike for the _Dominican_ than by a burning desire for the good order of the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="550" id="dominics.c0.p550"><s>However, they must do something; and there would be nothing inconsistent with their dignity in demanding the withdrawal of the obnoxious broadside on account of the noise it caused.</s> <s>This would be a safe move, and might be checkmate.</s> <s>Loman was deputed to wait upon the Fifth with the demand of the monitors, and lost no time in carrying out this welcome task.</s> <s>Class was just over, and the Fifth were just about to clear out of their room when Loman entered.</s> <s>It was not often that a Sixth Form fellow penetrated into their camp, and had they not guessed his mission they might have resented the intrusion.</s> </p>

<p pid="551" id="dominics.c0.p551" type="speech"><s>"Oh, you fellows," began Loman, feeling not quite so confident now as he had felt five minutes ago, <qs/>"we can't have that thing of yours hanging out in the passage like that.</s> <s>It makes a crowd--too much row.</s> <s>Whose is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="552" id="dominics.c0.p552" type="speech"><s>"Not mine," said Wraysford, laughing; <qs/>"ask Bully--perhaps it's his."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="553" id="dominics.c0.p553" type="speech"><s>"Not a bit of it," said Bullinger; <qs/>"it's yours, isn't it, Simon?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="554" id="dominics.c0.p554" type="speech"><s>"Only part," said the poet of the "Love-Ballad", <qs/>"and I presented that to the paper."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="555" id="dominics.c0.p555"><s>"Suppose it was mine?" said Oliver, with a drawl.</s> </p>

<p pid="556" id="dominics.c0.p556" type="speech"><s>"Then," said Loman, losing his temper, <qs/>"all I can say is, the sooner you clear it away the better."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="557" id="dominics.c0.p557"><s>"Oh! all right; only it's not mine."</s> </p>

<p pid="558" id="dominics.c0.p558" type="speech"><s>"Look here," said Loman, <qs/>"I'm not going to fool about with you.</s> <s>You may think it all very funny, but I'll report it to the Doctor, and then you'll look foolish."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="559" id="dominics.c0.p559"><s>"How nice!</s> <s>So pleasant it will be to look for once like what you look always," observed Pembury, gnawing the top of his crutch.</s> </p>

<p pid="560" id="dominics.c0.p560"><s>At that moment there was a loud shout of laughter in the passage outside, confirming the monitor's complaint.</s> <s>Wraysford walked hastily to the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="561" id="dominics.c0.p561" type="speech"><s>"The next time there's a row like that outside our door," called he to the group outside, <qs/>"we'll--what do you mean by it, you young blackguard?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="562" id="dominics.c0.p562"><s>So saying, he caught Master Bramble, who happened to be the nearest offender within reach, by the collar of his coat, and lugged him bodily into the class-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="563" id="dominics.c0.p563"><s>"There, now!</s> <s>Do you know this gentleman?</s> <s>He's a monitor.</s> <s>Have a good look at him.</s> <s>He's been complaining of the row you are making, and quite rightly.</s> <s>Take that, and tell all the little Pigs outside that if they don't hold their noise they will find themselves, every man jack of them, _mentioned by name_ in the next number!"</s> </p>

<p pid="564" id="dominics.c0.p564"><s>So saying, with a gentle cuff he handed the ill-starred Master Bramble out again to his fellows, and from that time there was scarcely a sound audible from the passage.</s> </p>

<p pid="565" id="dominics.c0.p565"><s>"Good-bye," said Pembury, kissing his hand to Loman, who all this time had been standing in the middle of the room, in a white heat, and perplexed what to do or say next.</s> </p>

<p pid="566" id="dominics.c0.p566"><s>"You aren't going to live here, are you?" asked Bullinger.</s> </p>

<p pid="567" id="dominics.c0.p567"><s>"Any one got a toffee-drop?" drily inquired Oliver.</s> <s>To his surprise, and to the surprise of every one, Loman wheeled round towards the last speaker, and without a word struck him a blow on the mouth with his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="568" id="dominics.c0.p568" type="speech"><s>He saw he had made a mistake, and looked ashamed the moment the deed was done.</s> <s>All eyes turned to Oliver, whose face was crimson with a sudden flush of pain and anger.</s> <s>He sprang to his feet, and Braddy, the bully, was already beginning to gloat over the prospect of a fight, when, to every one's amazement, Oliver coolly put his hands back into his pockets, and walking up to Loman said, quietly, <qs/>"Hadn't you better go?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="569" id="dominics.c0.p569"><s>Loman stared at him in astonishment.</s> <s>He had at least expected to be knocked down, and this, behaviour was quite incomprehensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="570" id="dominics.c0.p570"><s>He turned on his heel and quitted the room without a word; and somehow or other from that time the Fifth heard no more protests from the monitors on the subject of the _Dominican_.</s> </p>

<p pid="571" id="dominics.c0.p571"><s>But Oliver's conduct, much as it had astonished the person chiefly concerned, had astonished the Fifth still more.</s> <s>For the first time in the history of their class, as far as they could recollect, a blow struck had not been returned, and they could not tell what to make of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="572" id="dominics.c0.p572" type="speech"><s>The blow had been a cowardly one, and certainly unmerited, and by all schoolboy tradition one fairly demanding a return.</s> <s>Could it be possible their man was lacking in courage?</s> <s>The idea was a shock to most present, who, although Oliver was never very popular among them, as has been said, had never before suspected his pluck.</s> <s>In fact, it was an awkward moment for all, and it was quite a relief when Simon broke silence by asking Oliver, <qs/>"Why didn't you knock him down, I say?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="573" id="dominics.c0.p573"><s>"Because I did not choose, if you want to know," replied Oliver, shortly.</s> </p>

<p pid="574" id="dominics.c0.p574"><s>"Oh!</s> <s>I beg your pardon," replied Simon, rather taken aback by this brusque answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="575" id="dominics.c0.p575"><s>This was not satisfactory.</s> <s>Had the offender been a Guinea-pig, one could have understood the thing; but when it was a Sixth Form fellow--a good match in every respect, as well as a rival--the Fifth were offended at their man for drawing back as he had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="576" id="dominics.c0.p576"><s>"I suppose you _will_ fight him?" said Ricketts, in a voice which implied that there was no doubt about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="577" id="dominics.c0.p577"><s>"Do you?" replied Oliver, briefly.</s> </p>

<p pid="578" id="dominics.c0.p578"><s>The boy's manner was certainly not winsome, and, when once put out, it was evident he took no trouble to conceal the fact.</s> <s>He refused to answer any further questions on the subject, and presently quitted the room, leaving more than half his class-fellows convinced that, after all, he _was_ a coward.</s> </p>

<p pid="579" id="dominics.c0.p579"><s>An angry discussion followed his departure.</s> </p>

<p pid="580" id="dominics.c0.p580"><s>"He ought to be made to fight, whether he likes or not," said Braddy the bully.</s> </p>

<p pid="581" id="dominics.c0.p581" type="speech"><s>"Some one ought to pay Loman out," suggested Ricketts, <qs/>"if Greenfield doesn't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="582" id="dominics.c0.p582" type="speech"><s>"A nice name we shall get, all of us," said Bullinger, <qs/>"when it gets abroad all over the school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="583" id="dominics.c0.p583"><s>"It's a shame, because one fellow funks, for the whole Form to be disgraced; that's what I say," said some one else.</s> </p>

<p pid="584" id="dominics.c0.p584"><s>There were, however, two boys who did not join in this general cry of indignation against Oliver, and they were Wraysford and Pembury.</s> <s>The latter was always whimsical in his opinions, and no one was surprised to see him come out on the wrong side.</s> <s>As for Wraysford, he always backed his friend up, whether others thought him right or wrong.</s> <s>These two scouted the idea of Oliver being a coward; the one with his usual weapon of ridicule, the other with all the warmth of friendship.</s> </p>

<p pid="585" id="dominics.c0.p585"><s>"Who calls him a coward?" exclaimed Wraysford, glaring at the last speaker.</s> </p>

<p pid="586" id="dominics.c0.p586"><s>Wraysford was not a coward, and looked so ready to avenge his friend by hard knocks, that the boy who had insinuated that Greenfield was afraid withdrew his charge as mildly as he could.</s> <s>"I only meant, it looks as if he didn't like to fight," he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="587" id="dominics.c0.p587"><s>"And what business of yours is it what it looks like?" demanded Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="588" id="dominics.c0.p588" type="speech"><s>"Come, old man," said Pembury; <qs/>"don't eat him up!</s> <s>I fancy Greenfield might screw up courage to pull _his_ nose, whoever else he lets off, eh?</s> <s>It's my private opinion, though, Oliver knew what he was about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="589" id="dominics.c0.p589" type="speech"><s>"Of course he did," sneered Braddy; <qs/>"he knew jolly well what he was about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="590" id="dominics.c0.p590"><s>"Dear me!</s> <s>Is that you, Mr Braddy?</s> <s>I had not noticed you here, or I should not have ventured to speak on a matter having to do with pluck and heroism.</s> <s>I'm glad you agree with me, though, although I didn't say he knew _jolly_ well what he was about.</s> <s>That is an expression of your own."</s> </p>

<p pid="591" id="dominics.c0.p591"><s>Braddy, who as usual felt and looked extinguished when Pembury made fun of him, retired sulkily, and the editor of the _Dominican_ thereupon turned his attack on another quarter.</s> <s>And so the dispute went on, neither party being convinced, and all satisfied only on one point--that a cloud had arisen to mar the hitherto peaceful horizon of Fifth Form existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="592" id="dominics.c0.p592"><s>The cricket match of the following day, however, served to divert the thoughts of all parties for a time.</s> </p>

<p pid="593" id="dominics.c0.p593"><s>As it was only the prelude to a much more important match shortly to follow, I shall not attempt to describe it fully here, as the reader will probably be far more interested in the incidents of Sixth versus School Match when it comes off.</s> </p>

<p pid="594" id="dominics.c0.p594" type="speech"><s>The Alphabet Match was, to tell the truth, not nearly as interesting an affair as it promised to be, for from the very first the N's to Z's had the best of it.</s> <s>Stephen, who with a company of fellow-Tadpoles and Guinea-pigs was perched on the palings, looking on, felt his heart sink within him as first one and then another of his brother's side lost their wickets without runs.</s> <s>For once he and Bramble were in sympathy, and he and Paul were at difference.</s> <s>The row these small boys kicked up, by the way, was one of the most notable features of the whole match.</s> <s>Every one of them yelled for his own side.</s> <s>There had, indeed, been a question whether every Guinea-pig, whatever his private initial, ought not to yell for the G's, and every Tadpole for the T's; but it was eventually decided that each should yell <qs/>"on his own hook,"<qe/> and the effect was certainly far more diverting.</s> </p>

<p pid="595" id="dominics.c0.p595"><s>The first four men of the A to M went out for two runs between them, and Stephen and Bramble sat in gloomy despair.</s> <s>The next man in knocked down his wicket before he had played a single ball.</s> <s>It was frightful, and the jeers of the Z's were hateful to hear.</s> </p>

<p pid="596" id="dominics.c0.p596"><s>But Stephen brightened as he perceived that the next batsman was his brother.</s> <s>"Now they'll pick up!" said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="597" id="dominics.c0.p597"><s>"No they won't!</s> <s>Greenfield senior skies his balls too much for my taste," cheeringly replied the small Bramble.</s> </p>

<p pid="598" id="dominics.c0.p598"><s>But Stephen was right.</s> <s>For the first time that afternoon the A's made a stand.</s> <s>Oliver's partner at the wickets was Callonby, of the Sixth, a steady, plodding player, who hardly ever hit out, and got all his runs (if he got any) from the slips.</s> <s>This afternoon he hardly scored at all, but kept his wicket carefully while Oliver did the hitting.</s> </p>

<p pid="599" id="dominics.c0.p599"><s>Things were looking up.</s> <s>The telegraph went up from 2 to 20.</s> <s>Wraysford, who had hitherto been bowling with Ricketts against his friend, gave up the ball to Raikes, and the field generally woke up to the importance of getting rid of this daring player.</s> </p>

<p pid="600" id="dominics.c0.p600"><s>Stephen's throat was too hoarse to roar any more, so he resigned that duty to Bramble, and looked on in delighted silence.</s> <s>The score crept up, till suddenly Callonby tipped a ball into cover-slip's hand and was caught, to the great delight of the Z's, who guessed that, once a separation had been effected, the survivor would soon be disposed of.</s> </p>

<p pid="601" id="dominics.c0.p601"><s>The next man in was Loman.</s> <s>He was better as a bowler than a batsman; but he followed Callonby's tactics and played a steady block, leaving the boy he had struck yesterday to do the hitting.</s> </p>

<p pid="602" id="dominics.c0.p602"><s>Oliver was certainly playing in fine form, and for a moment his class-fellows forgot their resentment against him in applauding his play.</s> <s>The score was at 35, and the new coalition promised to be as formidable as the last, when Oliver cut a ball past point.</s> </p>

<p pid="603" id="dominics.c0.p603" type="speech"><s>"Run! no! yes, run!" he shouted.</s> <s>Loman started, then hesitated, then started again--but it was too late.</s> <s>Before he could get across, the ball was up and he was run out.</s> <s>He was furious, and it certainly was hard lines for him, although there would have been time enough for the run had he not pulled up in the middle.</s> <s>Forgetful of all the rules of cricket, he turned round to Oliver and shouted, <qs/>"You are a fool!"<qe/> as he left the wicket.</s> </p>

<p pid="604" id="dominics.c0.p604"><s>Stephen luckily was too much engrossed in watching the telegraph to hear or notice this remark; which, however, was not lost on the Fifth generally, who experienced a return of their former discontent when they observed that Oliver (though he must have heard it) took not the slightest notice of the offensive expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="605" id="dominics.c0.p605"><s>The match passed off without further incident.</s> <s>The Z's won in the end by two wickets, after a closer match than it had promised to be at first, and Stephen was comforted for the reverse by feeling sure that his brother at any rate had played his best, and would certainly get his place in the School Eleven.</s> </p>

<p pid="606" id="dominics.c0.p606"><s>CHAPTER NINE.</s> <s>A ROD IN PICKLE.</s> </p>

<p pid="607" id="dominics.c0.p607"><s>Loman, who had arrived at the same conclusion respecting Oliver's bravery as the majority in the Fifth, did not allow his conscience to trouble him as to his share of the morning's business.</s> <s>He never had liked Oliver, and lately especially he had come to dislike him.</s> <s>He was therefore glad to have made him smart; and now, since the blunder in the cricket match, he felt greatly inclined to repeat the blow, particularly as there did not seem much to fear if he did so.</s> </p>

<p pid="608" id="dominics.c0.p608"><s>He was quick, too, to see that Oliver had lost favour with his comrades, and had no hesitation in availing himself of every opportunity of widening the breach.</s> <s>He affected to be sorry for the poor fellow, and to feel that he had been too hard on him, and so on, in a manner which, while it offended the Fifth, as applied to one of their set, exasperated them all the more against Oliver.</s> <s>And so matters went on, getting more and more unsatisfactory.</s> </p>

<p pid="609" id="dominics.c0.p609" type="speech"><s>Loman, however, had other things to think of than his rival's cowardice, and foremost among these was his new fishing-rod--or rather, the rod which he coveted for his own.</s> <s>Until the day after the Alphabet Match he had not even had time to examine his treasure.</s> <s>Three pounds ten was an appalling figure to pay for a rod; <qs/>"But then,"<qe/><sss/> thought Loman, <sse/><qs/>"if it's really a good one, and worth half as much again, it would be a pity to miss such a bargain;"<qe/> and every one knew the Crippses, father and son, were authorities on all matters pertaining to the piscatorial art.</s> <s>Loman, too, was never badly off for pocket-money, and could easily raise the amount, he felt sure, when he represented the case at home.</s> <s>So he took the rod out of its canvas bag, and began to put it together.</s> </p>

<p pid="610" id="dominics.c0.p610"><s>Now, a boy's study is hardly the place in which to flourish a fishing-rod, and Loman found that with the butt down in one bottom corner of the room, the top joint would have to be put on up in the opposite top corner.</s> <s>When this complicated operation was over, there was no room to move it from its position, still less to judge of its weight and spring, or attach the winch and line.</s> <s>Happy thought! the window!</s> <s>He would have any amount of scope there.</s> <s>So, taking it to pieces, and putting it together again in this new direction, he had the satisfaction of testing it at its full length.</s> <s>He was pleased with the rod, on the whole.</s> <s>He attached the line, with a fly at the end, in order to give it a thorough trial, and gave a scientific "cast" into an imaginary pool.</s> <s>It was a splendid rod, just right for him; how he wished he was up above Gusset Weir at that moment!</s> <s>Why, he could--</s> </p>

<p pid="611" id="dominics.c0.p611"><s>Here he attempted to draw up the rod.</s> <s>There was an ugly tug and a crack as he did so, and he found, to his disgust, that the hook, having nothing else to catch, had caught the ivy on the wall, and, what was worse, that the top joint of the rod had either snapped or cracked in its inability to bring this weighty catch to shore.</s> <s>It was a long time before Loman was able to disengage his line, and bring the rod in again at the window.</s> <s>The top joint was cracked.</s> <s>It looked all right as he held it, but when he tried to bend it it had lost its spring, and the crack showed only too plainly.</s> <s>Another misfortune still was in store.</s> <s>The reel in winding up suddenly stuck.</s> <s>Loman, fancying it had only caught temporarily, tried to force it, and in so doing the spring broke, and the handle turned uselessly round and round in his hand.</s> <s>This _was_ a streak of bad luck, and no mistake!</s> <s>The rod was not his, and what was worse, it was (so Cripps said) a rod of extraordinary excellence and value.</s> <s>Loman had his doubts now about this.</s> <s>A first-rate top-piece would bend nearly double and then not break, and a reel that broke at the least pressure could hardly be of the best kind.</s> <s>Still, Cripps thought a lot of it, and Loman had undoubtedly himself alone to blame for the accidents which had occurred.</s> <s>As it was, the rod was now useless.</s> <s>He knew there was no place in Maltby where he could get it repaired, and it was hardly to be expected that Cripps would take it back.</s> </p>

<p pid="612" id="dominics.c0.p612"><s>What was to be done?</s> <s>Either he must pay 3 pounds 10 shillings for a rod of no value, or--</s> </p>

<p pid="613" id="dominics.c0.p613"><s>He slowly took the rod to pieces and put it back into the canvas bag.</s> <s>The top joint after all did not look amiss; and, yes, there was a _little_ bit of elasticity in it.</s> <s>Perhaps the crack was only his fancy; or perhaps the crack was there when he got it.</s> <s>As to the reel, it looked as if it _ought_ to work, and perhaps it would if he only knew the way.</s> <s>Ah! suppose he just sent the rod back to Cripps with a message that he found he did not require it?</s> <s>He would not say he had not used it, but if Cripps chose to imagine he received it back just as he sent it, well, what harm?</s> <s>Cripps would be sure to sell it to some one else, or else put it by (he had said he possessed a rod of his own).</s> <s>If he, Loman, had felt quite certain that he had damaged the rod himself, of course he would not think of such a thing; but he was not at all certain the thing was not defective to begin with.</s> <s>In any case it was an inferior rod--that he had no doubt about--and Cripps was not acting honestly by trying to pass it off on him as one of the best make.</s> <s>Yes, it would serve Cripps right, and be a lesson to him, and he was sure, yes, quite sure now, it had been damaged to begin with.</s> </p>

<p pid="614" id="dominics.c0.p614"><s>And so the boy argued with himself and coquetted with the tempter.</s> <s>Before the afternoon was over he felt (as he imagined) quite comfortable in his own mind over the affair.</s> <s>The rod was tied up again in its bag exactly as it had been before, and only wanted an opportunity to be returned to Mr Cripps.</s> </p>

<p pid="615" id="dominics.c0.p615"><s>After that Loman settled down to an evening's study.</s> <s>But things were against him again.</s> <s>Comfortable as his conscience was, that top joint would not let him alone.</s> <s>It seemed to get into his hand in place of the pen, and to point out the words in the lexicon in place of his finger.</s> <s>He tried not to mind it, but it annoyed him, and, what was worse, interfered with his work.</s> <s>So, shutting up his books, and imagining a change of air might be beneficial, he went off to Callonby's study, there to gossip for an hour or two, and finally rid himself of his tormentor.</s> </p>

<p pid="616" id="dominics.c0.p616" type="speech"><s>Stephen, meanwhile, had had Mr Cripps on his mind too, for that afternoon his bat had come home.</s> <s>It was addressed to <qs/>"Mr Greenfield, Saint Dominic's,"<qe/> and of course taken to Oliver, who wondered much to receive a small size cricket-bat in a parcel.</s> <s>Master Paul, however, who was in attendance, was able to clear up the mystery.</s> </p>

<p pid="617" id="dominics.c0.p617"><s>"Oh! that's your young brother's, I expect; he said he had got a bat coming."</s> </p>

<p pid="618" id="dominics.c0.p618"><s>"All I can say is, he must be more flush of cash than I am, to go in for a thing like this.</s> <s>Send him here, Paul."</s> </p>

<p pid="619" id="dominics.c0.p619"><s>So Paul vanished, and presently Stephen put in an appearance, blushing, and anxious-looking.</s> </p>

<p pid="624" id="dominics.c0.p624"><s>"Nothing out of the way.</s> <s>But, I say, young 'un, how much have you given for it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="625" id="dominics.c0.p625"><s>"Not anything yet.</s> <s>Mr Cripps said I could pay in June, when I get my next pocket-money."</s> </p>

<p pid="626" id="dominics.c0.p626"><s>"What on earth has he to do with when you get your pocket-money?" demanded Oliver.</s> <s>"Who is this young Cripps?</s> <s>He's a cad, isn't he?"</s> </p>

<p pid="627" id="dominics.c0.p627"><s>"He seemed a very nice man," said Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="628" id="dominics.c0.p628"><s>"Well, look here! the less you have to do with men like him the better.</s> <s>What is the price of the bat?"</s> </p>

<p pid="630" id="dominics.c0.p630" type="speech"><s>"You young muff!" said the elder brother; <qs/>"I expect the fellow's swindling you.</s> <s>Find out what he wants for it at once, and pay him; I'm not going to let you run into debt."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="631" id="dominics.c0.p631"><s>"But I can't; I've only two shillings left," said Stephen, dejectedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="632" id="dominics.c0.p632"><s>"Why, whatever have you done with the five shillings you had last week?"</s> </p>

<p pid="633" id="dominics.c0.p633" type="speech"><s>Stephen blushed, and then faltered, <qs/>"I spent sixpence on stamps and sixpence on--on brandy-balls!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="634" id="dominics.c0.p634"><s>"I thought so.</s> <s>And what did you do with the rest?"</s> </p>

<p pid="635" id="dominics.c0.p635"><s>"Oh!</s> <s>I--I--that is--I--gave them away."</s> </p>

<p pid="636" id="dominics.c0.p636"><s>"Gave them away!</s> <s>Who to--to Bramble?"</s> </p>

<p pid="637" id="dominics.c0.p637" type="speech"><s>"No," said Stephen, laughing at the idea; <qs/>"I gave them to a poor old man!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="638" id="dominics.c0.p638"><s>"Where?--when?</s> <s>Upon my word, Stephen, you _are_ a jackass--who to?"</s> </p>

<p pid="639" id="dominics.c0.p639"><s>And then Stephen confessed, and the elder brother rated him soundly for his folly, till the little fellow felt quite miserable and ashamed of himself.</s> <s>In the end, Oliver insisted on Stephen finding out at once what the price of the bat was, and promised he would lend his brother the money for it.</s> <s>In return for this, Stephen promised to make no more purchases of this kind without first consulting Oliver, and at this juncture Wraysford turned up, and Stephen beat a retreat with his bat over his shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="640" id="dominics.c0.p640"><s>The two friends had not been alone together since _the fracas_ in the Fifth two days before, and both now appeared glad of an opportunity of talking over that and subsequent events.</s> </p>

<p pid="641" id="dominics.c0.p641"><s>"I suppose you know a lot of the fellows are very sore at you for not thrashing Loman?" said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="647" id="dominics.c0.p647"><s>"Not at all," said Wraysford, meaning quite the opposite to what he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="648" id="dominics.c0.p648"><s>"Well, if you'll believe me, I've lost my temper oftener in trying to keep this resolution than I ever remember to have done before.</s> <s>But on Friday it came over me just as I was going to thrash Loman.</s> <s>That's why I didn't."</s> </p>

<p pid="675" id="dominics.c0.p675"><s>Stephen, before he had been a fortnight in the school, found himself very much at home at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>He was not one of those exuberant, irrepressible boys who take their class-fellows by storm, and rise to the top of the tree almost as soon as they touch the bottom.</s> <s>Stephen, as the reader knows, was not a very clever boy, or a very dashing boy, and yet he somehow managed to get his footing among his comrades in the Fourth Junior, and particularly among his fellow Guinea-pigs.</s> </p>

<p pid="676" id="dominics.c0.p676"><s>He had fought Master Bramble six times in three days during his second week, and was engaged to fight him again every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during the term.</s> <s>He had also taken the chair at one indignation meeting against the monitors, and spoken in favour of a resolution at another.</s> <s>He had distributed brandy-balls in a most handsome manner to his particular adherents, and he had been the means of carrying away no less than two blankets from the next dormitory.</s> <s>This was pretty good for a fortnight.</s> <s>Add to this that he had remained steadily at the bottom of his class during the entire period, and that once he had received an "impot" (or imposition) from Mr Rastle, and it will easily be understood that he soon gained favour among his fellows.</s> </p>

<p pid="677" id="dominics.c0.p677"><s>This last cause of celebrity, however, was one which did not please Stephen.</s> <s>He had come to Saint Dominic's with a great quantity of good resolutions, the chief of which was that he would work hard and keep out of mischief, and it grieved him much to find that in neither aim was he succeeding.</s> </p>

<p pid="678" id="dominics.c0.p678" type="speech"><s>The first evening or two he had worked very diligently at preparation.</s> <s>He had taken pains with his fractions, and looked out every word in his Caesar.</s> <s>He had got Oliver to look over his French, and Loman had volunteered to correct the spelling of his <qs/>"theme;"<qe/> and yet he stuck at the bottom of the class.</s> <s>Other boys went up and down.</s> <s>Some openly boasted that they had had their lessons done for them, and others that they had not done them at all.</s> <s>A merry time they had of it; but Stephen, down at the bottom, was in dismal dumps.</s> <s>He could not get up, and he could not get down, and all his honest hard work went for nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="679" id="dominics.c0.p679" type="speech"><s>And so, not content to give that system a longer trial, he grew more lax in his work.</s> <s>He filched the answers to his sums out of the <qs/>"Key,"<qe/><sls/> and copied his Caesar out of the <sle/><qs/>"crib."<qe/></s> <s>It was much easier, and the result was the same.</s> <s>He did not get up, and he could not get down.</s> </p>

<p pid="680" id="dominics.c0.p680"><s>Oliver catechised him now and then as to his progress, and received vague answers in reply, and Loman never remembered a fag that pestered him less with lessons.</s> <s>Stephen was, in fact, settling down into the slough of idleness, and would have become an accomplished dunce in time, had not Mr Rastle come to the rescue.</s> <s>That gentleman caught the new boy in an idle mood, wandering aimlessly down the passage one afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="693" id="dominics.c0.p693"><s>Stephen was astonished at this question.</s> <s>If any one knew how he was getting on in class Mr Rastle did, and, alas!</s> <s>Mr Rastle must know well enough that Stephen was getting on badly.</s> </p>

<p pid="694" id="dominics.c0.p694"><s>"Not very well, I'm afraid, sir, thank you," replied the boy, not feeling exactly comfortable.</s> </p>

<p pid="695" id="dominics.c0.p695"><s>"Not?</s> <s>That's a pity.</s> <s>Are the lessons too hard for you?" kindly inquired Mr Rastle.</s> </p>

<p pid="697" id="dominics.c0.p697"><s>"Ah, your Latin exercise I thought was very fair in parts to-day."</s> </p>

<p pid="698" id="dominics.c0.p698"><s>Stephen stared at his master, and the master looked very pleasantly at Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="699" id="dominics.c0.p699"><s>"I copied it off Raddleston," said the boy, in a trembling voice, and mentally resigning himself to his fate.</s> </p>

<p pid="700" id="dominics.c0.p700" type="speech"><s>"Ah!" said Mr Rastle, laughing; <qs/>"it's a funny thing, now, Greenfield, I knew that myself.</s> <s>No two boys could possibly have translated `nobody' into `_nullus corpus_' without making common cause!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="701" id="dominics.c0.p701"><s>Stephen was desperately perplexed.</s> <s>He had expected a regular row on the head of his confession, and here was his master cracking jokes about the affair!</s> </p>

<p pid="702" id="dominics.c0.p702"><s>"I'm very sorry I did it.</s> <s>I won't do it again," said he.</s> <s>"That's right, my boy; Raddleston isn't infallible.</s> <s>Much better do it yourself.</s> <s>I venture to say, now, you can tell me what the Latin for `nobody' is without a dictionary."</s> </p>

<p pid="703" id="dominics.c0.p703"><s>"_Nemo_," promptly replied Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="704" id="dominics.c0.p704"><s>"Of course! and therefore if you had done the exercise yourself you wouldn't have made that horrid--that fearful mistake!"</s> </p>

<p pid="705" id="dominics.c0.p705" type="speech"><s>Stephen said, <qs/>"Yes, sir,"<qe/> and meditated.</s> </p>

<p pid="707" id="dominics.c0.p707"><s>"I'll try, sir," said Stephen, meaning what he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="708" id="dominics.c0.p708"><s>"I know you will, my boy.</s> <s>It's not easy work to begin with, but it's easier far in the long run.</s> <s>Try, and if you have difficulties, as you are sure to have, come to me.</s> <s>I'm always here in the evenings, and we'll hammer it out between us.</s> <s>School will not be without its temptations, and you will find it hard always to do your duty.</s> <s>Yet you have, I hope, learnt the power of prayer; and surely the Saviour is able not only to forgive us our sins, but also to keep us from falling.</s> <s>At school, my boy, as elsewhere, it is a safe rule, whenever one is in doubt, to avoid everything, no matter who may be the tempter, of which one cannot fearlessly speak to one's father or mother, and above all to our Heavenly Father.</s> <s>Don't be afraid of Him--He will always be ready to help you and to guide you with His Holy Spirit.</s> <s>Have another cup of tea?"</s> </p>

<p pid="709" id="dominics.c0.p709"><s>This little talk, much as he missed at the time its deeper meaning, saved Stephen from becoming a dunce.</s> <s>He still blundered and boggled over his lessons, and still kept pretty near to the bottom form in his class, but he felt that his master had an interest in him, and that acted like magic to his soul.</s> <s>He declined Master Raddleston's professional assistance for the future, and did the best he could by himself.</s> <s>He now and then, though hesitatingly, availed himself of Mr Rastle's offer, and took his difficulties to head-quarters; and he always, when he did so, found the master ready and glad to help, and not only that, but to explain as he went along, and clear the way of future obstacles of the same sort.</s> </p>

<p pid="710" id="dominics.c0.p710"><s>And so things looked up with Stephen.</s> <s>He wrote jubilant letters home; he experienced all the joys of an easy conscience, and he felt that he had a friend at court.</s> </p>

<p pid="711" id="dominics.c0.p711"><s>But as long as he was a member of the honourable fraternity of Guinea-pigs, Stephen Greenfield was not likely to be dull at Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="712" id="dominics.c0.p712"><s>The politics of the lower school were rather intricate.</s> <s>The Guinea-pigs were not exactly the enemies of the Tadpoles, but the rivals.</s> <s>They were always jangling among themselves, it was true; and when Stephen, for the second time in one week, had hit Bramble in the eye, there was such jubilation among the Guinea-pigs that any one might have supposed the two clans were at daggers drawn.</s> <s>But it was not so--at least, not always--for though they fell out among themselves, they united their forces against the common enemy--the monitors!</s> </p>

<p pid="713" id="dominics.c0.p713"><s>Monitors, in the opinion of these young republicans, were an invention of the Evil One, invented for the sole purpose of interfering with them.</s> <s>But for the monitors they could carry out their long-cherished scheme of a pitched battle on the big staircase, for asserting their right to go down the left side, when they chose, and up on the right.</s> <s>As it was, the monitors insisted that they should go up on the left and come down on the right.</s> <s>It was intolerable tyranny!</s> <s>And but for the monitors their comb-and-paper musical society might give daily recitals in the top corridor and so delight all Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>What right had the monitors to forbid the performance and confiscate the combs?</s> <s>Was it to be endured?</s> <s>And but for the monitors, once more, they might perfect themselves in the art of pea-shooting.</s> <s>Was such a thing ever heard of, as that fellows should be compelled to shoot peas at the wall in the privacy of their own studies, instead of at one another in the passages?</s> <s>It was a shame--it was a scandal--it was a crime!</s> </p>

<p pid="714" id="dominics.c0.p714"><s>On burning questions such as these, Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles sunk all petty differences, and thought and felt as one man; and not the least ardent among them was Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="753" id="dominics.c0.p753"><s>Stephen obeyed, and was very humble in explaining to Loman that he had forgotten (which was the case) the time.</s> <s>The meeting in the Fourth class-room lasted most of the afternoon; but as oratory in whispers is tedious, and constant repetition of the same sentiments, however patriotic, is monotonous, it flagged considerably in spirit towards the end, and degenerated into one of the usual wrangles between Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, in the midst of which Master Bramble left the chair, and went off in the meekest manner possible to get Wren to help him with his sums for next day.</s> </p>

<p pid="754" id="dominics.c0.p754"><s>Stephen meanwhile was engaged in doing a little piece of business for Loman, of which more must be said in a following chapter.</s> </p>

<p pid="755" id="dominics.c0.p755"><s>CHAPTER ELEVEN.</s> <s>IN THE TOILS.</s> </p>

<p pid="756" id="dominics.c0.p756" type="speech"><s>The afternoon of the famous "indignation meeting" in the Fourth Junior was the afternoon of the week which Mr Cripps the younger, putting aside for a season the anxieties and responsibilities of his "public" duties in Maltby, usually devoted to the pursuit of the <qs/>"gentle craft,"<qe/> at his worthy father's cottage by Gusset Weir.</s> <s>Loman, who was aware of this circumstance, and on whose spirit that restless top joint had continued to prey ever since the evening of the misadventure a week ago, determined to avail himself of the opportunity of returning the unlucky fishing-rod into the hands from which he had received it.</s> </p>

<p pid="757" id="dominics.c0.p757"><s>He therefore instructed Stephen to take it up to the lock-house with a note to the effect that having changed his mind in the matter since speaking to Cripps, he found he should not require the rod, and therefore returned it, with many thanks for Mr Cripps's trouble.</s> </p>

<p pid="758" id="dominics.c0.p758" type="speech"><s>Stephen, little suspecting the questionable nature of his errand, undertook the commission, and duly delivered both rod and letter into the hands of Mr Cripps, who greatly astonished him by swearing very violently at the contents of the letter.</s> <s>"Well,<qs/>" said he, when he had exhausted his vocabulary (not a small one) of expletives--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>well, of all the grinning jackanapeses, this is the coolest go!</s> <s>Do you take me for a fool?"<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="759" id="dominics.c0.p759" type="speech"><s>Stephen, to whom this question appeared to be directly applied, disclaimed any idea of the kind, and added, <qs/>"I don't know what you mean."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="760" id="dominics.c0.p760"><s>"Don't you, my young master?</s> <s>All right!</s> <s>Tell Mr Loman I'll wait upon him one fine day, see if I don't!</s> <s>Here's me, given up a whole blessed day to serve him, and a pot of money out of my pocket, and here he goes! not a penny for my pains!</s> <s>Chucks the thing back on my 'ands as cool as a coocumber, all because he's changed his mind.</s> <s>I'll let him have a bit of my mind, tell him, Mr Gentleman Schoolboy, see if I don't.</s> <s>I ain't a-going to be robbed, no! not by all the blessed monkeys that ever wrote on slates!</s> <s>_I'll_ wait upon him, see if I don't!"</s> </p>

<p pid="761" id="dominics.c0.p761"><s>Stephen, to whom the whole of this oration, which was garnished with words that we can hardly set down in print, or degrade ourselves by suggesting, was about as intelligible as if it had been Hebrew, thought it better to make no reply, and sorrowed inwardly to find that such a nice man as Mr Cripps should possess so short a temper.</s> <s>But the landlord of the Cockchafer soon recovered from his temporary annoyance, and even proceeded to apologise to Stephen for the warmth of his language.</s> </p>

<p pid="762" id="dominics.c0.p762" type="speech"><s>"You'll excuse me, young gentleman," said he, <qs/>"but I'm a plain-spoken man, and I was--there, I won't deny it--I was a bit put out about this here rod first go off.</s> <s>You'll excuse me--of course I don't mean no offence to you or Mister Loman neither, who's one of the nicest young gentlemen I ever met.</s> <s>Of course if you'd a' paid seventy bob out of your own pocket it would give _you_ a turn; leastways, if you was a struggling, honest working man, like me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="763" id="dominics.c0.p763" type="speech"><s>"That's it," snivelled, old Mr Cripps, who had entered during this last speech; <qs/>"that's it, Benny, my boy, honest Partisans, that's what we is, who knows what it are to be in want of a shillin' to buy a clo' or two for the little childer."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="764" id="dominics.c0.p764"><s>What particular little "childer" Mr Cripps senior and his son were specially interested in no one knew, for neither of them was blessed with any.</s> <s>However, it was one of old Mr Cripps's heart-moving phrases, and no one was rude enough to ask questions.</s> </p>

<p pid="765" id="dominics.c0.p765"><s>Stephen did not, on the present occasion, feel moved to respond to the old man's lament, and Cripps junior, with more adroitness than filial affection, hustled the old gentleman out of the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="766" id="dominics.c0.p766" type="speech"><s>"Never mind him," said he to Stephen.</s> <s>"He's a silly old man, and always pretends he's starvin'.</s> <s>If you believe me, he's a thousand pounds stowed away somewheres.</s> <s>I on'y wish," added he, with a sigh, <qs/>"he'd give me a taste of it, for its 'ard, up-'ill work makin' ends meet, particular when a man's deceived by parties.</s> <s>No matter.</s> <s>I'll pull through; you see!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="767" id="dominics.c0.p767"><s>Stephen once more did not feel called upon to pursue this line of conversation, and therefore changed the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="768" id="dominics.c0.p768"><s>"Oh, Mr Cripps, how much is that bat?"</s> </p>

<p pid="769" id="dominics.c0.p769"><s>"Bat!</s> <s>Bless me if I hadn't nearly forgot all about it.</s> <s>Ain't it a beauty, now?"</s> </p>

<p pid="770" id="dominics.c0.p770"><s>"Yes, pretty well," said Stephen, whose friends had one and all abused the bat, and who was himself a little disappointed in his expectations.</s> </p>

<p pid="771" id="dominics.c0.p771"><s>"Pretty well!</s> <s>I like that.</s> <s>You must be a funny cricketer, young gentleman, to call that bat only pretty well.</s> <s>I suppose you want me to take _that_ back, too?" and here Mr Cripps looked very fierce.</s> </p>

<p pid="772" id="dominics.c0.p772"><s>"Oh, no," said Stephen, hurriedly.</s> <s>"I only want to know what I am to pay for it."</s> </p>

<p pid="773" id="dominics.c0.p773"><s>"Oh, come now, we needn't mind about that.</s> <s>That'll keep, you know.</s> <s>As if I wanted the money.</s> <s>Ha, ha!"</s> </p>

<p pid="774" id="dominics.c0.p774"><s>Even a green boy like Stephen could not fail to wonder why, if Mr Cripps was as hard up as he had just described himself, he should now be so anxious to represent himself as not in want of money.</s> </p>

<p pid="775" id="dominics.c0.p775"><s>"Please, I want to know the price."</s> </p>

<p pid="776" id="dominics.c0.p776"><s>"As if I was a-going to name prices to a young gentleman like you!</s> <s>Please yourself about it.</s> <s>I shall not be disappointed if you gives me only eighteenpence, and if _you_ thinks twelve bob is handsome, well, let it be.</s> <s>_I_ can struggle on somehow."</s> </p>

<p pid="777" id="dominics.c0.p777"><s>This was uncomfortable for Stephen, who, too green, fortunately, to comprehend the drift of Mr Cripps's gentle hints, again asked that he would name a price.</s> </p>

<p pid="778" id="dominics.c0.p778"><s>This time Mr Cripps answered more precisely.</s> </p>

<p pid="779" id="dominics.c0.p779"><s>"Well, that there bat is worth a guinea, if you want to know, but I'll say a sovereign for cash down."</s> </p>

<p pid="780" id="dominics.c0.p780"><s>Stephen whistled a long-drawn whistle of dismay.</s> </p>

<p pid="781" id="dominics.c0.p781"><s>"A sovereign!</s> <s>I can't pay all that!</s> <s>I thought it would be about seven shillings!"</s> </p>

<p pid="782" id="dominics.c0.p782"><s>"Did you?</s> <s>You may think what you like, but that's my price, and you are lucky to get it at that."</s> </p>

<p pid="783" id="dominics.c0.p783"><s>"I shall have to send it back.</s> <s>I can't afford so much," said Stephen, despondingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="784" id="dominics.c0.p784"><s>"Not if I know it!</s> <s>I'll have none of your second-hand bats, if I know it.</s> <s>Come, young gentleman, I may be a poor man, but I'm not a fool, and you'll find it out if I've any of your nonsense.</s> <s>Do you suppose I've nothing to do but wait on jackanapeses like you and your mates?</s> <s>No error!</s> <s>There you are.</s> <s>That'll do, and if you don't like it--well, the governor shall know about it!"</s> </p>

<p pid="785" id="dominics.c0.p785"><s>Stephen was dreadfully uncomfortable.</s> <s>Though, to his knowledge, he had done nothing wrong, he felt terribly guilty at the bare notion of the Doctor being informed of his transactions with Mr Cripps, besides greatly in awe of the vague threats held out by that gentleman.</s> <s>He did not venture on further argument, but, bidding a hasty farewell, returned as fast as he could to Saint Dominic's, wondering whatever Oliver would say, and sorely repenting the day when first he was tempted to think of the unlucky bat.</s> </p>

<p pid="786" id="dominics.c0.p786"><s>He made a clean breast of it to his brother that evening, who, of course, called him an ass, and everything else complimentary, and was deservedly angry.</s> <s>However, Stephen had reason to consider himself lucky to possess an elder brother at the school who had a little more shrewdness than himself.</s> <s>Oliver was determined the debt should be paid at once, without even waiting to write home, and by borrowing ten shillings from Wraysford, and adding to it the residue of his own pocket-money, the sovereign was raised and dispatched that very night to Mr Cripps; after which Oliver commanded his brother to sit down and write a full confession of his folly home, and ask for the money, promising never to make such a fool of himself again.</s> <s>This task the small boy, with much shame and trembling at heart, accomplished; and in due time an answer came from his mother which not only relieved his mind but paid off his debts to Oliver and Wraysford, and once for all closed the business of the treble-cane splice bat.</s> </p>

<p pid="787" id="dominics.c0.p787"><s>It would have been well for Loman if he could have got out of his difficulties as easily and as satisfactorily.</s> </p>

<p pid="788" id="dominics.c0.p788"><s>Ever since he had gathered from Stephen Mr Cripps's wrath on receiving the returned rod, he had been haunted by a dread lest the landlord of the Cockchafer should march up to Saint Dominic's, and possibly make an exposure of the unhappy business before the Doctor and the whole school.</s> <s>He therefore, after long hesitation and misgiving, determined himself to call at the Cockchafer, and try in some way to settle matters.</s> <s>One thing reassured him.</s> <s>If Cripps had discovered the crack or the fracture in the rod, he would have heard of it long before now; and if he had not, then the longer the time the less chance was there of the damage being laid at his door.</s> <s>So he let three weeks elapse, and then went to Maltby.</s> <s>The Cockchafer was a small, unpretentious tavern, frequented chiefly by carriers and tradesmen, and, I regret to say, not wholly unknown to some of the boys of Saint Dominic's, who were foolish enough to persuade themselves that skittles, and billiards, and beer were luxuries worth the risk incurred by breaking one of the rules of the school.</s> <s>No boy was permitted to enter any place of refreshment except a confectioner's in Maltby under the penalty of a severe punishment, which might, in a bad case, mean expulsion.</s> <s>Loman, therefore, a monitor and a Sixth Form boy, had to take more than ordinary precautions to reach the Cockchafer unobserved, which he succeeded in doing, and to his satisfaction--as well as to his trepidation--found Mr Cripps the younger at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="789" id="dominics.c0.p789" type="speech"><s>"Ho, he! my young shaver," was that worthy's greeting, <qs/>"here you are at last."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="828" id="dominics.c0.p828"><s>The circumstances which had attended the publication of the first number of the _Dominican_ had been such as to throw a damper over the future success of that valuable paper.</s> <s>It was most uncomfortably connected in the minds of the Fifth with the cowardice of Oliver Greenfield, and with the stigma which his conduct had cast upon the whole Form, and they one and all experienced a great diminution of interest in its future.</s> </p>

<p pid="829" id="dominics.c0.p829" type="speech"><s>The Fifth were far more intent on vindicating their reputation with the Sixth--and, indeed, with the rest of the school.</s> <s>They sought every opportunity of bringing on a collision with the monitors.</s> <s>One or two of their number went, so far as to pick quarrels with members of the rival class, in hopes of a fight.</s> <s>But in this they were not successful.</s> <s>The Sixth chose to look upon this display of feeling among their juniors as a temporary aberration of mind, and were by no means to be tempted into hostilities.</s> <s>They asserted their authority wherever they could enforce it, and sacrificed it whenever it seemed more discreet to do so.</s> <s>Only one thing evoked a temporary display of vexation from them, and that was when Ricketts and Braddy appeared one day, arm-in-arm, in the passages with _tall hats_ on their heads.</s> <s>Now, tall hats on week-days were the exclusive privilege of the Sixth at Saint Dominic's, and, worn by them during school hours, served as the badge of monitorship.</s> <s>This action on the part of the Fifth, therefore, was as good as a usurpation of monitorial rights, and that the Sixth were not disposed to stand.</s> <s>However, Raleigh, the captain, when appealed to, pooh-poohed the matter.</s> <s>"Let them be," said he; <qs/>"what do you want to make a row about it for?</s> <s>If the boys do mistake them for monitors, so much the less row in the passages."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="830" id="dominics.c0.p830" type="speech"><s>Raleigh was always a man of peace--though it was rumoured he could, if he chose, thrash any two Dominicans going--and the monitors were much disgusted to find that he did not authorise them to interfere with the Fifth in the matter.</s> <s>But the Fifth _were_ interfered with in another quarter, and in a way which caused them to drop their chimney-pots completely.</s> <s>One afternoon the entire Fourth Junior appeared in the corridors in their Sunday tiles!</s> <s>In their Sunday tiles they slid down the banisters; in their Sunday tiles they played leapfrog; in their Sunday tiles they executed a monster tug-of-war in the bottom corridor!</s> <s>Stephen and Bramble fought their usual battle in top hats, and Master Paul insisted on wearing the same decoration while washing up Oliver's tea-things.</s> <s>It was a splendid hit, and for once in a way Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles scored one, for the Fifth appeared next day in their ordinary <qs/>"boilers,"<qe/> and the dignity of the monitors was vindicated.</s> </p>

<p pid="831" id="dominics.c0.p831"><s>But the blood was up between Fifth and Sixth, and each Form looked forward to the match, Sixth _versus_ School, with redoubled interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="833" id="dominics.c0.p833"><s>To be sure they were, sir.</s> <s>But what of that? they were none the less boys, and most of them fine young fellows, too, with all their nonsense.</s> </p>

<p pid="834" id="dominics.c0.p834"><s>However, as has been said, all this came out of the circumstances which attended the bringing out of the first number of the _Dominican_, and there seemed but a poor look-out for Number 2, which was now nearly due, in consequence.</s> </p>

<p pid="835" id="dominics.c0.p835" type="speech"><s>"What on earth am I to do?" asked Pembury of Tom Senior one day; <qs/>"I've not got a single contribution yet.</s> <s>There's you making out you're too busy, and Rick the same.</s> <s>It's all humbug, I know!</s> <s>What are you busy at I'd like to know?</s> <s>I never saw you busy yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="839" id="dominics.c0.p839"><s>Ricketts had an excuse very similar.</s> <s>Bullinger had hurt his foot, he said, and could not possibly write; and Braddy had begun to study fossils, he said, and was bound to devote all his spare time to them.</s> <s>To all of whom Master Pembury gave a piece of his mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="840" id="dominics.c0.p840" type="speech"><s>"Wray, old man," said he, that evening, <qs/>"you and Noll and I shall have to do the whole thing between us, that's all about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="841" id="dominics.c0.p841" type="speech"><s>"Awfully sorry!" said Wraysford; <qs/>"you'll have to let me off this time.</s> <s>I'm working like nails for the Nightingale."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="844" id="dominics.c0.p844"><s>Oliver was as bad; he declared the things he had written before--even with Pembury's assistance--had taken him such ages to do, that he wasn't going in for the next number.</s> <s>He was very sorry to disappoint, and all that; but if Tony was in for a scholarship next Michaelmas he would understand the reason.</s> <s>Why not let the thing drop this month?</s> </p>

<p pid="845" id="dominics.c0.p845"><s>This, however, by no means met Tony's views.</s> <s>A pretty figure he would cut if it were to be said he couldn't keep up a paper for two numbers running!</s> <s>No! his mind was made up.</s> <s>Number 2 _should_ come out, even if he wrote every word of it himself!</s> <s>And with that determination he hobbled off to his study.</s> <s>Here he met Simon waiting for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="846" id="dominics.c0.p846" type="speech"><s>"Oh," said the poet; <qs/>"I only brought this, if you'll put it in.</s> <s>I think it's not bad.</s> <s>I could make it longer if you like.</s> <s>I find poetry comes so easily, you know!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="847" id="dominics.c0.p847"><s>Tony glanced over the paper and grinned.</s> <s>"Thanks, awfully!</s> <s>This will do capitally; it would spoil it to make it any longer.</s> <s>You're a brick, Simon!</s> <s>I wish _I_ could write poetry."</s> </p>

<p pid="848" id="dominics.c0.p848"><s>"Oh, never mind.</s> <s>I could do some more bits about other things, you know, if you like."</s> </p>

<p pid="850" id="dominics.c0.p850" type="speech"><s>With one contribution in hand, Tony locked his door and sat down to write.</s> <s>There was something out of the common about Pembury.</s> <s>With the body of a cripple he had the heart of a lion, and difficulties only made it more dauntless.</s> <s>Any one else would have thought twice, indeed, before undertaking the task he was now setting himself to do, and ninety-nine out of every hundred would have abandoned it before it was half done.</s> <s>But Tony was indomitable.</s> <s>Every night that week he locked his study-door, and threats and kicks and entreaties would not open it even to his dearest friends.</s> <s>And slowly the huge white sheet before him showed the signs of his diligence.</s> <s>The great long columns, one after another, filled up; paragraph followed paragraph, and article article.</s> <s>He coolly continued the "History of Saint Dominic's" begun last month by Bullinger, and the "Reports of the Sixth Form Debates" commenced by Tom Senior.</s> <s>And the "Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse" went on just as if Wraysford had never abandoned it; and the poem on the Guinea-pigs, promised in Number 1, by the author of <qs/>"To a Tadpole,"<qe/> duly appeared also.</s> <s>Besides this, there were the continuations of Tony's own articles, and his <qs/>"Personal Notes,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Squeaks from Tadpoleopolis,"<qe/> and advertisements just as usual; until, in due time, the last column was filled up, the sheet triumphantly fixed in its frame, and as triumphantly hung up on its own particular nails on the wall outside the Fifth Form door.</s> </p>

<p pid="851" id="dominics.c0.p851"><s>It was a feat to be proud of, and Tony was justly and pardonably proud.</s> <s>It was at least a gratification next morning to see not only that the school generally took unabated interest in the _Dominican_, but that he had fairly astonished his own class-fellows.</s> <s>Their admiration of the editor was unbounded and undisguised.</s> <s>Their consciences had all, more or less, reproached them for backing out of their responsibilities in the way they had; and now it quite touched them to see how, notwithstanding, Anthony had by his own labour made up for their defect, and sustained the reputation of the Fifth before all the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="852" id="dominics.c0.p852"><s>The crush outside the door was greater than ever this time, and Master Paul, who again acted as policeman, was obliged to summon Stephen to his assistance in watching to see that no damage came to the precious document.</s> </p>

<p pid="855" id="dominics.c0.p855"><s>This version of the incident was by no means pleasant to Loman, but to every one else it was highly diverting, and it actually made one or two of the Fifth think that Oliver, after all, had not done such a very discreditable thing in taking that angry word in silence.</s> <s>If only he had shown more spirit about the blow, they could have forgiven the rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="875" id="dominics.c0.p875"><s>"This book appears to be the praiseworthy attempt of some ambitious little boys to enter the field of letters.</s> <s>We are always pleased to encourage juvenile talent, but we would suggest that our young friends might have done better had they kept to their picture-books a little longer before launching out into literature on their own account.</s> <s>In the words of the poet we might say--</s> </p>

<p pid="876" id="dominics.c0.p876"><s>"Babies, wait a little longer, Till the little wings are stronger, Then you'll fly away."</s> </p>

<p pid="877" id="dominics.c0.p877"><s>"Nevertherless, we would refer to one or two of these interesting attempts.</s> <s>Take, for example, the essay on the `Character of Julius Caesar,' by one who signs himself Raleigh.</s> <s>This is very well written.</s> <s>Pains have been taken about the formation of the letters, and some of the capitals are specially worthy of praise.</s> <s>For one so young, we rarely saw the capital D so well done.</s> <s>Dr Smith, were he alive, would be pleased to see his remarks on Caesar so well and accurately copied out.</s> <s>Master Wren gives us some verse--a translation out of Horace.</s> <s>We wonder if Mr Wren is any relation to the late Jenny Wren who married Mr Cock Robin.</s> <s>We should imagine from these verses that Mr Wren must be well acquainted with _Robbin_.</s> <s>Take one more, Master Loman's `A Funny Story.'</s> <s>We are sorry to find Master Loman tells stories.</s> <s>Boys shouldn't tell stories; it's not right.</s> <s>But Master Loman unfortunately does tell stories, and this is one.</s> <s>He calls it `A Funny Story.'</s> <s>That is a story to begin with, for it is not funny.</s> <s>We don't know what Master Loman thinks funny; perhaps he calls being run out at cricket funny, or hitting another boy in the mouth when he's looking another way.</s> <s>In any case, we can't make out why he calls this story funny.</s> <s>The only funny thing about it is its title, and his spelling `attach' `attatch.'</s> <s>The last is really funny.</s> <s>It shows how partial Mr Loman is to _tea_.</s> <s>If this funny story is the result of his partiality to tea, we are afraid it was very weak stuff."</s> </p>

<p pid="878" id="dominics.c0.p878"><s>Loman, who had already been made dreadfully uncomfortable by Simon's poem, made no secret of his rage over this number of the _Dominican_.</s> <s>He was one of those vain fellows who cannot see a jest where it is levelled at themselves.</s> <s>The rest of the Sixth had the sense, whatever they felt, to laugh at Anthony's hard hits.</s> <s>But not so Loman; he lost his temper completely.</s> <s>He ordered the _Dominican_ to be taken down; he threatened to report the whole Fifth to the Doctor.</s> <s>He would not allow the junior boys to stand and read it.</s> <s>In short, he made a regular ass of himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="879" id="dominics.c0.p879"><s>Undoubtedly Anthony had put a great deal of venom into his pen.</s> <s>Still, by taking all the poison and none of the humour to himself Loman made a great mistake, and displayed a most unfortunate amount of weakness.</s> </p>

<p pid="880" id="dominics.c0.p880"><s>He shut himself up in his study in a fume; he boxed Stephen's ears for nothing at all, and would see no one for the rest of the evening.</s> <s>He knew well he could not have given his enemies a greater crow over him than such conduct, and yet he could not command his vanity to act otherwise.</s> </p>

<p pid="881" id="dominics.c0.p881"><s>But that evening, just before tea-time, something happened which gave Loman more to think about than the _Dominican_.</s> <s>A letter marked "Immediate" came to him by the post.</s> <s>It was from Cripps, to say that, after all, Sir Patrick _had_ won the Derby!</s> </p>

<p pid="882" id="dominics.c0.p882"><s>CHAPTER THIRTEEN.</s> <s>COMPANY AT THE COCKCHAFER.</s> </p>

<p pid="883" id="dominics.c0.p883"><s>Cripps's letter was as follows:</s> </p>

<p pid="884" id="dominics.c0.p884"><s>"Hon.</s> <s>Sir,--This comes hoping you are well.</s> <s>You may like to know Sir Patrick won.</s> <s>The tip was all out.</s> <s>Honourable Sir,--My friend would like his ten pounds sharp, as he's a poor man.</s> <s>Please call in on Saturday afternoon.</s> <s>Your very humble servant, Ben Cripps."</s> </p>

<p pid="885" id="dominics.c0.p885"><s>This letter was startling enough to drive fifty _Dominicans_ out of Loman's head, and for a long time he could hardly realise how bad the news it contained was.</s> </p>

<p pid="886" id="dominics.c0.p886"><s>He had reckoned to a dead certainty on winning the bet which Cripps had advised him to make with his friend.</s> <s>Not that Loman knew anything about racing matters, but Cripps had been so confident, and it seemed so safe to bet against this one particular horse, that the idea of events turning out otherwise had never once entered his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="887" id="dominics.c0.p887"><s>He went to the door and shouted for Stephen, who presently appeared with a paper dart in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="888" id="dominics.c0.p888" type="speech"><s>"Greenfield," said Loman, <qs/>"cut down at once to Maltby and bring me a newspaper."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="889" id="dominics.c0.p889"><s>Stephen stared.</s> </p>

<p pid="890" id="dominics.c0.p890"><s>"I've got my lessons to do," he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="891" id="dominics.c0.p891" type="speech"><s>"Leave them here, I'll do them," replied Loman; <qs/>"look sharp."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="892" id="dominics.c0.p892"><s>Still Stephen hesitated.</s> </p>

<p pid="893" id="dominics.c0.p893"><s>"We aren't allowed out after seven without leave," he faltered, longing to get back to the war preparations in the Fourth Junior.</s> </p>

<p pid="894" id="dominics.c0.p894"><s>"I know that, and I give you leave--there!" said Loman, with all the monitorial dignity he could assume.</s> <s>This quite disarmed Stephen.</s> <s>Of course a monitor could do no wrong, and it was no use objecting on that score.</s> </p>

<p pid="895" id="dominics.c0.p895"><s>Still he was fain to find some other excuse.</s> </p>

<p pid="896" id="dominics.c0.p896"><s>"I say, will it do in the morning?" he began.</s> </p>

<p pid="897" id="dominics.c0.p897"><s>Loman's only reply was a book shied at his fag's head--quite explicit enough for all practical purposes.</s> <s>So Stephen hauled down his colours and prepared to start.</s> </p>

<p pid="898" id="dominics.c0.p898" type="speech"><s>"Look sharp back," said Loman, <qs/>"and don't let any one see you going out.</s> <s>Look here, you can get yourself some brandy-balls with this."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="899" id="dominics.c0.p899"><s>Stephen was not philosopher enough to argue with himself why, if he had leave to go out, he ought to avoid being seen going out.</s> <s>He pocketed Loman's extra penny complacently, and giving one last longing look in the direction of the Fourth Junior, slipped quietly out of the school and made the best of his way down to Maltby.</s> </p>

<p pid="900" id="dominics.c0.p900"><s>It was not easy at that time of day to get a paper.</s> <s>Stephen tried half a dozen stationers' shops, but they were all sold out.</s> <s>They were evidently more sought after than brandy-balls, of which he had no difficulty in securing a pennyworth at an early stage of his pilgrimage.</s> <s>The man in the sweet-shop told him his only chance of getting a paper was at the railway station.</s> </p>

<p pid="901" id="dominics.c0.p901"><s>So to the station he strolled, with a brandy-ball in each cheek.</s> <s>Alas! the stall was closed for the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="902" id="dominics.c0.p902" type="speech"><s>Stephen did not like to be beaten, but there was nothing for it now but to give up this <qs/>"paper-chase,"<qe/> and return to Loman with a report of his ill-success.</s> </p>

<p pid="903" id="dominics.c0.p903"><s>As he trotted back up High Street, looking about everywhere but in the direction in which he was going (as is the habit of small boys), and wondering in his heart whether his funds could possibly stand the strain of another pennyworth of brandy-balls, he suddenly found himself in sharp collision with a man who expressed himself on the subject of clumsy boys generally in no very measured terms.</s> </p>

<p pid="904" id="dominics.c0.p904"><s>Stephen looked up and saw Mr Cripps the younger standing before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="905" id="dominics.c0.p905" type="speech"><s>"Why!" exclaimed that worthy, giving over his irascible expletives, and adopting an air of unfeigned pleasure, <qs/>"why, if it ain't young Master Greenhorn.</s> <s>Ha, ha!</s> <s>How do, my young bantam?</s> <s>Pretty bobbish, eh?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="906" id="dominics.c0.p906" type="speech"><s>Stephen did not know exactly what was meant by <qs/>"bobbish,"<qe/> but replied that he was quite well, and sorry he had trodden on Mr Cripps's toes.</s> </p>

<p pid="907" id="dominics.c0.p907" type="speech"><s>"Never mind," said Mr Cripps, magnanimously, <qs/>"you're a light weight.</s> <s>And so you're taking a dander down town, are you? looking for lollipops, eh?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="908" id="dominics.c0.p908"><s>Stephen blushed very red at this.</s> <s>However had Mr Cripps guessed about the brandy-balls?</s> </p>

<p pid="909" id="dominics.c0.p909" type="speech"><s>"I came to get a paper for Loman," he said, <qs/>"but they're all sold out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="910" id="dominics.c0.p910"><s>"No, are they?</s> <s>I wonder what Mr Loman wants with a paper, now?"</s> </p>

<p pid="911" id="dominics.c0.p911"><s>"He said it was very important, and I was to be sure to get one of to-day's," said Stephen.</s> <s>"Do you know where I can get one?"</s> </p>

<p pid="912" id="dominics.c0.p912"><s>"Of course.</s> <s>Come along with me; I've got one at home you can have.</s> <s>And so he said it was very important, did he?</s> <s>That's queer.</s> <s>There's nothing in to-day's paper at all.</s> <s>Only something about a low horse-race.</s> <s>He don't want it for that, I guess; eh?"</s> </p>

<p pid="913" id="dominics.c0.p913"><s>"Oh, no, I shouldn't think," said Stephen, trotting along beside his amiable acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="914" id="dominics.c0.p914"><s>Mr Cripps was certainly a very friendly man, and as he conducted Stephen to the Cockchafer, Stephen felt quite a liking for him, and couldn't understand why Oliver and Wraysford both ran him down.</s> </p>

<p pid="915" id="dominics.c0.p915"><s>True, Mr Cripps did use some words which didn't seem exactly proper, but that Stephen put down to the habit of men in that part.</s> <s>The man seemed to take such an interest in boys generally, and in Stephen in particular, and was so interested and amused to hear all about the Guinea-pigs, and the _Dominican_, and the Sixth _versus_ School, that Stephen felt quite drawn out to him.</s> <s>And then he told Stephen such a lot of funny stories, and treated him with such evident consideration, that the small boy felt quite flattered and delighted.</s> </p>

<p pid="916" id="dominics.c0.p916"><s>So they reached the Cockchafer.</s> <s>Here Stephen, whose former visits had all been to the lock-house, pulled up.</s> </p>

<p pid="917" id="dominics.c0.p917" type="speech"><s>"I say," said he, <qs/>"is this a public-house?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="918" id="dominics.c0.p918"><s>"Getting on that way," said Mr Cripps.</s> </p>

<p pid="919" id="dominics.c0.p919" type="speech"><s>"We aren't allowed to go in public-houses," said Stephen, <qs/>"it's one of the rules."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="920" id="dominics.c0.p920"><s>"Ah, quite right too; not a good thing for boys at all.</s> <s>We'll go in by the private door into my house," said Mr Cripps.</s> </p>

<p pid="921" id="dominics.c0.p921"><s>Stephen was not quite comfortable at this evasion, but followed Mr Cripps by the side door into his bar parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="922" id="dominics.c0.p922" type="speech"><s>"You won't forget the paper," he said, <qs/>"please.</s> <s>I've got to be back in school directly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="923" id="dominics.c0.p923"><s>"I'll have a look for it.</s> <s>Now, I guess you like ginger-beer, don't you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="924" id="dominics.c0.p924"><s>Stephen was particularly partial to ginger-beer, as it happened, and said so.</s> </p>

<p pid="925" id="dominics.c0.p925"><s>"That's the style," said Mr Cripps, producing a bottle.</s> <s>"Walk into that while I go and get the paper."</s> </p>

<p pid="926" id="dominics.c0.p926"><s>Stephen did walk into it with great relish, and began to think Mr Cripps quite a gentleman.</s> <s>He was certain, even if that bat had been a poor one, it was quite worth the money paid for it, and Oliver was unjust in calling Cripps hard names.</s> </p>

<p pid="927" id="dominics.c0.p927"><s>The landlord very soon returned with the paper.</s> </p>

<p pid="928" id="dominics.c0.p928"><s>"Here you are, young governor.</s> <s>Now don't hurry away.</s> <s>It's lonely here all by myself, and I like a young gentleman like you to talk to.</s> <s>I knew a nice little boy once, just your age, that used to come and see me regular once a week and play bagatelle with me.</s> <s>He was a good player at it too!"</s> </p>

<p pid="929" id="dominics.c0.p929"><s>"Could he get clear-board twice running with two balls?" asked Stephen, half jealous of the fame of this unknown rival.</s> </p>

<p pid="930" id="dominics.c0.p930"><s>"Eh!--no, scarcely that.</s> <s>He wasn't quite such a dab as that."</s> </p>

<p pid="931" id="dominics.c0.p931"><s>"I can do it," said Stephen with a superior smile.</s> </p>

<p pid="932" id="dominics.c0.p932"><s>"You?</s> <s>Not a bit of you!" said Mr Cripps, incredulously.</s> </p>

<p pid="933" id="dominics.c0.p933"><s>"Yes, I can," reiterated Stephen, delighted to have astonished his host.</s> </p>

<p pid="934" id="dominics.c0.p934"><s>"I must see it before I can believe that," said Mr Cripps.</s> <s>"Suppose you show me on my board."</s> </p>

<p pid="935" id="dominics.c0.p935"><s>Stephen promptly accepted the challenge, and forgetting in his excitement all about school rules or Loman's orders accompanied Cripps to the bagatelle-room, with its sanded floor, smelling of stale tobacco and beer-dregs.</s> <s>His first attempt, greatly to Mr Cripps's glee, was unsuccessful.</s> </p>

<p pid="936" id="dominics.c0.p936"><s>"I knew you couldn't," exclaimed that worthy.</s> </p>

<p pid="937" id="dominics.c0.p937"><s>"I know I can do it," said Stephen, excitedly.</s> <s>"Let's try again."</s> </p>

<p pid="938" id="dominics.c0.p938"><s>After a few more trials he made the two clear-boards, and Mr Cripps was duly astonished and impressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="939" id="dominics.c0.p939"><s>"That's what I call smart play," said he.</s> <s>"Now, if I was a betting man, I'd wager a sixpence you couldn't do it again."</s> </p>

<p pid="940" id="dominics.c0.p940"><s>"Yes, I can, but I won't bet," said Stephen.</s> <s>He did do it again, and Mr Cripps said it was a good job for him the young swell didn't bet, or he would have lost his sixpence.</s> <s>Stephen was triumphant.</s> </p>

<p pid="941" id="dominics.c0.p941"><s>How long he would have gone on showing off his prowess to the admiring landlord of the Cockchafer, and how far he might have advanced in the art of public-house bagatelle, I cannot say, but the sudden striking of a clock and the entry of visitors into the room reminded him where he was.</s> </p>

<p pid="942" id="dominics.c0.p942"><s>"I must go back now," he said, hurriedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="943" id="dominics.c0.p943"><s>"Must you?</s> <s>Well, come again soon.</s> <s>I've a great fancy to learn that there stoke.</s> <s>I'm a born fool at bagatelle.</s> <s>What do you say to another ginger-beer before you go?"</s> </p>

<p pid="944" id="dominics.c0.p944" type="speech"><s>Stephen said <qs/>"Thank you,"<qe/> and then taking the newspaper in his hand bade Cripps good-bye.</s> </p>

<p pid="945" id="dominics.c0.p945"><s>"Good-bye, my fine young fellow.</s> <s>You're one of the right sort, you are.</s> <s>No stuck-up nonsense about you.</s> <s>That's why I fancy you.</s> <s>Bye-bye.</s> <s>My love to Mr Loman."</s> </p>

<p pid="946" id="dominics.c0.p946"><s>Stephen hurried back to Saint Dominic's as fast as his legs would carry him.</s> <s>He was not quite comfortable about his evening's proceedings, although he was not aware of having done anything wicked.</s> <s>Loman, a monitor, had given him leave to go down to Maltby, so that was hardly a crime; and as to the Cockchafer--well, he had only been in the private part of the house, and not the public bar, and surely there had been no harm in drinking ginger-beer and playing bagatelle, especially when he had distinctly refused to bet on the latter.</s> <s>But, explain it as he would, Stephen felt uncomfortable enough to determine him to say as little as possible about his expedition.</s> </p>

<p pid="947" id="dominics.c0.p947"><s>He found Loman impatiently awaiting him.</s> </p>

<p pid="948" id="dominics.c0.p948"><s>"Wherever have you been to all this time?" he demanded.</s> </p>

<p pid="949" id="dominics.c0.p949"><s>"The papers were all sold out," said Stephen.</s> <s>"I tried seven places."</s> </p>

<p pid="950" id="dominics.c0.p950"><s>Loman had eagerly caught up and opened the paper while Stephen nervously made this explanation, and he took no further heed of his fag, who presently, seeing he was no longer wanted, and relieved to get out of reach of questions, prudently retired.</s> </p>

<p pid="951" id="dominics.c0.p951"><s>A glance sufficed to confirm the bad news about the Derby.</s> <s>Sir Patrick had won, and it was a fact therefore that Loman owed Cripps and his friend between them thirty pounds, without the least possibility of paying them.</s> </p>

<p pid="952" id="dominics.c0.p952"><s>One thing was certain.</s> <s>He must see Cripps on Saturday, and trust to his luck (though that of late had not been very trustworthy) to pull him through, somehow.</s> </p>

<p pid="953" id="dominics.c0.p953"><s>Alas! what a spirit this, in which to meet difficulties!</s> <s>Loman had yet to learn that it is one thing to regret, and another thing to repent; that it is one thing to call one's self a fool, and another thing, quite, to cease to be one.</s> </p>

<p pid="954" id="dominics.c0.p954"><s>But, as he said to himself, he must go through with it now, and the first step took him deeper than ever into the mire.</s> </p>

<p pid="955" id="dominics.c0.p955"><s>For the coming Saturday was the day of the great cricket match, Sixth versus School, from which a Dominican would as soon think of deserting as of emigrating.</s> </p>

<p pid="956" id="dominics.c0.p956"><s>But Loman must desert if he was to keep his appointment, and he managed the proceeding with his now characteristic untruthfulness; a practice he would have scorned only a few months ago.</s> <s>How easy the first wrong step!</s> <s>What a long weary road when one, with aching heart, attempts to retrace the way!</s> <s>And at present Loman had made no serious effort in that direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="957" id="dominics.c0.p957"><s>On the Friday morning, greatly to the astonishment of all his class-fellows, he appeared in his place with his arm in a sling.</s> </p>

<p pid="958" id="dominics.c0.p958" type="speech"><s>"Hullo, Loman!" said Wren, the first whom he encountered, <qs/>"what's the row with you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="959" id="dominics.c0.p959"><s>"Sprained my wrist," said Loman, to whom, alas!--so easy is the downward path when once entered on--a lie had become an easy thing to utter.</s> </p>

<p pid="960" id="dominics.c0.p960"><s>"How did you manage that?" exclaimed Callonby.</s> <s>"Mind you get it right by to-morrow, or we _shall_ be in a fix."</s> </p>

<p pid="961" id="dominics.c0.p961" type="speech"><s>This little piece of flattery pleased Loman, who said, <qs/>"I'm afraid I shan't be able to play."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="962" id="dominics.c0.p962"><s>"What!</s> <s>Who's that won't be able to play?" said Raleigh, coming up in unwonted excitement.</s> </p>

<p pid="963" id="dominics.c0.p963"><s>"Loman; he's sprained his wrist."</s> </p>

<p pid="964" id="dominics.c0.p964"><s>"Have you shown it to Dr Splints?" said Raleigh.</s> </p>

<p pid="965" id="dominics.c0.p965"><s>"No," said Loman, beginning to feel uncomfortable.</s> <s>"It's hardly bad enough for that."</s> </p>

<p pid="966" id="dominics.c0.p966"><s>"Then it's hardly bad enough to prevent your playing," said Raleigh, drily.</s> </p>

<p pid="967" id="dominics.c0.p967"><s>Loman did not like this.</s> <s>He and Raleigh never got on well together, and it was evident the captain was more angry than sympathetic now.</s> </p>

<p pid="968" id="dominics.c0.p968"><s>"Whatever shall we do for bowlers?" said some one.</s> </p>

<p pid="969" id="dominics.c0.p969" type="speech"><s>"I'm awfully sorry," said Loman, wishing he was anywhere but where he was; <qs/>"but how am I to help?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="970" id="dominics.c0.p970"><s>"Whatever induced you to sprain your wrist?" said Wren.</s> <s>"You might just as well have put it off till Monday."</s> </p>

<p pid="971" id="dominics.c0.p971"><s>"Just fancy how foolish we shall look if those young beggars beat us, as they are almost sure to do," said Winter.</s> </p>

<p pid="972" id="dominics.c0.p972"><s>Loman was quickly losing his temper, for all this was, or seemed to be, addressed pointedly to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="973" id="dominics.c0.p973"><s>"What's the use of talking like that?" he retorted.</s> <s>"You ass, you! as if I could help."</s> </p>

<p pid="974" id="dominics.c0.p974"><s>"Shouldn't wonder if you could help," replied Winter.</s> </p>

<p pid="975" id="dominics.c0.p975" type="speech"><s>"Perhaps," suggested some one, <qs/>"it was the _Dominican_ put him out of joint.</s> <s>It certainly did give him a rap over the knuckles."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="976" id="dominics.c0.p976"><s>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Loman, angrily, and half drawing his supposed sprained hand out of the sling.</s> </p>

<p pid="977" id="dominics.c0.p977"><s>"Shut up, you fellows," interposed Raleigh, authoritatively.</s> <s>"Baynes will play in the eleven to-morrow instead of Loman, so there's an end of the matter."</s> </p>

<p pid="978" id="dominics.c0.p978"><s>Loman was sorely mortified.</s> <s>He had expected his defection would create quite a sensation, and that his class-fellows would be inconsolable at his accident.</s> <s>Instead of that, he had only contrived to quarrel with nearly all of them, alienating their sympathy; and in the end he was to be quietly superseded by Baynes, and the match was to go on as if he had never been heard of at Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="979" id="dominics.c0.p979" type="speech"><s>"Never mind; I'm bound to go and see Cripps.</s> <s>Besides," said he to himself, <qs/>"they'll miss me to-morrow, whatever they say to-day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="980" id="dominics.c0.p980"><s>Next day, just when the great match was beginning, and the entire school was hanging breathless on the issue of every ball, Loman quietly slipped out of Saint Dominic's, and walked rapidly and nervously down to the Cockchafer in Maltby.</s> </p>

<p pid="981" id="dominics.c0.p981"><s>"What _shall_ I say to Cripps?" was the wild question he kept asking himself as he went along; and the answer had not come by the time he found himself standing within that worthy's respectable premises.</s> </p>

<p pid="986" id="dominics.c0.p986"><s>"Did I?</s> <s>Ah, I dare say!</s> <s>Never mind.</s> <s>Very kind of a young gentleman like you to come and see the likes of me.</s> <s>What'll you take?"</s> </p>

<p pid="987" id="dominics.c0.p987"><s>Loman did not know what to make of this at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="988" id="dominics.c0.p988"><s>"I came to see you about that--that horse you told me to bet against," he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="989" id="dominics.c0.p989"><s>"I remember.</s> <s>What's his name?</s> <s>Sir Patrick, wasn't it?</s> <s>My friend told me that he'd had the best of that.</s> <s>What was it?</s> <s>Ten bob?"</s> </p>

<p pid="990" id="dominics.c0.p990"><s>This affected ignorance of the whole matter in hand was utterly bewildering to Loman, who had fully expected that, instead of having to explain himself, he would have the matter pretty plainly explained to him by his sportive acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="991" id="dominics.c0.p991"><s>"No, ten pounds.</s> <s>That was what I was to pay if the horse won; and, Cripps, I can't pay it, or the twenty pounds either, to you."</s> </p>

<p pid="993" id="dominics.c0.p993"><s>"That's a go and no mistake!" he said.</s> <s>"Afraid it won't do, mister."</s> </p>

<p pid="994" id="dominics.c0.p994"><s>"You told me Sir Patrick was sure not to win," said Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="995" id="dominics.c0.p995"><s>"Ah, there was several of us took in over that there horse," coolly said Mr Cripps.</s> <s>"I lost a shilling myself over him.</s> <s>Nice to be you, flush of cash, and able to pay straight down."</s> </p>

<p pid="1019" id="dominics.c0.p1019"><s>"Well, blessed if I ain't a easy-going cove," said Mr Cripps, with a grin.</s> <s>"It ain't every one as 'ud wait three months on your poll-parrot scholarships, or whatever you call 'em.</s> <s>Come, business is business.</s> <s>Give us your promise on a piece of paper--if you must impose upon me."</s> <s>Loman, only too delighted, wrote at Mr Cripps's dictation a promise to pay the thirty pounds, together with five pounds interest, in September, and quitted the Cockchafer with as light a heart as if he had actually paid off every penny of the debt.</s> </p>

<p pid="1020" id="dominics.c0.p1020"><s>"Of course I'm safe to get it!</s> <s>Why ever didn't I think of that before?</s> <s>Won't I just work the rest of the term!</s> <s>Nothing like having an object when you're grinding."</s> </p>

<p pid="1021" id="dominics.c0.p1021"><s>With this philosophical reflection he re-entered Saint Dominic's, and unobserved rejoined the spectators in the cricket-field, just in time to witness a very exciting finish to a fiercely contested encounter.</s> </p>

<p pid="1022" id="dominics.c0.p1022"><s>CHAPTER FOURTEEN.</s> <s>SIXTH VERSUS SCHOOL.</s> </p>

<p pid="1023" id="dominics.c0.p1023"><s>Never had a Sixth versus School Match been looked forward to with more excitement at Saint Dominic's than the present one.</s> <s>Party feeling had been running high all the term, intensified on the one hand by the unpopularity of some of the monitors, and on the other by the defiant attitude of the Fifth and the tone of their organ, the _Dominican_.</s> </p>

<p pid="1024" id="dominics.c0.p1024"><s>The lower school naturally looked on with interest at this rivalry between the two head forms, the result of which, as might have been expected, was the reverse of beneficial for the discipline of the school generally.</s> <s>If the big boys set a bad example and disregard rules, what can one expect of the little ones?</s> </p>

<p pid="1025" id="dominics.c0.p1025"><s>So far, anything like conflict had been avoided.</s> <s>The Fifth had "cheeked" the Sixth, and the Sixth had snubbed the Fifth; but with the exception of Loman's assault on Oliver, which had not led to a fight, the war had been strictly one of words.</s> <s>Now, however, the opposing forces were to be ranged face to face at cricket; and to the junior school the opportunity seemed a grand one for a display of partisanship one side or the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="1026" id="dominics.c0.p1026"><s>The School Eleven, on this occasion, moreover, consisted exclusively of Fifth Form boys--a most unusual circumstance, and one which seemed to be the result quite as much of management as of accident.</s> <s>At least so said the disappointed heroes of the Fourth.</s> </p>

<p pid="1027" id="dominics.c0.p1027"><s>The match was, in fact--whatever it was formally styled--a match between the Sixth and the Fifth, and the partisans of either side looked upon it as a decisive event in the respective glories of the two top forms.</s> </p>

<p pid="1028" id="dominics.c0.p1028"><s>And now the day had come.</s> <s>All Saint Dominic's trooped out to the meadows, and there was a rush of small boys as usual for the front benches.</s> <s>Stephen found himself along with his trusty ally, Paul, and his equally trusty enemy, Bramble, and some ten other Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, wedged like sardines upon a form that would comfortably hold six, eagerly canvassing the prospects of the struggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="1029" id="dominics.c0.p1029"><s>"The Sixth are going to win in a single innings, if you fellows want to know," announced Bramble, with all the authority of one who knows.</s> </p>

<p pid="1030" id="dominics.c0.p1030"><s>"Not a bit of it," replied Paul.</s> <s>"The Fifth are safe to win, I tell you."</s> </p>

<p pid="1031" id="dominics.c0.p1031"><s>"But they've got no decent bowlers," said Raddleston.</s> </p>

<p pid="1032" id="dominics.c0.p1032"><s>"Never mind," said Stephen.</s> <s>"Loman's not going to play for the Sixth.</s> <s>He's sprained his wrist."</s> </p>

<p pid="1033" id="dominics.c0.p1033" type="speech"><s>"Hip, hip, hurrah?" yelled Paul, <qs/>"that _is_ jolly!</s> <s>They are sure to be licked now.</s> <s>Are you sure he's out of it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1034" id="dominics.c0.p1034"><s>"Yes.</s> <s>Look at him there with his arm in a sling."</s> </p>

<p pid="1035" id="dominics.c0.p1035"><s>And Stephen pointed to where Loman stood in his ordinary clothes talking to some of his fellows.</s> </p>

<p pid="1036" id="dominics.c0.p1036"><s>"Well, that _is_ a piece of luck!" said Paul.</s> <s>"Who's to take his place?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1037" id="dominics.c0.p1037"><s>"Baynes, they say.</s> <s>He's no use, though."</s> </p>

<p pid="1038" id="dominics.c0.p1038"><s>"Don't you be too cock-sure, you two," growled Bramble.</s> <s>"I say we shall beat you even if Loman don't play.</s> <s>Got any brandy-balls left, Greenfield?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1039" id="dominics.c0.p1039"><s>Similar speculations and hopes were being exchanged all round the field, and when at last the Fifth went out to field, and Callonby and Wren went in to bat for the Sixth, you might have heard a cat sneeze, so breathless was the excitement.</s> </p>

<p pid="1040" id="dominics.c0.p1040"><s>Amid solemn silence the first few balls were bowled.</s> <s>The third ball of the first over came straight on to Wren's bat, who played it neatly back to the bowler.</s> <s>It was not a run, only a simple block; but it was the first play of the match, and so quite enough to loosen the tongues of all the small boys, who yelled, and howled, and cheered as frantically as if a six had been run or a wicket taken.</s> <s>And the ice once broken, every ball and every hit were marked and applauded as if empires depended on them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1041" id="dominics.c0.p1041"><s>It was in the midst of this gradually rising excitement that Loman slipped quietly and unobserved from the scene, and betook himself to the errand on which we accompanied him in the preceding chapter.</s> </p>

<p pid="1042" id="dominics.c0.p1042"><s>The two Sixth men went quickly to work, and at the end of the second over had scored eight.</s> <s>Then Callonby, in stepping back to "draw" one of Wraysford's balls, knocked down his wicket.</s> </p>

<p pid="1043" id="dominics.c0.p1043"><s>How the small boys yelled at this!</s> </p>

<p pid="1044" id="dominics.c0.p1044"><s>But the sight of Raleigh going in second soon silenced them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1045" id="dominics.c0.p1045"><s>"They mean hard work by sending in the captain now," said Paul.</s> <s>"I don't like that!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1046" id="dominics.c0.p1046"><s>"No more do I," said Stephen.</s> <s>"He always knocks Oliver's bowling about."</s> </p>

<p pid="1047" id="dominics.c0.p1047"><s>"Oh, bother; is your brother bowling?" said Master Paul, quite unconscious of wounding any one's feelings.</s> <s>"It's a pity they've got no one better."</s> </p>

<p pid="1048" id="dominics.c0.p1048"><s>Stephen coloured up at this, and wondered what made Paul such a horrid boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1049" id="dominics.c0.p1049"><s>"Better look-out for your eyes," said Bramble, cheerily.</s> <s>"The captain always knocks up this way, over square-leg's head."</s> </p>

<p pid="1050" id="dominics.c0.p1050"><s>There was a general buzz of youngsters round the field, as the hero of the school walked up to the wicket, and coolly turned to face Oliver's bowling.</s> </p>

<p pid="1051" id="dominics.c0.p1051"><s>The scorer in the tent hurriedly sharpened his pencil.</s> <s>The big fellows, who had been standing up to watch the opening overs, sat down on the grass and made themselves comfortable.</s> <s>Something was going to happen, evidently.</s> <s>The captain was in, and meant business.</s> </p>

<p pid="1052" id="dominics.c0.p1052"><s>Oliver gripped the ball hard in his hand, and walked back to the end of his run.</s> <s>"Play!" cried the umpire, and amid dead silence the ball shot from the bowler's hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1053" id="dominics.c0.p1053"><s>Next moment there rose a shout loud enough to deafen all Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>The ball was flying fifty feet up in the air, and Raleigh was slowly walking, bat in hand, back to the tent he had only a moment ago quitted!</s> </p>

<p pid="1054" id="dominics.c0.p1054"><s>The captain had been clean bowled, first ball!</s> </p>

<p pid="1055" id="dominics.c0.p1055"><s>Who shall describe the excitement, the yelling, the cheering, the consternation that followed?</s> <s>Paul got up and danced a hornpipe on the bench; Bramble kicked the boy nearest to him.</s> <s>"Well bowled, sir!" shouted some.</s> <s>"Hard lines!" screamed others.</s> <s>"Hurrah for the Fifth!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1056" id="dominics.c0.p1056"><s>"You'll beat them yet, Sixth!" such were a few of the shouts audible above the general clamour.</s> </p>

<p pid="1057" id="dominics.c0.p1057"><s>As for Stephen, he was wild with joy.</s> <s>He was a staunch partisan of the Fifth in any case, but that was nothing to the fact that it was _his_ brother, his own brother and nobody else's, who had bowled that eventful ball, and who was at that moment the hero of Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>Stephen felt as proud and elated as if he had bowled the ball himself, and could afford to be absolutely patronising to those around him, on the head of this achievement.</s> </p>

<p pid="1058" id="dominics.c0.p1058"><s>"That wasn't a bad ball of Oliver's," he said to Paul.</s> <s>"He can bowl very well when he tries."</s> </p>

<p pid="1059" id="dominics.c0.p1059"><s>"It was a beastly fluke!" roared Bramble, determined to see no merit in the exploit.</s> </p>

<p pid="1060" id="dominics.c0.p1060"><s>"Shut up and don't make a row," said Stephen, with a bland smile of forgiveness.</s> </p>

<p pid="1061" id="dominics.c0.p1061"><s>Bramble promised his adversary to shut _him_ up, and after a little more discussion and altercation and jubilation, the excitement subsided, and another man went in.</s> <s>All this while the Fifth were in ecstasies.</s> <s>They controlled their feelings, however, contenting themselves with clapping Oliver on the back till he was nearly dead, and speculating on the chances of beating their adversaries in a single innings.</s> </p>

<p pid="1062" id="dominics.c0.p1062"><s>But they had not won the match yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1063" id="dominics.c0.p1063"><s>Winter was next man in, and he and Wren fell to work very speedily in a decidedly business-like way.</s> <s>No big hits were made, but the score crawled up by ones and twos steadily, and the longer they were at it the steadier they played.</s> <s>Loud cheers announced the posting of thirty on the signal-board, but still the score went on.</s> <s>Now it was a slip, now a bye, now a quiet cut.</s> </p>

<p pid="1064" id="dominics.c0.p1064"><s>"Bravo! well played!" cried Raleigh and his men frequently.</s> <s>The captain, by the way, was in excellent spirits, despite his misfortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="1065" id="dominics.c0.p1065"><s>Thirty-five, forty!</s> <s>The Fifth began to look hot and puzzled.</s> <s>The batsmen were evidently far too much at home with the bowling.</s> <s>A change must be made, even though it be to put on only a second-rate bowler.</s> </p>

<p pid="1066" id="dominics.c0.p1066"><s>Tom Senior was put on.</s> <s>He was nothing like as good a bowler as either Wraysford, or Oliver, or Ricketts.</s> <s>He bowled a very ordinary slow lob, without either twist or shoot, and was usually knocked about plentifully; and this appeared likely to be his fate now, for Wren got hold of his first ball, and knocked it right over into the scorer's tent for five.</s> <s>The Fifth groaned, and could have torn the wretched Tom to pieces.</s> <s>But the next ball was more lucky; Winter hit it, indeed, but he hit it up, sky-high, over the bowler's head, and before it reached the ground Bullinger was safe underneath it.</s> <s>It was with a sigh of relief that the Fifth saw this awkward partnership broken up.</s> <s>The score was at forty-eight for three wickets; quite enough too!</s> </p>

<p pid="1067" id="dominics.c0.p1067"><s>After this the innings progressed more evenly.</s> <s>Men came in and went out more as usual, each contributing his three or four, and one or two their ten or twelve.</s> <s>Among the latter was Baynes, who, at the last moment, it will be remembered, had been put into the eleven to replace Loman.</s> <s>By careful play he managed to put together ten, greatly to his own delight, and not a little to the surprise of his friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="1068" id="dominics.c0.p1068"><s>In due time the last wicket of the Sixth fell, to a total of eighty-four runs.</s> </p>

<p pid="1069" id="dominics.c0.p1069"><s>The small boys on the bench had had leisure to abate their ardour by this time.</s> <s>Bramble had recovered his spirits, and Paul and Stephen looked a little blue as they saw the total signalled.</s> </p>

<p pid="1070" id="dominics.c0.p1070"><s>"Eighty-four's a lot," said Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="1071" id="dominics.c0.p1071"><s>Paul nodded glumly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1072" id="dominics.c0.p1072"><s>"Ya, ha!</s> <s>How do you like it, Guinea-pigs?" jeered Bramble.</s> <s>"I hope _you'll_ get half as much.</s> <s>_I_ knew how it would be."</s> </p>

<p pid="1073" id="dominics.c0.p1073"><s>The two friends listened to these taunts in silent sorrow, and wished the next innings would begin.</s> </p>

<p pid="1074" id="dominics.c0.p1074" type="speech"><s>It did presently, and not very brilliantly either.</s> <s>The Fifth only managed to score fifty-one, and to this total Wraysford was the only player who made anything like good scoring.</s> <s>Oliver got out for six, Ricketts for nine, and Tom Senior and Braddy both for a <qs/>"duck's-egg."<qe/></s> <s>Altogether it was a meagre performance, and things looked very gloomy for the Fifth when, for a second time, their adversaries took the wickets.</s> </p>

<p pid="1075" id="dominics.c0.p1075"><s>Things never turn out at cricket as one expects, however, and the second innings of the Sixth was no exception to the rule.</s> <s>They only made thirty-six runs.</s> <s>Stephen and Paul were hoarse with yelling, as first one wicket, then another, went down for scarcely a run.</s> <s>Raleigh and Baynes seemed the only two who could stand up at all to the bowling of Oliver and Wraysford, but even their efforts could not keep the wickets up for long.</s> </p>

<p pid="1076" id="dominics.c0.p1076"><s>Every one saw now that the final innings would be a desperate struggle.</s> <s>The Fifth wanted sixty-nine to be equal and seventy to win, and the question was, Would they do it in time?</s> </p>

<p pid="1077" id="dominics.c0.p1077"><s>Stephen and his confederate felt the weight of this question so oppressive that they left the irritating company of Mr Bramble, and walked off and joined themselves to a group of Fourth Form fellows, who were watching the match with sulky interest, evidently sore that they had none of their men in the School Eleven.</s> </p>

<p pid="1078" id="dominics.c0.p1078"><s>"They'll never do it, and serve them right!" said one.</s> <s>"Why didn't they put Mansfield in the eleven, or Banks?</s> <s>They're far more use than Fisher or Braddy."</s> </p>

<p pid="1079" id="dominics.c0.p1079"><s>"For all that, it'll be a sell if the Sixth lick," said another.</s> </p>

<p pid="1080" id="dominics.c0.p1080"><s>"I wouldn't much care.</s> <s>If we are going to be sat upon by those Fifth snobs every time an eleven is made up, it's quite time we did go in with the Sixth."</s> </p>

<p pid="1081" id="dominics.c0.p1081" type="speech"><s>"Jolly for the Sixth!" retorted the other; whereupon Stephen laughed, and had his ears boxed for being cheeky.</s> <s>The Fourth Senior could not stand <qs/>"cheek."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1082" id="dominics.c0.p1082"><s>But Saint Dominic's generally was "sweet" on the Fifth, and hoped they would win.</s> <s>When, therefore, Tom Senior and Bullinger went in first and began to score there was great rejoicing.</s> </p>

<p pid="1083" id="dominics.c0.p1083"><s>But the Fourth Form fellows, among whom Stephen now was, refused to cheer for any one; criticism was more in their line.</s> </p>

<p pid="1084" id="dominics.c0.p1084"><s>"Did you ever see a fellow hit across wickets more horribly than Senior?" said one.</s> </p>

<p pid="1085" id="dominics.c0.p1085"><s>"Just look at that!" cried another.</s> <s>"That Bullinger's a downright muff not to get that last ball to leg!</s> <s>I could have got it easily."</s> </p>

<p pid="1086" id="dominics.c0.p1086"><s>"Well, with that bowling, it's a disgrace if they _don't_ score; that's all I can say," remarked a third.</s> </p>

<p pid="1087" id="dominics.c0.p1087"><s>And so these Fourth Form grandees went on, much to Stephen's wrath, who, when Oliver went in, removed somewhere else, so as to be out of ear-shot of any offensive remarks.</s> </p>

<p pid="1088" id="dominics.c0.p1088"><s>Oliver, however, played so well that even the Fourth Form critics could hardly run him down.</s> <s>He survived all the other wickets of his side, and, though not making a brilliant score, did what was almost as useful--played steadily, and gradually demoralised the bowling of the enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1089" id="dominics.c0.p1089"><s>As the game went on the excitement increased rapidly; and when at length the ninth wicket went down for sixty-one, and the last man in appeared, with nine to win, the eagerness on both sides scarcely knew bounds.</s> <s>Every ball, every piece of fielding, was cheered by one side, and every hit and every piece of play was as vehemently cheered by the other.</s> <s>If Raleigh and Wren had been nervous bowlers, they would undoubtedly have been disconcerted by the dead silence, followed by terrific applause, amid which every ball--even a wide--was delivered.</s> <s>But happily they were not.</s> </p>

<p pid="1090" id="dominics.c0.p1090"><s>It was at this critical juncture that Loman reappeared on the scene, much consoled to have the interview with Cripps over, and quite ready now to hear every one lament his absence from the match.</s> </p>

<p pid="1091" id="dominics.c0.p1091"><s>The last man in was Webster, a small Fifth boy, who in the last innings had signalised himself by making a duck's-egg.</s> <s>The Fifth scarcely dared hope he would stay in long enough for the nine runs required to be made, and looked on now almost pale with anxiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="1092" id="dominics.c0.p1092" type="speech"><s>"Now," said Pembury, near whom Loman, as well as our two Guinea-pigs, found themselves, <qs/>"it all depends on Oliver, and I back Oliver to do it, don't you, Loamy?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1093" id="dominics.c0.p1093" type="speech"><s>Loman, who since the last _Dominican_ had not been on speaking terms with Pembury, did not vouchsafe a reply, <qs/>"I do!"<qe/> said Stephen, boldly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1152" id="dominics.c0.p1152"><s>The Junior "cricket feast" was an institution in Saint Dominic's, and was an occasion when any one who had nerves to be excruciated or ear-drums to be broken took care to keep out of the way.</s> <s>In place of the usual desks and forms, a long table ran down the room, round which some fifty or sixty urchins sat, regaling themselves with what was left of a vast spread of plum-cake, buns, and ginger-beer.</s> <s>How these banquets were provided was always a mystery to outsiders.</s> <s>Some said a levy of threepence a head was made; others, that every boy was bound in honour to contribute something eatable to the feast; and others averred that every boy had to bring his own bag and bottle, and no more.</s> <s>Be that as it might, the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles at present assembled looked uncommonly tight about the jackets after it all, and not one had the appearance of actual starvation written on his lineaments.</s> </p>

<p pid="1154" id="dominics.c0.p1154"><s>The chairman, by the way, was no other than our friend Bramble, who by reason of seniority--he had been two years in the Fourth Junior, and showed no signs of rising higher all his life--claimed to preside on all such occasions.</s> <s>He sat up at the top end in stately glory, higher than the rest by the thickness of a Liddell and Scott, which was placed on his chair to lift him up to the required elevation, blushingly receiving the applause with which his song was greeted, and modestly volunteering to sing it again if the fellows liked.</s> </p>

<p pid="1155" id="dominics.c0.p1155" type="speech"><s>The fellows did like.</s> <s>Mr Bramble mounted once more on to the seat of his chair, and saying, <qs/>"Look-out for the chorus!"<qe/> began one of the time-honoured Dominican cricket songs.</s> <s>It consisted of about twelve verses altogether, but three will be quite enough for the reader.</s> </p>

<p pid="1156" id="dominics.c0.p1156"><s>"There was a little lad, (Well bowled!)</s> <s>And a little bat he had; (Well bowled!)</s> <s>He skipped up to the wicket, And thought he'd play some cricket, But he didn't, for he was-- Well bowled!</s> </p>

<p pid="1159" id="dominics.c0.p1159"><s>The virtue of the pathetic ballad was in the chorus, which was usually not sung, but spoken, and so presented a noble opportunity for variety of tone and expression, which was greedily seized upon by the riotous young gentlemen into whose mouths it was entrusted.</s> <s>By the time the sad adventures of Master Walker had been rehearsed in all their twelve verses, the meeting was so hoarse that to the two elder boys it seemed as if the proceedings must necessarily come abruptly to a close for want of voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="1160" id="dominics.c0.p1160"><s>But no!</s> <s>If the meeting was for the moment incapable of song, speech was yet possible and behold there arose Master Paul in his place to propose a toast.</s> </p>

<p pid="1166" id="dominics.c0.p1166"><s>Meanwhile Stephen heard his name suddenly called upon for a song, an invitation he promptly obeyed.</s> <s>But as the clamour was at the time deafening, and the attention of the audience was wholly monopolised by the commercial transactions taking place between Paul and Spicer, the effect of the performance was somewhat lost.</s> <s>Oliver certainly did see his young brother mount up on the table, turn very red in the face, open his mouth and shut it, smile in one part, look sorrowful in another, and wave his hand above his head in another.</s> <s>But that was the only intimation he had of a musical performance proceeding.</s> <s>Words and tune were utterly inaudible by any one except the singer himself--even if _he_ heard them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1273" id="dominics.c0.p1273"><s>Padger suggested that young Greenfield might possibly have to have his cheek cut off if he didn't look-out, and Paul said the sooner he "stashed his cheek" the better.</s> </p>

<p pid="1274" id="dominics.c0.p1274"><s>The result of this friendly and witty conference was that Stephen took it into his head to cure his cheek, and to that end applied for leave from Mr Rastle to go down that afternoon to Maltby to get something from the chemist.</s> </p>

<p pid="1341" id="dominics.c0.p1341"><s>And then, to Bramble's utter despair and to the terror of all the other unprofitable members of the class, the Doctor proceeded to catechise sharply the unhappy youth on his general knowledge of the subjects taught during the term.</s> </p>

<p pid="1342" id="dominics.c0.p1342"><s>As might be expected, the exhibition was a miserable one; Bramble was found wanting in every particular.</s> <s>The simplest questions could hardly coax a correct answer out of him, whereas an ordinary inquiry was hopelessly beyond his powers.</s> <s>He mixed up William the Conqueror and William of Orange; he subtracted what ought to be multiplied, and floundered about between conjunctions and prepositions in a sickening way.</s> <s>The Doctor did not spare him.</s> <s>He went ruthlessly on--exposing the boy's ignorance, first in one thing, then another.</s> <s>Bramble stood and trembled and perspired before him, and wished he was dead, but the questions still came on.</s> <s>If he had answered a single thing correctly it would have been a different matter, but he knew nothing.</s> <s>I believe he did know what twice two was, but that was the one question the Doctor did not ask him.</s> <s>As to French, Latin, Grammar, and Euclid, the clock on the wall knew as much of them as Bramble.</s> <s>It came to an end at last.</s> </p>

<p pid="1343" id="dominics.c0.p1343" type="speech"><s>"Come here, Bramble," said the Doctor, gravely; <qs/>"and come here, you, and you, and you,"<qe/> added he, pointing to Stephen and Paul and four or five others of the party who had been reading the _Dominican_ that morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="1344" id="dominics.c0.p1344"><s>The luckless youngsters obeyed, and when they stood in a row before the dreaded Doctor, the bottom form and half of the bottom form but one were empty.</s> </p>

<p pid="1345" id="dominics.c0.p1345" type="speech"><s>"Now, you boys," began the head master, very gravely, <qs/>"I hadn't intended to examine you to-day; but, from something I heard one of you say, I felt rather anxious to know how some of you are doing in your studies.</s> <s>These half-dozen boys I was particularly anxious to know of, because I heard them talking to-day as if they were the most important boys in the whole school.</s> <s>They _are_ the most important; for they are the most ignorant, and require, and in future will receive, the closest looking after.</s> <s>You, little boys,"<qe/><sls/> said the Doctor, turning to the row of abashed culprits, <sle/><qs/>"take a word of warning from me.</s> <s>Do not be silly as well as dunces.</s> <s>Do not think, as long as you know least of any one in the school you can pretend to rule the school.</s> <s>I hope some of you have been led to see to-day you are not as clever as you would like to be.</s> <s>If you try, and work hard, and stick like men to your lessons, you will know more than you do now; and when you do know more you will see that the best way for little boys to get on is not by giving themselves ridiculous airs, but by doing their duty steadily in class, and living at peace with one another, and submitting quietly to the discipline of the school.</s> <s>Don't let me hear any more of this recent nonsense.</s> <s>You'll be going off in a day or two for the holidays.</s> <s>Take my advice, and think over what I have said; and next term let me see you in your right minds, determined to work hard and do your part honestly for the credit of the good old school.</s> <s>Go to your places, boys."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1346" id="dominics.c0.p1346"><s>And so the Doctor's visitation came to an end.</s> <s>It made a very deep impression on the youthful members of the Fourth Junior.</s> <s>Most of them felt very much ashamed of themselves; and nearly every one felt his veneration and admiration for the Doctor greatly heightened.</s> <s>Only a few incorrigibles like Bramble professed to make light of the scene through which they had just passed, and even he, it was evident, was considerably chastened by his experience.</s> </p>

<p pid="1347" id="dominics.c0.p1347"><s>That evening, after the first bed-bell, Dr Senior requested some of the masters to meet with him for a few minutes in his study.</s> </p>

<p pid="1351" id="dominics.c0.p1351"><s>"I have," said Mr Rastle.</s> <s>"It seems to me to be cleverly managed, though perhaps a little personal."</s> </p>

<p pid="1352" id="dominics.c0.p1352"><s>"Ah, only natural with schoolboys," said the Doctor.</s> <s>"I should like to see it.</s> <s>Can you fetch it, Rastle?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1353" id="dominics.c0.p1353" type="speech"><s>"It is nailed to the wall," said Mr Rastle, smiling, <qs/>"like Luther's manifesto; but I can get one of the boys, I dare say, to unfasten it for you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1354" id="dominics.c0.p1354"><s>"No, do not do that," said the Doctor.</s> <s>"If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, you know, Mahomet and his disciples must go to the mountain, eh, Mr Harrison?</s> <s>I think we might venture out and peruse it where it hangs."</s> <s>So half-stealthily, when the whole school was falling asleep, Dr Senior and his colleagues stepped out into the passage, and by the aid of a candle satisfied their curiosity as to the mysterious _Dominican_.</s> </p>

<p pid="1355" id="dominics.c0.p1355"><s>A good deal of its humour was, of course, lost upon them, as they could hardly be expected to understand the force of all the allusions it contained.</s> <s>But they saw quite enough to enable them to gather the general tenor of the paper; it amused and it concerned them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1356" id="dominics.c0.p1356" type="speech"><s>"It shows considerable ability on the part of its editor," said the Doctor, after the masters had returned to his study, <qs/>"but I rather fear its tone may give offence to some of the boys--in the Sixth for instance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1357" id="dominics.c0.p1357"><s>"I fancy there is a considerable amount of rivalry between the two head forms," said Mr Harrison.</s> </p>

<p pid="1360" id="dominics.c0.p1360" type="speech"><s>"Ah," said the Doctor, smiling, <qs/>"about that `strike.'</s> <s>I can't understand that.</s> <s>Really the politics of your little world, Rastle, are too intricate for any ordinary mortal.</s> <s>But I gather the small boys have a grievance against the big ones?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1361" id="dominics.c0.p1361"><s>"Yes, on the question of fagging, I believe."</s> </p>

<p pid="1362" id="dominics.c0.p1362"><s>"Oh!" said the Doctor.</s> <s>"I hope that is not coming up.</s> <s>You know I'm heretic enough to believe that a certain amount of fagging does not do harm in a school like ours."</s> </p>

<p pid="1363" id="dominics.c0.p1363"><s>"Certainly not," said Mr Jellicott.</s> <s>"But these small boys are really very amusing.</s> <s>They appear to be regularly organised, and some of them have quite a martyr spirit about them."</s> </p>

<p pid="1364" id="dominics.c0.p1364"><s>"As I can testify," said Mr Rastle, proceeding to recount the case of Stephen Greenfield and his sore cheek.</s> <s>The Doctor listened to it all, half gravely, half amused, and presently said:</s> </p>

<p pid="1365" id="dominics.c0.p1365"><s>"Well, it is as well the holidays are coming.</s> <s>Things are sure to calm down in them; and next term I dare say we shall be all the wiser for the lessons of this.</s> <s>Meanwhile I should like to see the editor of this paper to-morrow.</s> <s>Who is he, Jellicott?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1370" id="dominics.c0.p1370"><s>Anthony, with rather a long face, retired from the Doctor's presence.</s> </p>

<p pid="1371" id="dominics.c0.p1371"><s>A few days later the school broke up for the summer holidays.</s> </p>

<p pid="1372" id="dominics.c0.p1372"><s>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.</s> <s>A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.</s> </p>

<p pid="1373" id="dominics.c0.p1373"><s>When a big school like Saint Dominic's is gathered together within the comparatively narrow compass of four walls, there _is_ some possibility of ascertaining how it prospers, and what events are interesting it.</s> <s>But when the same school is scattered to the four winds of heaven during the holidays, it would require a hundred eyes and more to follow its movements.</s> </p>

<p pid="1374" id="dominics.c0.p1374" type="speech"><s>It would be impossible, for instance, at one and the same time to accompany Raleigh and his sisters up Snowdon, and look on at Bramble catching crabs on the rocks at Broadstairs; nor, while we follow Dr Senior among the peaks and passes of Switzerland (and remark, by the way, what a nice quiet boy Tom Senior is, when he has only his father and his mother to tempt him into mischief) can we possibly expect to regard very attentively the doings of Simon, as he gapes about before the London shop-windows, and jerks off a score or more stanzas of his <qs/>"Hart's Earnings,"<qe/> which is now about a quarter done.</s> </p>

<p pid="1375" id="dominics.c0.p1375"><s>So the reader must imagine how most of the boys spent their holidays, how they enjoyed them, and how they behaved themselves during the period, and be content to be told only about two groups of holiday-makers, about whom, as they are destined to figure pretty conspicuously in next term's doings at Saint Dominic's, it will be interesting to hear rather more particularly now.</s> </p>

<p pid="1376" id="dominics.c0.p1376" type="speech"><s>And the first group--if we can call a single person a <qs/>"group"<qe/>--is Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="1377" id="dominics.c0.p1377"><s>Loman began his holidays in anything but cheerful spirits.</s> <s>No one had seemed particularly sorry to say good-bye to him at Saint Dominic's, and a good many had been unmistakably glad.</s> <s>And he had quite enough on his mind, apart from this, to make his home-coming far less joyous than it might have been.</s> <s>It ought to have been the happiest event possible, for he was coming home to parents who loved him, friends who were glad to see him, and a home where every comfort and pleasure was within his reach.</s> <s>Few boys, indeed, were more blessed than Loman with all the advantages of a Christian and happy home; and few boys could have failed to return to such a home after a long absence without delight.</s> <s>But to Loman, these holidays, the surroundings of home afforded very little pleasure.</s> <s>His mind was ill at ease.</s> <s>The burden of debt was upon him, and the burden of suspense.</s> <s>He had tried hard to assure himself that all would come right--that he would certainly win the scholarship, and so wipe off the debt; but his confidence became less and less comfortable as time went on.</s> </p>

<p pid="1378" id="dominics.c0.p1378"><s>He dared not tell his troubles to his father, for he feared his upbraiding; and he would not confess them to his mother, for she, he knew, would tell all to his father.</s> <s>He still clung to the hope that all would come right in the end; and then what would have been gained by telling his parents all about it?</s> </p>

<p pid="1379" id="dominics.c0.p1379"><s>The one thing was hard work--and Loman came home determined to work.</s> <s>His parents saw him out of spirits, and were concerned.</s> <s>They did what they could to cheer him, but without much success.</s> </p>

<p pid="1380" id="dominics.c0.p1380" type="speech"><s>"Come, Edward, put away your books to-day," his mother would say; <qs/>"I want you to drive me over to Falkham in the pony-chaise."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1387" id="dominics.c0.p1387"><s>"Coming to see me!" exclaimed Loman, horrified.</s> <s>"I say, Cripps, you mustn't do that.</s> <s>My father would be very angry, you know."</s> </p>

<p pid="1411" id="dominics.c0.p1411"><s>They were to take a tent with them, and cooking utensils, so as to be quite independent of inns, and each voyager was to contribute his share of provender.</s> <s>Quite a Robinson Crusoe business, even down to the desert island, for on desert islands the boys had declared they intended every night to take up their quarters, and, come hail, snow, or lightning, there to sleep under their waterproof tent.</s> </p>

<p pid="1412" id="dominics.c0.p1412"><s>Mrs Greenfield didn't half like the idea, and became very pathetic on the subject of ague and rheumatic fever.</s> <s>But the boys carried the day by promising faithfully that they would catch neither malady.</s> <s>The looked-for day came at last, and to Oxford they went, where the familiar sight of Wraysford, in boating costume, at the railway station still further elated their high spirits.</s> <s>The boat was ready.</s> <s>The tent, the provender, the blankets, were snugly stowed away on board.</s> <s>The weather was fine, the river was charming, everything promised well; and punctually that Monday afternoon the three adventurers loosed from their moorings and turned the nose of their boat towards London.</s> </p>

<p pid="1414" id="dominics.c0.p1414" type="speech"><s>They were coming near the end of their cruise.</s> <s>They had paddled down past the magnificent woods of Cliveden, and under the pretty bridge of Maidenhead; they had watched the boys bathing at <qs/>"Athens,"<qe/> and they had rowed through the gloomy shadow of Windsor Castle and on past Eton.</s> </p>

<p pid="1415" id="dominics.c0.p1415" type="speech"><s>Here the river is broken by a string of islands, which in many parts make the stream narrow; and the river being full of boats and barges, our three adventurers found themselves called upon to exercise more than ordinary precautions in keeping their course.</s> <s>This responsibility became at last so irksome that Oliver said, <qs/>"I say, can't we get out of this rabble anyhow?</s> <s>Why shouldn't we take the other side of the islands?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1416" id="dominics.c0.p1416"><s>"I don't know.</s> <s>It would be a good deal quieter.</s> <s>I wonder none of the boats do it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1418" id="dominics.c0.p1418"><s>Stephen did as he was bid.</s> <s>The stream was pretty strong just there, and the two rowers had to pull pretty hard to get round without drifting on to the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="1419" id="dominics.c0.p1419"><s>Once out of the main stream, they were delighted to find the course clear.</s> <s>Indeed, they had the channel all to themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="1420" id="dominics.c0.p1420" type="speech"><s>"What a jolly pace the stream is going at!" said Stephen; <qs/>"why don't you drift, you fellows, instead of pulling like that?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1424" id="dominics.c0.p1424"><s>Thus occupied, and the other two sitting with their backs to the prow, the unnatural pace at which the boat flew along did not for a moment or two become apparent.</s> <s>Suddenly, however, Wraysford started up.</s> </p>

<p pid="1426" id="dominics.c0.p1426"><s>"What's the row?" said Oliver, proceeding leisurely to obey the order.</s> </p>

<p pid="1428" id="dominics.c0.p1428"><s>They had indeed got into the race leading to the weir, and every moment the stream, swelled by recent rains, rushed faster.</s> </p>

<p pid="1429" id="dominics.c0.p1429"><s>"Pull your right--hard!" cried Wraysford, backing water while Oliver flew to his oar.</s> </p>

<p pid="1430" id="dominics.c0.p1430"><s>There was just time, by a tremendous effort, to save themselves; but Oliver's oar was caught under one of the seats, and before he could extricate it the precious opportunity was lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="1431" id="dominics.c0.p1431"><s>No one said a word.</s> <s>Stephen, with pale face, pulled his rudder string; and Wraysford, with his one oar, tried desperately to arrest the headlong progress of the boat.</s> </p>

<p pid="1432" id="dominics.c0.p1432"><s>There was a shout from the bank, and a nearer and louder one from the lock.</s> <s>They became conscious of a great half-open gate on their right, and a rush of footsteps beside them.</s> <s>Then, in far shorter time than it takes to write it, the boat, side on to the weir, lurched and dashed for a moment in the troubled water, and the next instant turned over, and the three boys were struggling in the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="1433" id="dominics.c0.p1433"><s>In an ordinary current such an adventure would have been of little moment, for the boys could swim.</s> <s>But in a torrent like this it was an awful peril.</s> <s>The swift flood sweeps on and sucks under its prey with fearful force.</s> <s>To resist it is impossible--to escape being dashed against its stony bottom is almost as impossible.</s> </p>

<p pid="1434" id="dominics.c0.p1434"><s>Mercifully for Oliver, he did escape this latter peril, and, being cool always in the presence of danger, he offered no resistance to the stream, but struck out hard under the water for as long as his breath would permit.</s> </p>

<p pid="1435" id="dominics.c0.p1435"><s>When at last, exhausted and unable to swim farther, he rose to the surface, he was in calm deep water many yards below the weir.</s> <s>Help was at hand, or he could never have reached the bank.</s> <s>As it was, when at last friendly arms did drag him ashore, he was too exhausted even to utter his brother's name.</s> </p>

<p pid="1436" id="dominics.c0.p1436"><s>Where was Stephen? and where was Wraysford?</s> </p>

<p pid="1437" id="dominics.c0.p1437"><s>Wraysford had been more fortunate even than Oliver in his first capsize.</s> <s>He was swept over the weir, indeed, but into a side eddy which brought him up violently against a projecting branch, to which he clung wildly.</s> <s>Here he would have been safe, and even able to help himself to shore.</s> <s>But at the moment when he began to draw himself up from the water on to the branch, there was something--an arm cast wildly up--in the water beside him.</s> <s>In an instant Wraysford quitted his hold and plunged once more into the rapid.</s> <s>How, he knew not, but he just reached the hapless boy.</s> <s>It was too late to recover the friendly branch.</s> <s>All he could do was to cling to Stephen and trust to reaching calm water safely.</s> <s>Many a bruise the two received in that terrible passage, but the elder boy never once quitted his hold of the younger.</s> </p>

<p pid="1444" id="dominics.c0.p1444"><s>Oliver found that the Fifth, all but one or two, had quite forgotten their suspicions of his bravery which had spoiled the pleasure of his last term, and there seemed every prospect of his getting through this with less risk to his quick temper than before.</s> </p>

<p pid="1446" id="dominics.c0.p1446"><s>At Saint Dominic's, for reasons best known to the all-wise beings who presided over its management, the principal examinations and "removes" of the year took place not, as in most schools, at the end of the Midsummer term, but at the beginning of the Autumn term, about Michaelmas; consequently now, with the examinations looming in the distance, everybody who had anything to hope for from hard work settled down to study like mad.</s> <s>Cricket was over for the year, and football had not begun.</s> <s>Except boating there was not much doing out of doors, and for that reason the season was favourable for work.</s> <s>Studies, which used to be bear-gardens now suddenly assumed an appearance of respectability and quiet.</s> <s>Books took the place of boxing-gloves, and pens of fencing-sticks.</s> <s>The disorderly idlers who had been in the habit of invading at will the quarters of the industrious were now given to understand they must "kick-up their heels" elsewhere.</s> <s>_They_ might not want to grind, but others did.</s> </p>

<p pid="1447" id="dominics.c0.p1447" type="speech"><s>The idlers of the Fifth, to whom this warning was addressed on every hand, had nothing for it but to obey, and, feeling themselves greatly ill-used, to retire sadly, to some spot where <qs/>"they could kick-up a row to themselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1448" id="dominics.c0.p1448"><s>Casting about them for such a spot, it happened that Braddy and Ricketts one day lit almost by accident on an old empty study, which some years since had been a monitor's room, but was now empty and tenantless.</s> </p>

<p pid="1500" id="dominics.c0.p1500"><s>This was Saturday.</s> <s>On Monday the examination would be over, and in a week the competitors would know their fates!</s> </p>

<p pid="1501" id="dominics.c0.p1501"><s>Some of my readers may know the queer sensation one sometimes gets at the approach of a long-looked-for and hardly-worked-for examination.</s> <s>For a week or so you have quietly been counting up what you _do_ know.</s> <s>Now there breaks upon you an awful picture of what you do _not_ know, and with it the absolute conviction that what you do not know is exactly what you ought to know, and what you do know is no use at all.</s> <s>It is too late to do anything.</s> <s>You cannot get up in a day what it would take you a fortnight to go through.</s> <s>And it is not much good, now you are sure it is useless, to go over again what you have done.</s> <s>You begin to feel a sort of despair, which becomes, as the hours close in, positively reckless.</s> <s>What do you care if you do miss?</s> <s>What's the use of bothering any more about it?</s> <s>It cannot be helped; why make yourself miserable?</s> <s>Only, you would give worlds to have the thing all over.</s> <s>Such at least were the sensations which stirred in the breasts of Oliver Greenfield and Horace Wraysford as they sat somewhat dejectedly over their books in Oliver's study that Saturday afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="1502" id="dominics.c0.p1502" type="speech"><s>They had both worked hard since the holidays, generally together, neither concealing from the other what he had read or what he intended to read.</s> <s>Very bad rivals were these two, for though each was intent on winning the scholarship, each felt he would not break his heart if the other beat him, and that, as every one knows, is a most unheard-of piece of toleration.</s> <s>Now, however, each felt he had had enough of it.</s> <s>Oliver in particular was very despondent.</s> <s>He slammed up his books suddenly, and said, <qs/>"I give it up; it's not a bit of use going on!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1510" id="dominics.c0.p1510" type="speech"><s>"Why," pursued Oliver, evidently bent on a melancholy tack, <qs/>"I assure you, Wray, I've forgotten half even of what I did know.</s> <s>I was going over some of those brutal Roman History dates in bed last night, for instance, and I positively couldn't remember one.</s> <s>Then I tried the map of Greece, but I was still worse there; I couldn't remember where one single place was except Athens and Corinth, and I'm sure I used to be pretty well up in that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1511" id="dominics.c0.p1511"><s>"I expect you were half asleep at the time," suggested his friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="1512" id="dominics.c0.p1512"><s>"No, I wasn't; I couldn't sleep a wink.</s> <s>I say, Wray, _wouldn't_ it be jolly if we only knew now what the questions are going to be on Monday?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1519" id="dominics.c0.p1519"><s>Hue and cry was forthwith made for Stephen, but he was not to be found.</s> <s>He was out, Paul said; at the post, or somewhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="1520" id="dominics.c0.p1520"><s>"Oh, all right; you can come and cox us yourself, youngster," said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="1523" id="dominics.c0.p1523"><s>"And you two going out to row!</s> <s>I say, the Sixth will win it if you don't look-out!" said Paul, in a very concerned voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="1524" id="dominics.c0.p1524"><s>It was quite a revelation to the two boys to discover how great was the interest taken by outsiders in the coming event.</s> <s>Paul was in a great state of alarm, and was actually inclined to refuse to aid and abet what he imagined to be a wicked waste of precious opportunity, until, putting his head into Loman's study, he found that the Sixth Form fellow was also not at work.</s> </p>

<p pid="1525" id="dominics.c0.p1525"><s>When Oliver and Wraysford appeared in boating flannels in the playground they created as much sensation as if they had been ghosts.</s> </p>

<p pid="1530" id="dominics.c0.p1530"><s>"I know; but aren't you grinding for it?</s> <s>I say, don't let them beat you!</s> <s>Hadn't you better work instead of going out?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1531" id="dominics.c0.p1531"><s>Ricketts, by the way, had not done a stroke of work that he could possibly help all the term!</s> </p>

<p pid="1532" id="dominics.c0.p1532"><s>All the other Fifth Form fellows they encountered echoed more or less anxiously the same advice.</s> <s>But the two friends were obdurate.</s> <s>Threats, promises, entreaties, would not put them off their row up the river, and they went on their way, leaving behind them an unusual gloom on the spirits of their dearest friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="1533" id="dominics.c0.p1533"><s>The only person who seemed really glad to see them leaving their work was Bramble.</s> <s>He, with his friend Padger, and a few other irreconcilables, were just returning from a rat-catching expedition, and the sight of the Fifth Form heroes in boating costume filled them with joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1534" id="dominics.c0.p1534"><s>"Hullo--my eye--hurrah!" shouted Bramble, taking in the situation in a moment.</s> <s>"There they go!</s> <s>I hope they get drowned; don't you, Padger?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1537" id="dominics.c0.p1537"><s>At this juncture Master Paul gave chase, and for a few moments Bramble and his friends were too much engaged to speak; but at last, when the chase was over, and further reprisals were out of the question, the hero of the Tadpoles summoned up all his remaining powers to yell:</s> </p>

<p pid="1538" id="dominics.c0.p1538"><s>"Yah boo, Nightingale!</s> <s>Hope you get drowned!</s> <s>Yah!" after which he went his way.</s> </p>

<p pid="1539" id="dominics.c0.p1539"><s>The two friends paddled quietly up the river.</s> <s>They talked very little, but both felt relieved to be away from their books.</s> <s>As they went on their spirits rose, greatly to Paul's displeasure.</s> <s>That young gentleman, immoderately jealous for the glory of the Fifth, was content as long as the two rowers remained grave and serious; he could then make himself believe they were engaged in mental exercises favourable to Monday's examination.</s> <s>But as soon as they began to whistle, and chaff him and one another, and talk of their holiday adventures, Paul became displeased, for they could not possibly do this and be inwardly preparing for the examination at the same time.</s> </p>

<p pid="1540" id="dominics.c0.p1540"><s>However, he had to submit as best he could, and gave all his attention to steering them carefully, so that it should be no fault of his, at any rate, if they were prevented from showing up on the critical day.</s> </p>

<p pid="1545" id="dominics.c0.p1545"><s>"Pleasant!</s> <s>Old man, if you hadn't been there it would have been a good deal worse than unpleasant.</s> <s>Poor Stee!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1546" id="dominics.c0.p1546"><s>"Pull your left, Greenfield senior, or you'll be into the bank!" sung out Paul.</s> </p>

<p pid="1547" id="dominics.c0.p1547"><s>They paddled on again until Gusset Lock came in sight.</s> <s>There were very few boats about; the season was, in fact, at an end, and the river, which a month or two ago had generally swarmed with boats just at this part on Saturday afternoons, looked quite deserted.</s> </p>

<p pid="1558" id="dominics.c0.p1558"><s>Beside them stood Loman, flushed, excited, and laughing loudly.</s> <s>Poor Stephen, very unlike himself, appeared to be utterly cowed and terrified, and uttered shriek upon shriek as his persecutors dragged him along.</s> </p>

<p pid="1649" id="dominics.c0.p1649"><s>"It's no go," he said, in answer to his friend's inquiry.</s> </p>

<p pid="1650" id="dominics.c0.p1650"><s>"Oh, well, never mind," said Wraysford.</s> <s>"Even if you could have fought, I dare say it wouldn't have done much good, for he's such a sullen beggar there would have been no making it up afterwards.</s> <s>If I were you I wouldn't bother any more about it.</s> <s>I'll let all the fellows know he refused to fight you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1651" id="dominics.c0.p1651"><s>"What's the use of that?" said Oliver.</s> <s>"Why tell them anything about it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1652" id="dominics.c0.p1652"><s>But tell them or not tell them, the fellows knew already.</s> <s>It had oozed out very soon that a fight was coming off, and instantly the whole school was in excitement.</s> <s>For, however little some of them cared about the personal quarrel between Oliver and Loman, a fight between Fifth and Sixth was too great an event to be passed by unheeded.</s> </p>

<p pid="1662" id="dominics.c0.p1662"><s>This was a sad blow to the Fifth.</s> <s>They saw no comfort anywhere.</s> <s>They flocked to Oliver's study, but he was not there, and Wraysford's door was locked.</s> <s>The news, however, was confirmed by other reporters, and in great grief and profound melancholy the Fifth swallowed their tea, and wondered if any set of fellows were so unlucky as they.</s> </p>

<p pid="1663" id="dominics.c0.p1663"><s>But their rage was as nothing to that of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles.</s> </p>

<p pid="1664" id="dominics.c0.p1664"><s>These amiable young animals had of course sniffed the battle from afar very early in the evening, and, as usual, rushed into all sorts of extremes of enthusiasm on the subject.</s> <s>A fight!</s> <s>A fight between Fifth and Sixth!</s> <s>A fight between Greenfield senior and a monitor!</s> <s>Oh, it was too good to be true, a perfect luxury; something to be grateful for, and no mistake!</s> </p>

<p pid="1665" id="dominics.c0.p1665"><s>Of course a meeting was forthwith assembled to gloat over the auspicious event.</s> </p>

<p pid="1709" id="dominics.c0.p1709"><s>This information was sufficiently vague to determine Oliver not to attempt a wild-goose chase after the Doctor that night, so, bidding a hurried good-night to Simon, he took his way down the passage which led to Stephen's dormitory.</s> </p>

<p pid="1710" id="dominics.c0.p1710"><s>He had not, however, gone many steps when a boy met him.</s> <s>It was Loman.</s> <s>There was a momentary struggle in Oliver's breast.</s> <s>Here was the--very opportunity which an hour or two ago he had so eagerly desired.</s> <s>The whole picture of that afternoon's adventures came up before his mind, and he felt his blood tingle as his eyes caught sight of Stephen's persecutor.</s> <s>Should he pay off the score now?</s> </p>

<p pid="1711" id="dominics.c0.p1711"><s>Loman saw him, and changed colour.</s> <s>He evidently guessed what was passing through his enemy's mind, for a quick flush came to his face and an angry scowl to his brow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1712" id="dominics.c0.p1712"><s>Oliver for one moment slackened pace.</s> <s>Then suddenly there came upon him a vision of Stephen's appealing face as he interceded that afternoon for the boy who had done him such mischief, and that vision settled the thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="1718" id="dominics.c0.p1718" type="speech"><s>A brick, indeed!</s> <s>Oliver went off to his own bed that night more dispirited and dissatisfied with himself than he had ever felt before.</s> <s>And all through his dreams his brother's troubled face looked up at him, and the trembling voice repeated, again and again, <qs/>"You are a brick to me--a brick to me!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1729" id="dominics.c0.p1729"><s>"Very kind of you," said a voice close by.</s> </p>

<p pid="1730" id="dominics.c0.p1730"><s>It was Wraysford himself, who had come in for this very genuine compliment.</s> </p>

<p pid="1731" id="dominics.c0.p1731" type="speech"><s>"Hullo!</s> <s>I say, look here, Wraysford," said the beaming Stephen, <qs/>"I'm going to cut Loman and fag for you.</s> <s>Isn't it jolly?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1732" id="dominics.c0.p1732"><s>"Depends on whether I have you.</s> <s>I don't want any Guinea-pigs in my study, mind."</s> </p>

<p pid="1733" id="dominics.c0.p1733"><s>Stephen's face fell.</s> <s>For even such a privilege as fagging for Wraysford he could not afford to sever the sacred ties which held him to the fellowship of the Guinea-pigs.</s> <s>"I really wouldn't kick-up shines," said he, imploringly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1734" id="dominics.c0.p1734"><s>"You'd be a queer Guinea-pig if you didn't!" was the flattering answer.</s> <s>"And how many times a week would you go on strike, eh?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1735" id="dominics.c0.p1735" type="speech"><s>"Oh!" said Stephen, <qs/>"I'll never go on strike again; I don't like it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1736" id="dominics.c0.p1736" type="speech"><s>The two friends laughed at this ingenuous admission, and then Wraysford said, <qs/>"Well, I'll have you; but mind, I'm awfully particular, and knock my fags about tremendously, don't I, Noll?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1737" id="dominics.c0.p1737"><s>"I don't mind that," said the delighted Stephen.</s> <s>"Besides, you've not had a fag to knock about!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1738" id="dominics.c0.p1738"><s>At that moment, however, the bell for morning chapel cut short all further talk for the present.</s> <s>Stephen obeyed its summons for once in a subdued and thankful frame of mind.</s> <s>Too often had those weekly services been to him occasions of mere empty form, when with his head full of school worries or school fun he had scarcely heard, much less heeded, what was said.</s> </p>

<p pid="1739" id="dominics.c0.p1739"><s>To-day, however, it was different.</s> <s>Stephen was a sobered boy.</s> <s>He had passed through perils and temptations from which, if he had escaped, it had been through no merit of his own.</s> <s>Things might have been far different.</s> <s>His life had been saved, so had his peace of mind, and now even the consequences of old transgressions had been lightened for him.</s> <s>What had he done to deserve all this?</s> </p>

<p pid="1740" id="dominics.c0.p1740"><s>This was the question which the boy humbly asked himself as he entered the chapel that morning, and the Doctor's sermon fitted well with his altered frame of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1741" id="dominics.c0.p1741"><s>It was a sermon such as he had often heard before in that chapel; the words struck him now with a new force which almost startled him.</s> <s>"Forgetting those things which are behind--reaching forth unto those things which are before,"--this was the Doctor's text, and in the few simple words in which he urged his hearers to lay the past, with all its burdens, and disappointments, and shame, upon Him in whom alone forgiveness is to be found, Stephen drank in new courage and hope for the future, and in the thankfulness and penitence of his heart resolved to commit his way more honestly than ever to the best of all keeping, compared with which even a brother's love is powerless.</s> </p>

<p pid="1742" id="dominics.c0.p1742"><s>Before the morning was over Stephen duly went to the Doctor, who talked to him very seriously.</s> <s>I need not repeat the talk here.</s> <s>Stephen was very penitent, and had the good sense to say as little as possible; but when it was all over he thanked the Doctor gratefully, and promised he should never have to talk to him for bad conduct again.</s> </p>

<p pid="1743" id="dominics.c0.p1743" type="speech"><s>"You must thank your brother for my not dealing a great deal more severely with the case," said Dr Senior; <qs/>"and I am quite ready to believe it will not occur again.</s> <s>Now, good-bye."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1744" id="dominics.c0.p1744"><s>And off Stephen went, the happiest boy alive, determined more than ever to respect the Doctor's authority, and prove himself a model boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1745" id="dominics.c0.p1745"><s>Sunday afternoon at Saint Dominic's was usually spent by the boys in fine weather, in strolling about in the gardens, or rambling into the woods by the banks of the Shar.</s> </p>

<p pid="1746" id="dominics.c0.p1746"><s>This afternoon, however, was somewhat overcast, and a good many of the boys consequently preferred staying indoors to running the risk of spoiling their best hats in a shower.</s> <s>Among those who kept the house was Oliver, who, in reply to Wraysford's invitation to go out, pleaded that he was not in the humour.</s> </p>

<p pid="1747" id="dominics.c0.p1747"><s>This indeed was the case, for, now that Stephen's affairs were settled, the dread of the approaching Nightingale examination came back over him like a nightmare, and made him quite miserable.</s> <s>The nearer the hour of trial came the more convinced did Oliver become that he stood no chance whatever of winning, and with that conviction all the bright hopes of a university course, and the prospects of after-success, seemed extinguished.</s> </p>

<p pid="1748" id="dominics.c0.p1748"><s>Of course it was very ridiculous of him to worry himself into such a state, but then, reader, he had been working just a little too hard, and it was hardly his fault if he was ridiculous.</s> </p>

<p pid="1749" id="dominics.c0.p1749"><s>Wraysford, though by no means in high spirits, kept his head a good deal better, and tried to enjoy his walk and forget all about books, as if nothing at all was going to happen to-morrow.</s> <s>As for Loman, he was not visible from morning till night, and a good many guessed, and guessed correctly, that he was at work, even on Sunday.</s> </p>

<p pid="1750" id="dominics.c0.p1750"><s>The small boys, not so much though, I fear, out of reverence for the day as for partisanship of the Fifth, were very indignant on the subject, and held a small full-dress meeting after tea, to protest against one of the candidates taking such an unfair advantage over the others.</s> </p>

<p pid="1751" id="dominics.c0.p1751"><s>"He ought to be expelled!" exclaimed Paul.</s> </p>

<p pid="1752" id="dominics.c0.p1752"><s>"All very well," said Bramble.</s> <s>"Greenfield senior's cramming too, he's been in all the afternoon."</s> </p>

<p pid="1753" id="dominics.c0.p1753"><s>"He's not cramming, he's got a headache!" said Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="1754" id="dominics.c0.p1754"><s>"Oh, yes, I dare say, don't you, Padger?</s> <s>Got a headache--that's a nice excuse for copying out of cribs on a Sunday."</s> </p>

<p pid="1755" id="dominics.c0.p1755"><s>"He doesn't use cribs, and I tell you he's not working!" said Stephen, indignantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1756" id="dominics.c0.p1756"><s>"Shut up, do you hear, or you'll get turned out, Potboy!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1757" id="dominics.c0.p1757" type="speech"><s>This was too much for Stephen, who left the assembly in disgust, after threatening to take an early opportunity on the next day of giving his adversary <qs/>"one for himself,"<qe/> a threat which we may as well say at once here he did not fail to carry out with his wonted energy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1758" id="dominics.c0.p1758"><s>The long Sunday ended at last--a Sunday spoiled to many of the boys of Saint Dominic's by distracting thoughts and cares--a day which many impatiently wished over, and which some wished would never give place to the morrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1759" id="dominics.c0.p1759"><s>But that morrow came at last, and with it rose Oliver, strengthened and hopeful once more for the trial that lay before him.</s> <s>He was early at Wraysford's study, whom he found only just out of bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1760" id="dominics.c0.p1760"><s>"Look alive, old man.</s> <s>What do you say to a dip in the river before breakfast?</s> <s>We've got plenty of time, and it will wash off the cobwebs before the exam."</s> </p>

<p pid="1761" id="dominics.c0.p1761"><s>"All serene," said Wraysford, not very cheerily, though.</s> <s>"Anything's better than doing nothing."</s> </p>

<p pid="1762" id="dominics.c0.p1762"><s>"Why, Wray, I thought you weren't going to let yourself get down about it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1763" id="dominics.c0.p1763"><s>"I thought you weren't going to let yourself get up--why, you're quite festive this morning."</s> </p>

<p pid="1764" id="dominics.c0.p1764"><s>"Well, you see, a fellow can't do better than his best, and so as I have done my best I don't mean to punish myself by getting in the blues."</s> </p>

<p pid="1765" id="dominics.c0.p1765"><s>"Pity you didn't make that resolution yesterday.</s> <s>You were awfully glum, you know, then; and now I've got my turn, you see."</s> </p>

<p pid="1766" id="dominics.c0.p1766"><s>"Oh, never mind, a plunge in the Shar will set you all right."</s> </p>

<p pid="1767" id="dominics.c0.p1767" type="speech"><s>"Stee," said he, addressing his younger brother, who at that moment entered proudly in his new capacity as Wraysford's fag, <qs/>"mind you have breakfast ready sharp by eight, do you hear? the best you can get out of Wray's cupboard.</s> <s>Come along, old boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1768" id="dominics.c0.p1768"><s>And so they went down to the river, Oliver in unusually good spirits, and Wraysford most unusually depressed and nervous.</s> <s>The bathe was not a great success, for Wraysford evidently did not enjoy it.</s> </p>

<p pid="1769" id="dominics.c0.p1769" type="speech"><s>"What's wrong, old man?" said Oliver, as they walked back, <qs/>"aren't you well?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1770" id="dominics.c0.p1770"><s>"I'm all right," said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="1771" id="dominics.c0.p1771"><s>"But you're out of spirits.</s> <s>It's odd that I was in dumps and you were in good spirits up to the fatal day, and now things are just reversed.</s> <s>But, I say, you mustn't get down, you know, or it'll tell against you at the exam."</s> </p>

<p pid="1772" id="dominics.c0.p1772"><s>"It strikes me every answer I give will tell against me.</s> <s>All I hope is that you get the scholarship."</s> </p>

<p pid="1774" id="dominics.c0.p1774"><s>And so they went into breakfast, which was a solemn meal, and despite Stephen's care in hunting up delicacies, not very well partaken of.</s> </p>

<p pid="1775" id="dominics.c0.p1775"><s>It seemed ages before the nine o'clock bell summoned them down to the Fifth Form room.</s> </p>

<p pid="1776" id="dominics.c0.p1776"><s>Here, however, the sympathy and encouragement of their class-fellows amply served to pass the time till the examination began.</s> </p>

<p pid="1781" id="dominics.c0.p1781" type="speech"><s>"So you fellows," continued Tony, <qs/>"may command my services from morning to night if you like."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1789" id="dominics.c0.p1789"><s>The Doctor's entry, however, put an end to any further talk, and, as usual, a dead silence ensued after the boys had taken their seats.</s> </p>

<p pid="1790" id="dominics.c0.p1790"><s>The Doctor looked a little uneasy.</s> <s>Doubtless he was impressed, too, by the importance of the occasion.</s> <s>He proceeded to call over the lists of candidates for the different examinations in a fidgety manner, very unlike his usual self, and then turning abruptly to the class, said:</s> </p>

<p pid="1810" id="dominics.c0.p1810"><s>Reader, you doubtless know the horrors of an examination-room as well as I do.</s> <s>You know what it is to sit biting the end of your pen, and glaring at the ruthless question in front of you.</s> <s>You know what it is to dash nervously from question to question, answering a bit of this and a bit of that, but lacking the patience to work steadily down the list.</s> <s>And you have experienced doubtless the aggravation of hearing the pen of the man on your right flying along the paper with a hideous squeak, never stopping for a moment to give you a chance.</s> <s>And knowing all this, there is no need for me to describe the vicissitudes of this particular day of ordeal at Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="1811" id="dominics.c0.p1811"><s>The work went steadily on from morning to afternoon.</s> <s>More than one anxious face darted now and then nervous glances up at the clock, as the hour of closing approached.</s> </p>

<p pid="1812" id="dominics.c0.p1812" type="speech"><s>Loman was one of them.</s> <s>He was evidently in difficulties, and the Fifth Form fellows, who looked round occasionally from their English Literature papers, were elated to see their own men writing steadily and hard, while the Sixth man looked all aground.</s> <s>There was one boy, however, who had no time for such observations.</s> <s>That was Simon.</s> <s>He had got hold of a question which was after his own heart, and demanded every second of his attention--<qs/>"Describe, in not more than twelve lines of blank verse, the natural beauties of the River Shar."<qe/></s> <s>Here was a chance for the _Dominican_ poet!</s> </p>

<p pid="1813" id="dominics.c0.p1813"><s>"The Shar is a very beautiful stream, Of the Ouse a tributary; Up at Gusset Weir it's prettiest, I ween, Because there the birds sing so merry."</s> </p>

<p pid="1815" id="dominics.c0.p1815"><s>Among the last to finish up was Oliver, who had been working hammer and tongs during the whole examination.</s> </p>

<p pid="1842" id="dominics.c0.p1842"><s>Pembury vouchsafed no answer, but whistled to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="1843" id="dominics.c0.p1843" type="speech"><s>"All I can say is," said Bullinger, who was one of Wraysford's chums, <qs/>"it looks uncommonly ugly, if what Simon says is true."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1850" id="dominics.c0.p1850"><s>This candid admission on the part of the ingenious poet was too much for the gravity of one or two of the Fifth.</s> <s>Wraysford, however, was in no laughing mood, and went off to his study in great perturbation.</s> </p>

<p pid="1851" id="dominics.c0.p1851"><s>He could not for a moment believe that his friend could be guilty of such a dishonourable act as stealing an examination paper, and his impulse was to go at once to Oliver's study and get the suspicions of the Fifth laid there and then.</s> <s>But the fear of seeming in the least degree to join in those suspicions kept him back.</s> <s>He tried to laugh the thing to scorn inwardly, and called himself a villain and a traitor twenty times for admitting even the shadow of a doubt into his own mind.</s> <s>Yet, as Wraysford sat that afternoon and brooded over his friend's new trouble, he became more and more uncomfortable.</s> </p>

<p pid="1852" id="dominics.c0.p1852"><s>When on a former occasion the fellows had called in question Oliver's courage, he had felt so sure, so very sure the suspicion was a groundless one, that he had never taken it seriously to heart.</s> <s>But somehow this affair was quite different.</s> <s>What possible object would Simon, for instance, have for telling a deliberate lie? and if it had been a lie, why should Oliver have betrayed such confusion on hearing it?</s> </p>

<p pid="1853" id="dominics.c0.p1853"><s>These were questions which, try all he would, Wraysford could not get out of his mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1854" id="dominics.c0.p1854"><s>When Stephen presently came in, cheery as ever, and eager to hear how the examination had gone off, the elder boy felt an awkwardness in talking to him which he had never experienced before.</s> <s>As for Stephen, he put down the short, embarrassed answers he received to Wraysford's own uneasiness as to the result of the examination.</s> <s>Little guessed the boy what was passing in the other's mind!</s> </p>

<p pid="1855" id="dominics.c0.p1855"><s>There was just one hope Wraysford clung to.</s> <s>That was that Oliver should come out anywhere but first in the result.</s> <s>If Loman, or Wraysford himself, were to win, no one would be able to say his friend had profited by a dishonourable act; indeed, it would be as good as proof he had not taken the paper.</s> </p>

<p pid="1856" id="dominics.c0.p1856"><s>And yet Wraysford felt quite sick as he called to mind the unflagging manner in which Oliver had worked at his paper that morning, covering sheet upon sheet with his answers, and scarcely drawing in until time was up.</s> <s>It didn't look like losing, this.</s> </p>

<p pid="1857" id="dominics.c0.p1857" type="speech"><s>He threw himself back in his chair in sheer misery.</s> <s>"I would sooner have done the thing myself," groaned he to himself, <qs/>"than Oliver."<qe/></s> <s>Then suddenly he added, <qs/>"But it's not true!</s> <s>I'm certain of it!</s> <s>He couldn't do it!</s> <s>I'll never believe it of him!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1858" id="dominics.c0.p1858"><s>Poor Wraysford!</s> <s>It was easier to say the generous words than feel them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1861" id="dominics.c0.p1861"><s>"No, I don't," replied Wraysford, but so sadly and hesitatingly that had he at once confessed he did, he could not have expressed his meaning more plainly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1862" id="dominics.c0.p1862" type="speech"><s>"I'd give anything to be sure it was all false," said Pembury, <qs/>"and so would a lot of the fellows.</s> <s>As for that fool Simon--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1863" id="dominics.c0.p1863" type="speech"><s>"Bah!" exclaimed Wraysford, fiercely, <qs/>"the fellow ought to be kicked round the school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1864" id="dominics.c0.p1864"><s>"He's getting on that way already, I fancy," said Pembury.</s> <s>"I was saying I'd think nothing at all about it if what he says was the only thing to go by, but--well, you saw what a state Greenfield got into about it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1865" id="dominics.c0.p1865"><s>"Maybe he was just in a sudden rage with the fellow for thinking of such a thing," said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="1866" id="dominics.c0.p1866" type="speech"><s>"It looked like something more than rage," said Pembury, dismally, <qs/>"something a good deal more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1867" id="dominics.c0.p1867"><s>Wraysford said nothing, but fidgeted in his chair.</s> <s>A long silence followed, each busy with his own thoughts and both yearning for any sign of hope.</s> <s>"I don't see what good it could have done him if he did take the paper.</s> <s>He'd have no time to cram it up yesterday.</s> <s>He was out with you, wasn't he, all the afternoon?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1868" id="dominics.c0.p1868" type="speech"><s>"No," said Wraysford, not looking up, <qs/>"he had a headache and stayed in."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1874" id="dominics.c0.p1874"><s>Simon was made to repeat his story once more, and stuck to it too, in spite of all the browbeating he got.</s> </p>

<p pid="1876" id="dominics.c0.p1876"><s>"Oh, because, you know, I wanted to get off a letter by the post, and thought I was in time till I saw the clock opposite the Doctor's study said five minutes past."</s> </p>

<p pid="1877" id="dominics.c0.p1877"><s>"Did Greenfield say anything to you when he saw you?" some one else asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="1882" id="dominics.c0.p1882" type="speech"><s>"Oh, no, you know, he went off the other way as quick as he could," said Simon, in a voice as though he would say, <qs/>"How can you ask such an absurd question?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1889" id="dominics.c0.p1889"><s>The thing was beyond a doubt; and as the Fifth sat there in judgment, a sense of shame and humiliation came over them, to which many of them were unused.</s> </p>

<p pid="1896" id="dominics.c0.p1896"><s>There was nothing more than this to be said, assuredly, to prove the disgust of the Fifth at the conduct of their class-fellow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1900" id="dominics.c0.p1900"><s>For it must be said of the Dominicans--and I think it may be said of a good many English public schoolboys besides--that, however foolish they may have been in other respects, however riotous, however jealous of one another, however well satisfied with themselves, a point of honour was a point which they all took seriously to heart.</s> <s>They could forgive a schoolfellow for doing a disobedient act sometimes, or perhaps even a vicious act, but a cowardly or dishonourable action was a thing which nothing would excuse, and which they felt not only a disgrace to the boy perpetrating it, but a disgrace put upon themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="1901" id="dominics.c0.p1901"><s>Had Oliver been the most popular boy in the school it would have been all the same.</s> <s>As it was, he was a long way from being the most popular.</s> <s>He never took any pains to win the good opinion of his fellows.</s> <s>When, by means of some achievement in which he excelled, he had contrived (as in the case of the cricket match last term) to bring glory on his school and to make himself a hero in the eyes of Saint Dominic's, he had been wont to take the applause bestowed on him with the utmost indifference, which some might even construe into contempt.</s> <s>And in precisely the same spirit would he take the displeasure which he now and then managed to incur.</s> </p>

<p pid="1902" id="dominics.c0.p1902"><s>Boys don't like this.</s> <s>It irritates them to see their praise or blame made little of; and for this reason, if for no other, Oliver would hardly have been a favourite.</s> </p>

<p pid="1903" id="dominics.c0.p1903"><s>But there was another reason.</s> <s>Now that the Fifth found their faith in Greenfield senior rudely dashed to the ground, they were not slow to recall the unpleasant incidents of last term, when, by refusing to thrash Loman, he had discredited the whole Form, and laid himself under the suspicion of cowardice.</s> </p>

<p pid="1904" id="dominics.c0.p1904"><s>Most of the fellows had at the time of the Nightingale examination either forgotten, or forgiven, or repented of their suspicions, and, indeed, by his challenge to Loman the previous Saturday Oliver had been considered quite to have redeemed his reputation in this respect.</s> <s>But now it all came up again.</s> <s>A fellow who could do a cowardly deed at one time could do a mean one at another.</s> <s>If one was natural to his character, so was the other, and in fact one explained the other.</s> <s>He was mean when he showed himself a coward last term.</s> <s>He was a coward when he did a mean act this term.</s> </p>

<p pid="1905" id="dominics.c0.p1905"><s>What wonder, in these circumstances, if the Fifth felt sore, very sore indeed, on the subject of Oliver Greenfield?</s> </p>

<p pid="1906" id="dominics.c0.p1906"><s>To every one's relief, he did not put in an appearance again that day.</s> <s>He kept his study, and Paul brought down word at prayer time that he had a headache and had gone to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1907" id="dominics.c0.p1907"><s>At this the Fifth smiled grimly and said nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="1908" id="dominics.c0.p1908"><s>Next morning, however, Oliver turned up as usual in his place.</s> <s>He looked pale, but otherwise unconcerned, and those who looked-for traces of shame and self-abasement in his face were sorely disappointed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1909" id="dominics.c0.p1909"><s>He surely must have known or guessed the resolution the Fifth had come to with regard to him; but from his unabashed manner he was evidently determined not to take it for granted till the hint should be given pretty clearly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1910" id="dominics.c0.p1910"><s>On Ricketts, whose desk was next to that of Oliver, fell the task of first giving this hint.</s> </p>

<p pid="1912" id="dominics.c0.p1912"><s>Ricketts' only answer was to turn his back and begin to talk to his other neighbour.</s> </p>

<p pid="1913" id="dominics.c0.p1913"><s>Those who were watching this incident noticed a sudden flush on Oliver's cheek as he stared for an instant at his late friend.</s> <s>Then with an effort he seemed to recover himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="1915" id="dominics.c0.p1915"><s>But he now and then looked furtively up in the direction of Wraysford, who was seated at an opposite desk.</s> <s>The eyes of the two friends met now and then, and when they did each seemed greatly embarrassed.</s> <s>For Wraysford, after a night's heart-searching, had come to the determination not, after all, to cut his friend; and yet he found it impossible to feel and behave towards him as formerly.</s> <s>He tried very hard indeed not to appear constrained, but the more he tried the more embarrassed he felt.</s> <s>After class he purposely walked across the room to meet his old chum.</s> </p>

<p pid="1916" id="dominics.c0.p1916"><s>"How are you?" he said, in a forced tone and manner utterly unlike his old self.</s> </p>

<p pid="1923" id="dominics.c0.p1923"><s>The adventures of the morning did not certainly tend to make the Fifth think better of Oliver Greenfield.</s> </p>

<p pid="1924" id="dominics.c0.p1924"><s>Had he appeared before them humble and penitent, there were some who even then might have tried to forgive him and forget what was done.</s> <s>But instead of that he was evidently determined to brazen the thing out, and had begun by snubbing the very fellows whom he had so deeply injured.</s> </p>

<p pid="1925" id="dominics.c0.p1925"><s>Wraysford felt specially hurt.</s> <s>It had cost him a good deal to put on a friendly air and speak as if nothing had happened; and to find himself scorned for his pains and actually avoided by the friend who had wronged him was too much.</s> <s>But even that would not have been so bad, had not Oliver immediately gone and made up to Simon before all the class.</s> </p>

<p pid="1926" id="dominics.c0.p1926"><s>Wraysford did not remain to join in the chorus of indignation in which the others indulged after morning school was over.</s> <s>He left them and strolled out dismally into the playground.</s> </p>

<p pid="1927" id="dominics.c0.p1927"><s>He must do something!</s> <s>He must know one way or the other what to think of Oliver.</s> <s>Even now he would gladly believe that it was all a dream, and that nothing had come between him and his old friend.</s> <s>But the more he pondered it the more convinced he became it was anything but a dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="1928" id="dominics.c0.p1928"><s>He wandered unconsciously beyond the playground towards the woods on the side of the Shar, where he and Oliver had walked so often in the old days.</s> </p>

<p pid="1929" id="dominics.c0.p1929"><s>The old days!</s> <s>It was but yesterday that they had last walked there.</s> <s>Yet what an age ago it seemed! and how impossible that the old days should ever come back again.</s> </p>

<p pid="1930" id="dominics.c0.p1930"><s>He had not got far into the wood when he heard what seemed to him familiar footsteps ahead of him.</s> <s>Yesterday he would have shouted and whistled and called on the fellow to hold hard.</s> <s>But now he had no such inclination.</s> <s>His impulse was to turn round and go back.</s> </p>

<p pid="1931" id="dominics.c0.p1931" type="speech"><s>"And yet," thought he, <qs/>"why should _I go_ back?</s> <s>If it is Oliver, what have _I_ to feel ashamed of?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1932" id="dominics.c0.p1932"><s>And so he advanced.</s> <s>The boy in front of him was walking slowly, and Wraysford soon came in view of him.</s> <s>As he expected, it was Oliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="1933" id="dominics.c0.p1933"><s>At the sight of his old friend, wandering here solitary and listless, all Wraysford's old affection came suddenly back.</s> <s>At least he would make one more effort.</s> <s>So he quickened his pace.</s> <s>Oliver turned and saw him coming.</s> <s>But he did not wait.</s> <s>He walked on slowly as before, apparently indifferent to the approach of anybody.</s> </p>

<p pid="1934" id="dominics.c0.p1934"><s>This was a damper certainly to Wraysford.</s> <s>At least Oliver might have guessed why his friend was coming after him.</s> </p>

<p pid="1935" id="dominics.c0.p1935"><s>It was desperately hard to know how to begin a conversation.</s> <s>Oliver trudged on, sullen and silent, in anything but an encouraging manner.</s> <s>Still, Wraysford, now his mind was made up, was not to be put from his purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="1936" id="dominics.c0.p1936"><s>"Noll, old man," he began, in as much of his old tone and manner as he could assume.</s> </p>

<p pid="1937" id="dominics.c0.p1937"><s>"Well?" said Oliver, not looking up.</s> </p>

<p pid="1939" id="dominics.c0.p1939" type="speech"><s>The question cost the speaker a hard effort, and evidently went home.</s> <s>Oliver stopped short in his walk, and looking full in his old friend's face, said, <qs/>"Why do you ask?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1940" id="dominics.c0.p1940"><s>"Because I'm afraid we are not friends at this moment."</s> </p>

<p pid="1941" id="dominics.c0.p1941"><s>"And whose fault is that?" said Oliver, scornfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="1942" id="dominics.c0.p1942"><s>The question stung Wraysford as much as it amazed him.</s> <s>Was he, then, of all the fellows in the school, to have an explanation thus demanded of him from one who had done him the most grievous personal wrong one schoolboy well could do to another?</s> </p>

<p pid="1943" id="dominics.c0.p1943" type="speech"><s>His face flushed as he replied slowly, <qs/>"Your fault, Greenfield; how can you ask?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1944" id="dominics.c0.p1944"><s>Oliver gave a short laugh very like contempt, and then turned suddenly on his heel, leaving Wraysford smarting with indignation, and finally convinced that between his old friend and himself there was a gulf which now it would be hard indeed to bridge over.</s> </p>

<p pid="1946" id="dominics.c0.p1946" type="speech"><s>"Hullo, Wray," he shouted, as the elder boy entered; <qs/>"don't you wish it was this time to-morrow?</s> <s>I do, I'm mad to hear the result!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1950" id="dominics.c0.p1950"><s>There was something unusual in his tone which surprised the small boy.</s> <s>He put it down, however, to worry about the examination, and quietly withdrew as commanded.</s> </p>

<p pid="1951" id="dominics.c0.p1951"><s>The next day came at last.</s> <s>Two days ago, in the Fifth Form, at any rate, it would have been uphill work for any master to attempt to conduct morning class in the face of all the eagerness and enthusiasm with which the result of the examinations would have been looked-for.</s> <s>Now, however, there was all the suspense, indeed, but it was the suspense of dread rather than triumph.</s> </p>

<p pid="1952" id="dominics.c0.p1952"><s>"Never mind," said Ricketts to Pembury, after the two had been talking over the affair for the twentieth time.</s> <s>"Never mind; and there's just this, Tony, if Wray is only second, it will be a splendid win for the Fifth all the same."</s> </p>

<p pid="1953" id="dominics.c0.p1953"><s>"I see nothing splendid in the whole concern," said Pembury.</s> <s>And that was the general feeling.</s> </p>

<p pid="1956" id="dominics.c0.p1956"><s>At last he entered, and a hush fell over the class.</s> <s>One or two glanced quickly up, as though they hoped to read their fate in the head master's face.</s> <s>Others waited, too anxious to stir or look up.</s> <s>Others groaned inwardly with a sort of prophetic foresight of what was to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="1958" id="dominics.c0.p1958"><s>Wraysford looked furtively across the room to where his old friend sat.</s> <s>There was a flush in Oliver's face as he followed the Doctor with his eyes; he was breathing hard, Wraysford could see, and the corners of his mouth were working with more than ordinary nervousness.</s> </p>

<p pid="1959" id="dominics.c0.p1959" type="speech"><s>"Alas!" thought Wraysford, <qs/>"I don't envy him his thoughts!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1963" id="dominics.c0.p1963" type="speech"><s>"I say," whispered he to Oliver, who sat in front of him, <qs/>"I know it's a mistake: you know I wrote five cantos about the Shar--good too.</s> <s>He's lost that.</s> <s>I say, had I better tell him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1964" id="dominics.c0.p1964" type="speech"><s>Oliver vouchsafing no reply, the unfortunate poet merely replied to the head master's remarks, <qs/>"Yes, sir,"<qe/> and then subsided, more convinced than ever that Saint Dominic's was not worthy of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="1968" id="dominics.c0.p1968" type="speech"><s>Ah, now!</s> <s>There was a quick stir, and then a deeper silence than ever as the Doctor slowly read out, <qs/>"The maximum number of marks possible, 120.</s> <s>First, Greenfield, Fifth Form, 112 marks.</s> <s>And I must say I and the examiners are astonished as well as highly gratified with this really brilliant performance.</s> <s>Greenfield, I congratulate you as well as your class-fellows on your success.</s> <s>It does you the very greatest credit!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1969" id="dominics.c0.p1969"><s>A dead silence followed this eulogium.</s> <s>Those who watched Oliver saw his face first glow, then turn pale, as the Doctor spoke.</s> <s>He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the paper in the head master's hand, as if waiting for what was to follow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1970" id="dominics.c0.p1970" type="speech"><s>The Doctor went on, <qs/>"Second, Wraysford, Fifth Form, 97 marks, also a creditable performance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1971" id="dominics.c0.p1971"><s>One or two near Wraysford clapped him warmly on the back, and throughout the class generally there was a show of satisfaction at this result, in strange contrast with the manner in which the announcement of Oliver's success had been received.</s> </p>

<p pid="2117" id="dominics.c0.p2117"><s>Were you ever at Coventry, reader?</s> <s>I don't mean the quaint old Warwickshire city, but that other place where from morning till night you are shunned and avoided by everybody?</s> <s>Where friends with whom you were once on the most intimate terms now pass you without a word, or look another way as you go by?</s> <s>Where, whichever way you go, you find yourself alone?</s> <s>Where every one you speak to is deaf, every one you appear before is blind, every one you go near has business somewhere else?</s> <s>Where you will be left undisturbed in your study for a week, to fag for yourself, study by yourself, disport yourself with yourself?</s> <s>Where in the playground you will be as solitary as if you were in the desert, in school you will be a class by yourself, and even in church on Sundays you will feel hopelessly out in the cold among your fellow-worshippers?</s> </p>

<p pid="2118" id="dominics.c0.p2118"><s>If you have ever been to such a place, you can imagine Oliver Greenfield's experiences during this Christmas term at Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2119" id="dominics.c0.p2119" type="speech"><s>When the gentlemen of the Fifth Form had once made up their minds to anything, they generally carried it through with great heartiness, and certainly they never succeeded better in any undertaking than in this of <qs/>"leaving Oliver to himself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2120" id="dominics.c0.p2120"><s>The only drawback to their success was that the proceeding appeared to have little or no effect on the _very_ person on whose behalf it was undertaken.</s> <s>Not that Oliver could be _quite_ insensible of the honours paid him.</s> <s>He could not--they were too marked for that.</s> <s>And without doubt they were as unpleasant as they were unmistakable.</s> <s>But, for any sign of unhappiness he displayed, the whole affair might have been a matter of supreme indifference to him.</s> <s>Indeed, it looked quite as much as if Greenfield had sent the Fifth to Coventry as the Fifth Greenfield.</s> <s>If they determined none of them to speak to him, he was equally determined none of them should have the chance; and if it was part of their scheme to leave him as much as possible to himself, they had little trouble in doing it, for he, except when inevitable, never came near them.</s> </p>

<p pid="2121" id="dominics.c0.p2121"><s>Of course this was dreadfully irritating to the Fifth!</s> <s>The moral revenge they had promised themselves on the disgracer of their class never seemed to come off.</s> <s>The wind was taken out of their sails at every turn.</s> <s>The object of their aversion was certainly not reduced to humility or penitence by their conduct; on the contrary, one or two of them felt decidedly inclined to be ashamed of themselves and feel foolish when they met their victim.</s> </p>

<p pid="2122" id="dominics.c0.p2122"><s>Oliver always had been a queer fellow, and he now came out in a queerer light than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="2123" id="dominics.c0.p2123"><s>Having once seen how the wind lay, and what he had to expect from the Fifth, he altered the course of his life to suit the new circumstances with the greatest coolness.</s> <s>Instead of going up the river in a pair-oar or a four, he now went up in a sculling boat or a canoe, and seemed to enjoy himself quite as much.</s> <s>Instead of doing his work with Wraysford evening after evening, he now did it undisturbed by himself, and, to judge by his progress in class, more successfully than ever.</s> <s>Instead of practising with the fifteens at football, he went in for a regular course of practice in the gymnasium, and devoted himself with remarkable success to the horizontal bar and the high jump.</s> <s>Instead of casting in his lot in class with a jovial though somewhat distracting set, he now kept his mind free for his studies, and earned the frequent commendation of the Doctor and Mr Jellicott.</s> </p>

<p pid="2124" id="dominics.c0.p2124"><s>Now, reader, I ask you, if you had been one of the Fifth of Saint Dominic's would not all this have been very riling?</s> <s>Here was a fellow convicted of a shameful piece of deceit, caught, one might say, in the very act, and by his own conduct as good as admitting it.</s> <s>Here was a fellow, I say, whom every sensible boy ought to avoid, not only showing himself utterly indifferent to the aversion of his class-fellows, but positively thriving and triumphing before their very faces!</s> <s>Was it any wonder if they felt very sore, and increasingly sore on the subject of Oliver Greenfield?</s> </p>

<p pid="2125" id="dominics.c0.p2125"><s>One boy, of course, stuck to the exile through thick and thin.</s> <s>If Oliver had murdered all Saint Dominic's with slow poison, Stephen would have stuck to him to the end, and he stuck to him now.</s> <s>He, at least, never once admitted that his brother was guilty.</s> <s>When slowly he first discovered what were the suspicions of the Fifth, and what was the common talk of the school about Oliver, the small boy's indignation was past description.</s> <s>He rushed to his brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="2143" id="dominics.c0.p2143"><s>And the poor boy, wild with rage and misery, actually flung himself blindly upon his brother's old friend--the saviour of his own life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2144" id="dominics.c0.p2144"><s>Wraysford was not angry.</s> <s>There was more of pity in his face than anger as he took the small boy by the arm and led him to the door.</s> <s>Stephen no longer resisted.</s> <s>After giving vent to the first flood of his anger, misery got the upper hand of him, and he longed to go anywhere to hide it.</s> <s>He could have endured to know that Oliver was suspected by a good many of the fellows, but to find Wraysford among them was a cruel blow.</s> </p>

<p pid="2145" id="dominics.c0.p2145"><s>But in due time his indignation again came to the fore, and he ventured on another crusade.</s> <s>This time it was to Pembury.</s> <s>He knew before he went he had little enough to expect from the sharp-tongued editor of the _Dominican_, so he went hoping little.</s> </p>

<p pid="2146" id="dominics.c0.p2146"><s>To his surprise, however, Pembury was kinder than usual.</s> <s>He told him plainly that he did suspect Oliver, and explained why, and advised Stephen, if he were wise, to say as little about Oliver as possible at present.</s> <s>The young champion was quite cowed by this unexpected reception.</s> <s>He did his best to fly in a rage and be defiant, but it was no use, and he retired woefully discomfited from the interview.</s> </p>

<p pid="2147" id="dominics.c0.p2147"><s>Others to whom he applied, when once again his anger got the better of his wretchedness, met him with taunts, others with contempt, others with positive unkindness; and after a week Stephen gave it up and retired in dudgeon to the territory of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, determined that there at least he would, at the edge of the knuckle, if needs be, compel a faction to declare for his brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="2148" id="dominics.c0.p2148"><s>In this undertaking, I need hardly say, he was eminently successful.</s> <s>There were those among the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles who were ready to declare for anybody or anything as long as there was a chance of a row on the head of it.</s> <s>Already the question of Greenfield senior had been occupying their magnificent minds.</s> <s>When the story first fell suddenly into their midst, it was so surprising that, like the frogs and the log in the fable, they were inclined to be a little shy of it.</s> <s>But, gradually becoming accustomed to it, and looking carefully into it from all sides, it seemed somehow to contain the promise of a jolly row, and their hearts warmed to it proportionally.</s> <s>No one quite liked to start the thing at first, for fear doubtless of not doing it full justice, but it only wanted a spark to kindle the whole lower school on the question of Greenfield senior.</s> <s>Stephen it was who supplied the spark.</s> </p>

<p pid="2149" id="dominics.c0.p2149"><s>He entered the Fourth Junior room one day, after one of the unsuccessful crusades of which we have spoken, utterly cast down and out of humour.</s> <s>He flung his cap on to the peg, and himself on to his seat, in an unusually agitated manner, and then, to the astonishment of everybody, broke out into tears!</s> </p>

<p pid="2150" id="dominics.c0.p2150"><s>This was a rare and glorious opportunity, of course, for Bramble.</s> </p>

<p pid="2158" id="dominics.c0.p2158"><s>This declaration of war was promptly taken up on all sides, and for a short period the Fourth Junior had a rather dusty appearance.</s> <s>When at length a little order was restored, a lively discussion on the crime of Greenfield senior ensued.</s> <s>The Tadpoles to a man believed in it, and gave it as their candid opinion that the fellow ought to be hung.</s> <s>"Yes, and expelled too!" added a few of the more truculent.</s> </p>

<p pid="2159" id="dominics.c0.p2159"><s>The Guinea-pigs, on the other hand, whatever they thought, protested vehemently that Greenfield senior was the most virtuous, heroic, saintly, and jolly fellow in all Saint Dominic's, and denounced the Tadpoles and all the rest of the school as the most brutal ruffians in Christendom.</s> </p>

<p pid="2160" id="dominics.c0.p2160" type="speech"><s>"They ought all to be expelled, every one of them," said one; <qs/>"all except Greenfield senior, and I hope they will be."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2174" id="dominics.c0.p2174"><s>So they proceeded straightway to empty his cupboards and drawers, to polish up his cups, to unfold his clothes and fold them again, to take down his books and put them up again, to upset his ink and mop it up with one of his handkerchiefs, to make his tea and spill it on the floor, to dirty his collars with their inky hands, to clean his boots with his hat-brush, and many other thoughtful and friendly acts calculated to make the heart of their hero glad.</s> </p>

<p pid="2175" id="dominics.c0.p2175"><s>In the midst of their orgies, Wraysford and Pembury passed the door, and stopped to look in, wondering what on earth the tumult was about.</s> <s>But they were greeted with such a storm of yells and hisses that they passed on, a little uneasy in their minds as to whether or no hydrophobia had broken out in Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2176" id="dominics.c0.p2176"><s>After them a detachment of Tadpoles, headed by Bramble appeared on the scene, for the purpose of mocking.</s> <s>But, whatever their purpose may have been, it was abandoned for more active opposition when Paul presently emptied a tumblerful of lukewarm tea in the face of Master Bramble.</s> </p>

<p pid="2177" id="dominics.c0.p2177"><s>A notable battle was fought on the threshold of Greenfield senior's study, in which many were wounded on both sides, and in the midst of which Oliver arrived on the scene, kicking right and left, and causing a general rout.</s> </p>

<p pid="2178" id="dominics.c0.p2178"><s>How their hero appreciated the attentions his admirers had paid him during his absence the Guinea-pigs did not remain or return to ascertain.</s> <s>They took for granted he was grateful, and bashfully kept out of the way of his thanks for a whole day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2179" id="dominics.c0.p2179"><s>After that their enthusiasm returned, but this time it found a new vent.</s> <s>They decided that, although they would all fag for him to the end of his days, they would not for a season, at any rate, solicit jobs from him, but rather encourage him by their sympathy and applause at a more respectful distance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2180" id="dominics.c0.p2180"><s>So they took to cheering him in the playground, and following him down the passages.</s> <s>And this not being enough, they further relieved themselves by hooting (at a respectful distance also) the chiefs of the senior school, whose opinions on the question of Greenfield senior were known not to agree with their own.</s> </p>

<p pid="2181" id="dominics.c0.p2181"><s>If Oliver was not grateful for all this moral support in his trouble, he must have been a villain indeed of the deepest dye.</s> <s>He never said in so many words he was grateful; but then the Guinea-pigs remembered that feelings are often too deep and too many for words, and so took for granted the thanks which their consciences told them they deserved.</s> </p>

<p pid="2182" id="dominics.c0.p2182"><s>Meanwhile a fresh number of the _Dominican_ was in progress, and rapidly nearing the hour of publication.</s> </p>

<p pid="2184" id="dominics.c0.p2184"><s>The examination at the beginning of the term had seriously interfered with the prospects of the _Dominican_.</s> <s>Pembury knew well enough it was no good trying to get anything out of the diligent section of his class-fellows at such a time; and he knew equally well that a number contributed entirely by the idlers of the Fifth would neither be creditable to the paper nor appreciated by any one outside.</s> </p>

<p pid="2185" id="dominics.c0.p2185"><s>So like a prudent man he held back patiently till the examinations were over, and then pounced down on his men with redoubled importunity.</s> </p>

<p pid="2186" id="dominics.c0.p2186" type="speech"><s>"Look here," said he one day to Ricketts, <qs/>"when are you going to let me have that paper of yours?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2191" id="dominics.c0.p2191"><s>"Who says I will?" demanded Ricketts, inclined to be angry.</s> </p>

<p pid="2192" id="dominics.c0.p2192"><s>"It sounds as if _I_ do," replied the editor.</s> <s>"Why of course you'll do something for it, Rick?"</s> </p>

<p pid="2193" id="dominics.c0.p2193"><s>"I'd be glad enough, but really I'm not in the humour," said Ricketts.</s> </p>

<p pid="2194" id="dominics.c0.p2194"><s>"Why ever not?" demanded Tony.</s> </p>

<p pid="2195" id="dominics.c0.p2195" type="speech"><s>"Why, the fact is," said Ricketts, <qs/>"I fancy the Fifth is not exactly looking up at present, and we've nothing particular to be proud of.</s> <s>If you take my advice you'll keep the _Dominican_ quiet for a bit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2196" id="dominics.c0.p2196" type="speech"><s>"My dear fellow, that's the very thing we mustn't do.</s> <s>Don't you see, you old duffer you, that if we shut up shop and retire into private life, everybody will be thinking we daren't hold up our heads?</s> <s>I mean to hold up my head, for one," added Tony, proudly, <qs/>"if there were a thousand Greenfields in the class; and I mean to make you hold up yours too, old man.</s> <s>It'll be time enough to do the hang-dog business when we all turn knaves; but till we do, we've as good a right to be known at Saint Dominic's as anybody else.</s> <s>So none of your humbug, Rick.</s> <s>We'll get out an extra good _Dominican_, and let the fellows see we're alive and kicking."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2197" id="dominics.c0.p2197"><s>This speech had the required effect.</s> <s>It not only won over Ricketts, but most of the other leading spirits of the Fifth, who had been similarly holding back.</s> </p>

<p pid="2198" id="dominics.c0.p2198"><s>Tony was not the fellow to let an advantage go by.</s> <s>Having once got his men into a becoming frame of mind, he kept them well in hand and worked them up into something like the old enthusiasm on the subject of the _Dominican_.</s> </p>

<p pid="2199" id="dominics.c0.p2199"><s>Every one was determined the present number should be an out-and-out good one, and laboured and racked his brains accordingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2200" id="dominics.c0.p2200"><s>But somehow or other the fellows had never found it so hard, first to get inspirations, and then to put them down on paper, as they did at present.</s> <s>Every one thought he had something very fine and very clever to say if he could only find expression for it.</s> <s>The amount of brain-cudgelling that went on over this _Dominican_ was simply awful.</s> <s>Wraysford gave it up in disgust.</s> <s>Ricketts, Bullinger, Tom Senior, and others stumbled through their tasks, and could only turn out lame productions at the best.</s> <s>Even Pembury's lucubrations lacked a good deal of their wonted dash and spirit.</s> <s>The cloud which was hanging over the Fifth seemed to have overshadowed its genius for a while.</s> </p>

<p pid="2201" id="dominics.c0.p2201" type="speech"><s>Still Pembury kept his men at it and gave them no peace till their productions, such as they were, were safe in his hands.</s> <s>One boy only was equal to the emergency; that I need hardly say was Simon.</s> <s>He was indeed more eloquent than ever.</s> <s>He offered Pembury a poem of forty verses, entitled, <qs/>"An Elegy on the Wick of a Candle that had just been blown out,"<qe/><sls/> to begin with, and volunteered to supplement this contribution with one or two smaller pieces, such as, <sle/><qs/>"My Little Lark,"<qe/><sss/> or <sse/><qs/>"An Adventure outside the Dormitory Door,"<qe/><sss/> or <sse/><qs/>"Mind Mewsings."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2202" id="dominics.c0.p2202" type="speech"><s>Pembury prudently accepted all, and said he would insert what he thought fit, an assurance which delighted Simon, who immediately sat down and wrote some more <qs/>"pieces,"<qe/> in case at the last moment there might be room for them too.</s> <s>But, in spite even of these valuable contributions, the _Dominican_ fell flat.</s> <s>There were a few good things in it here and there, but it was far below its ordinary form; and not a few of the writers repented sorely that ever they had put pen to paper to help produce it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2203" id="dominics.c0.p2203" type="speech"><s>The chief amusement of the paper was contained in a <qs/>"New Code of Regulations for the Better Management of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles,"<qe/> from the editor's pen.</s> <s>It began thus:</s> </p>

<p pid="2231" id="dominics.c0.p2231"><s>Miserable stuff indeed, as Stephen thought, but quite stinging enough to wound him over and over again as he saw the sneers and heard the laughs with which the reading of the extract was greeted.</s> <s>Everybody evidently was against his brother, and, with a deep disgust and fury at his heart, he left them to laugh by themselves and returned to Oliver's study.</s> </p>

<p pid="2232" id="dominics.c0.p2232"><s>He found his brother in what were now his usual cheerful spirits.</s> <s>For after the first week or so of his being sent to Coventry, Oliver, in his own study at least, kept up a cheerful appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2233" id="dominics.c0.p2233"><s>"Hullo, Stee," said he as the young brother entered.</s> <s>"You're just in time.</s> <s>Here's a letter from mother."</s> </p>

<p pid="2235" id="dominics.c0.p2235"><s>So Oliver read it out.</s> <s>It was an ordinary, kind, motherly epistle, such as thousands of schoolboys get every week of the school year.</s> <s>All about home, and what is going on, how the dogs are, where sister Mary has been to, how the boiler burst last week, which apple-tree bore most, and so on; every scrap of news that could be scraped up from the four winds of heaven was in that letter.</s> </p>

<p pid="2236" id="dominics.c0.p2236"><s>And to the two brothers, far away, and lonely even among their schoolfellows, it came like a breath of fresh air that morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="2238" id="dominics.c0.p2238"><s>"Hear, hear!" put in Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2239" id="dominics.c0.p2239"><s>"Poor Mr Wraysford!</s> <s>I hope he is not very much disappointed.</s> <s>How nice it would have been if there had been two scholarships, and each could have had one!</s> <s>I suppose the Fifth is making quite a hero of Oliver.</s> <s>I know one foolish old woman who would like to be with her boys this moment to share their triumph."</s> </p>

<p pid="2240" id="dominics.c0.p2240"><s>Oliver laughed bitterly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2241" id="dominics.c0.p2241"><s>"That _would_ be a treat for her!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2242" id="dominics.c0.p2242"><s>Stephen, very red in the face, was too furious for words, so Oliver went on:</s> </p>

<p pid="2243" id="dominics.c0.p2243"><s>"And if, instead of triumph, they should ever be in trouble or sorrow, still more would I love to be with them, to share it.</s> <s>But most of all do I trust and pray they may both make a constant friend of the Saviour, who wants us all to cast our burdens on Him, and follow the example He has left us in all things."</s> </p>

<p pid="2244" id="dominics.c0.p2244"><s>There was a silence for some moments after this home message fell on the brothers' ears.</s> <s>The hearts of both were full--too full for words--but I think, had the widow-mother far away been able to divine the secret thoughts of her boys, hope would have mingled with all her pity and all her solicitude on their account.</s> </p>

<p pid="2245" id="dominics.c0.p2245"><s>But the old trouble, for the present at any rate, was destined to swamp all other emotions.</s> </p>

<p pid="2247" id="dominics.c0.p2247"><s>"Baa!" exclaimed Stephen.</s> <s>"The beast!</s> <s>I'll let her know what sort of blackguard the fellow is!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2265" id="dominics.c0.p2265"><s>Oliver Greenfield's banishment from civilised society, however much it may have gratified the virtuous young gentlemen of the Fifth, was regarded by a small section of fellows in the Sixth with unmitigated disgust.</s> <s>These fellows were the leading spirits of the Saint Dominic Football Club, which was just about to open proceedings for the season.</s> <s>To them the loss of the best half-back in the school was a desperate calamity.</s> </p>

<p pid="2266" id="dominics.c0.p2266"><s>They raged and raved over the matter with all the fury of disappointed enthusiasts.</s> <s>_They_ didn't care a bit, it almost seemed, whether the fellow was a cheat or not.</s> <s>All they knew was, he was the quickest half-back and the safest drop-kick the school had, and here was the match with Landfield coming on, and, lo and behold! their man was in Coventry, forsooth, and not to be had out for love or money.</s> <s>Thus baulked, the Sixth Form athletes could afford to wax very virtuous and philanthropic on the subject of Coventry generally.</s> </p>

<p pid="2267" id="dominics.c0.p2267"><s>"The Doctor ought to put a stop to it," said Stansfield, who this year occupied the proud position of captain of the fifteen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2269" id="dominics.c0.p2269"><s>This was gratifying for Loman, one of the council of war, who usually played quarter or half-back in the matches.</s> </p>

<p pid="2270" id="dominics.c0.p2270" type="speech"><s>"I don't see why we shouldn't get him to play if he _is_ at Coventry," said Callonby; <qs/>"_we_ didn't send him there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2272" id="dominics.c0.p2272" type="speech"><s>"And I shouldn't play either," said Loman, <qs/>"if Greenfield played."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2273" id="dominics.c0.p2273"><s>Stansfield shrugged his shoulders and looked vicious.</s> </p>

<p pid="2274" id="dominics.c0.p2274"><s>"All child's play!" said he.</s> <s>"They think it's very grand and a fine spectacle and all that.</s> <s>But they ought to have more consideration for the credit of the school."</s> </p>

<p pid="2275" id="dominics.c0.p2275" type="speech"><s>"It's not much to the credit of the school," said Loman, <qs/>"to have a fellow like him in the fifteen."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2276" id="dominics.c0.p2276"><s>"It's less credit to have a pack of louts who tumble head over heels every time they try to pick up a ball, and funk a charge twice out of every thrice!" retorted Stansfield, who was one of the peppery order.</s> <s>"Greenfield's worth any half-dozen of you, I tell you."</s> </p>

<p pid="2277" id="dominics.c0.p2277"><s>"Better get him to play Landfield by himself," growled Loman, who generally got the worst of it in discussions like this.</s> </p>

<p pid="2279" id="dominics.c0.p2279" type="speech"><s>"Forrester, in the Fourth, plays a very good half-back," said Callonby; <qs/>"he's tremendously quick on his feet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2289" id="dominics.c0.p2289" type="speech"><s>Stansfield groaned.</s> <s>"There go my two best men," he said; <qs/>"we may as well shut up shop and go in for croquet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2290" id="dominics.c0.p2290"><s>A powerful deputation waited on Wraysford that same evening to try to prevail upon him to play in the fifteen.</s> <s>They had hard work to do it.</s> <s>He said he was out of form, and didn't feel in the humour, and was certain they could get on well enough without him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2291" id="dominics.c0.p2291" type="speech"><s>"Oh, no, we can't," said Stansfield.</s> <s>"I say, Wraysford," he added, bluntly, <qs/>"I expect it's this Nightingale affair's at the bottom of all this nonsense.</s> <s>Can't you possibly patch it up, at any rate till after Saturday?</s> <s>I'd give my head to get you and Greenfield in the team."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2292" id="dominics.c0.p2292"><s>"Do play, Wraysford," put in Callonby.</s> <s>"Don't let the school be beaten just because you've got a row on with another fellow."</s> </p>

<p pid="2293" id="dominics.c0.p2293"><s>"It's not that at all," said Wraysford, feeling and looking very uncomfortable.</s> <s>"It's nothing to do with that.</s> <s>It's just that I'm not in the humour.</s> <s>I'd really rather not."</s> </p>

<p pid="2294" id="dominics.c0.p2294" type="speech"><s>"Oh, look here," cried Stansfield; <qs/>"that won't wash.</s> <s>Come to oblige me, there's a good fellow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2295" id="dominics.c0.p2295"><s>In the end Wraysford gave in, and the captain went off half consoled to complete his preparations, and inveigh in his odd moments against all Nightingales and Coventrys, and examinations, and all such enemies and stumbling-blocks to the glorious old English sport of football.</s> </p>

<p pid="2296" id="dominics.c0.p2296"><s>Loman looked forward to the coming match with quite good spirits.</s> <s>Indeed, it was a long time since he had felt or appeared so light-hearted.</s> </p>

<p pid="2297" id="dominics.c0.p2297" type="speech"><s>That very day he had received a most unexpected present in the shape of a five-pound note from an aunt, which sum he had promptly and virtuously put into an envelope and sent down to Mr Cripps in further liquidation of his <qs/>"little bill."<qe/></s> <s>Was ever such luck?</s> <s>And next week the usual remittance from home would be due; there would be another three or four pounds paid off.</s> <s>Loman felt quite touched at the thought of his own honesty and solvency.</s> <s>If only everybody in the world paid their debts as he did, what a happy state of things it would be for the country!</s> </p>

<p pid="2298" id="dominics.c0.p2298"><s>So, as I said, Loman looked forward to the football match in quite good spirits, just as a man who has been working hard and anxiously for eleven long months looks forward to his well-earned summer holiday.</s> <s>Things were looking up with him, and no mistake.</s> </p>

<p pid="2299" id="dominics.c0.p2299"><s>And then, just like his luck, the Doctor had that same day made the announcement, already referred to, of another scholarship to be competed for directly after Christmas.</s> <s>It was for Sixth form boys under seventeen, and he meant to go in for it!</s> <s>True, this scholarship was only for twenty pounds for a single year, but that was something.</s> <s>As far as he could see, Wraysford, who would get his move up at Christmas, would be the only man in against him, if he did go in, and he fancied he could beat Wraysford.</s> <s>For in the Nightingale exam he had not really tried his best, but this time he would and astonish everybody.</s> <s>Greenfield would scarcely go in for this exam, even if he got his move up; it was safe to conclude his recent exploit would suffice him in the way of exams, for some time to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="2300" id="dominics.c0.p2300"><s>And then, what could be more opportune than its coming off just after Christmas, at the precise time when Cripps would be looking for a final settlement of his account, or whatever little of it remained still to pay!</s> <s>Oh, dear! oh, dear!</s> <s>What a thing it is to be straight and honest!</s> <s>Everything prospers with a man when he goes in for being honest!</s> <s>Why, Loman was positively being bathed in luck at the present time!</s> </p>

<p pid="2301" id="dominics.c0.p2301"><s>The Saturday came at last.</s> <s>Stansfield had drilled his men as well as he could during the interval, and devoutly hoped that he had got a respectable team to cope with the Landfield fellows.</s> <s>If he could only have been sure of his half-back he would have been quite happy; and never a practice passed without his growling louder than ever at the disgraceful custom of sending useful behind-scrimmage men to Coventry.</s> <s>At the last moment he decided to give the responsible post to Loman, rather than move forward Wraysford from his position at "back"; and Loman's usual place at quarter-back was filled up by young Forrester of the Fourth, greatly to that young gentleman's trepidation and to the exultation of the Fourth Senior as a body, who felt terrifically puffed up to have one of their men actually in the first fifteen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2302" id="dominics.c0.p2302" type="speech"><s>Some of my readers may perhaps know from actual experience what are the numerous and serious anxieties which always beset the captain of the football fifteen.</s> <s>If the fellow is worth his salt he knows to a nicety where he is strong and where he is weak; he knows, if the wind blows one way, which is the best quarter-back to put on the left and which on the right.</s> <s>He knows which of his "bulldogs" he can safely put into the middle of the scrimmage, and which are most useful in the second tier.</s> <s>He knows when to call <qs/>"Kick!"<qe/><sls/> to a man and when to call <sle/><qs/>"Run!"<qe/> and no man knows better when to throw the ball far out from touch, or when to nurse it along close to the line.</s> <s>It is all very well for outsiders to talk of football everlastingly as a _game_.</s> <s>My dear, good people, football is a science if ever there was a science; the more you know of it the more you will find that out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2303" id="dominics.c0.p2303"><s>This piece of lecturing is thrown in here for the purpose of observing that Stansfield was a model football captain.</s> <s>However worried and worrying and crabby he was in his ordinary clothes, in his football togs and on the field of battle he was the coolest, quickest, readiest, and cunningest general you could desire.</s> <s>He said no more than he could help, and never scolded his men while play was going on, and, best of all, worked like a horse himself in the thick of the fight, and looked to every one else to do the same.</s> </p>

<p pid="2304" id="dominics.c0.p2304"><s>Yet on this Saturday all the captain's prowess and generalship could not win the match for Saint Dominic's against Landfield.</s> </p>

<p pid="2305" id="dominics.c0.p2305" type="speech"><s>The match began evenly, and for the first half of the time the game was one long succession of scrimmages in the middle of the ground, from which the ball hardly ever escaped, and when it did, escaped only to be driven back next moment into the <qs/>"mush."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2306" id="dominics.c0.p2306"><s>"It'll do at this rate!" thinks Stansfield to himself.</s> <s>"As long as they keep it among the forwards we shan't hurt."</s> </p>

<p pid="2307" id="dominics.c0.p2307"><s>Alas! one might almost have declared some tell-tale evil spirit had heard the boast and carried it to the ear of the enemy, for next moment half-time was called, the sides changed over, and with them the Landfielders completely reversed their tactics.</s> </p>

<p pid="2308" id="dominics.c0.p2308"><s>The game was no longer locked up in a scrimmage in the middle of the ground.</s> <s>It became looser all along the line; the ball began to slip through the struggling feet into the hands of those behind, who sent it shooting over the heads of the forwards into more open ground.</s> <s>The quarter-backs and half-backs on either side ran and got round the scrimmages; and when at last they were collared, took to ending up with an expiring drop-kick, which sent the ball far in the direction of the coveted goals.</s> </p>

<p pid="2309" id="dominics.c0.p2309"><s>Nothing could have happened worse for Saint Dominic's, for the strain fell upon them just at their weakest point.</s> <s>Stansfield groaned as he saw chance after chance missed behind his scrimmages.</s> <s>Young Forrester played pluckily and hard at quarter-back, and shirked nothing; but he could not kick, and his short runs were consequently of little use.</s> <s>Callonby, of course, did good work, but Loman, the half-back, was woefully unsteady.</s> </p>

<p pid="2310" id="dominics.c0.p2310"><s>"What a jackass I was to put the fellow there!" said Stansfield to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="2311" id="dominics.c0.p2311"><s>And yet Loman, as a rule, was a good player, with plenty of dash and not a little courage.</s> <s>It was odd that to-day he should be showing such specially bad form.</s> </p>

<p pid="2324" id="dominics.c0.p2324"><s>The Landfield men were quick enough to see the weak point of their enemies, and make use of the discovery.</s> <s>They played fast and loose, giving the ball not a moment's peace, and above all avoiding scrimmages.</s> <s>The Saint Dominic's forwards were thus made practically useless, and the brunt of the encounter fell on the four or five players behind, and they were not equal to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2352" id="dominics.c0.p2352"><s>Christmas prize-day was always a great event at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>For, as all the examinations had been held at the beginning of the term, all the rewards were naturally distributed at the end of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2358" id="dominics.c0.p2358"><s>In due time the lecture-theatre filled up, crowded from floor to ceiling.</s> <s>The noble Earl walked in amid terrific cheers and took his seat.</s> <s>The Doctor walked in after him, amid cheers almost as terrific, and after him the ordinary procession of governors, masters, and examiners; and when they were all seated prize-day had begun.</s> </p>

<p pid="2359" id="dominics.c0.p2359"><s>For up steps Mr Raleigh, the captain of the school, on to the raised dais, whence, after bowing profoundly to the noble Earl and everybody, he delivers a neat speech in honour of a good old soul who lived three or four centuries ago, and left behind him the parcel of ground on which Saint Dominic's now stands, and a hatful of money besides, to found the school.</s> <s>Raleigh having said his say (and how proud the smallest boys are of the captain's whiskers as they listen!), up steps Wren and commences a similar harangue in Greek.</s> <s>The small boys, of course, cheer this even more than the English.</s> <s>Then up gets Mr Winter and spins off a Latin speech, but this does not go down so well, for the juniors know a _little_ Latin, and so are a good deal more critical over that than over the Greek.</s> <s>The French and German speeches however, restore them to good humour, and then the speeches are done.</s> </p>

<p pid="2412" id="dominics.c0.p2412"><s>CHAPTER THIRTY.</s> <s>A NEW TURN OF THE TIDE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2413" id="dominics.c0.p2413"><s>The three weeks of Christmas holiday darted past only too rapidly for most of the boys at Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>Holidays have a miserable knack of sliding along.</s> <s>The first few days seem delightfully long.</s> <s>Then, after the first week, the middle all of a sudden becomes painfully near.</s> <s>And the middle once passed, they simply tear, and bolt, and rush pitilessly on to the end, when, lo and behold! your time is up before you well knew it had begun.</s> </p>

<p pid="2414" id="dominics.c0.p2414"><s>So it happened with most of the boys.</s> <s>With one or two, however, the holiday dragged heavily, and one of these was Master Thomas Senior.</s> <s>This forlorn youth, no longer now rollicking Tom of the Fifth, but the meek and mild, and withal sulky, hopeful of the Reverend Thomas Senior, D.D., of Saint Dominic's, watched the last of his chums go off with anything but glee.</s> <s>He was doomed to three weeks' kicking of his heels in the empty halls and playgrounds of Saint Dominic's, with nothing to do and no one to do it with.</s> <s>For the boy's mother was ill, which kept the whole family at home, and Tom's baby brother, vivacious youth as he was, was hardly of a companionable age yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2415" id="dominics.c0.p2415"><s>As to the Doctor (Tom, by the way, even in the bosom of his family, always thought and talked of his father as the "Doctor")--as for the Doctor, well, Tom was inclined to shirk the risk of more _tete-a-tetes_ than he could possibly help with so formidable a personage, even though he _was_ his own parent.</s> </p>

<p pid="2416" id="dominics.c0.p2416"><s>But try all he could, Tom was let in for it once, when he found himself face to face one day at dinner with the Doctor, and no third person to help him out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2417" id="dominics.c0.p2417"><s>The occasion was quite early in the holidays, and was indeed about the first opportunity the father had had since breaking-up for anything like a conversation with his affable son.</s> </p>

<p pid="2418" id="dominics.c0.p2418"><s>Tom's conversational powers were never very brilliant, and when in the subduing presence of his father they always dwindled down to nothing.</s> <s>It was, therefore, somewhat difficult, under the circumstances, to keep the talk going, but the Doctor did his best.</s> <s>Tom answered in monosyllables, and looked fearfully sheepish, and found his best policy was always to keep his mouth full, and so have the excuse of good manners on his side for his silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="2419" id="dominics.c0.p2419" type="speech"><s>"Tom," said the Doctor, presently, steering round to a subject which it had been for some time in his mind to question his son about, <qs/>"that was an extraordinary demonstration on prize-day, when Greenfield senior came up to get his scholarship."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2420" id="dominics.c0.p2420"><s>"It wasn't me," said Tom, colouring up.</s> </p>

<p pid="2421" id="dominics.c0.p2421"><s>"My dear boy, I never supposed it was," said the Doctor, laughing.</s> <s>"But it surprised me very much, as well as pained me."</s> </p>

<p pid="2422" id="dominics.c0.p2422"><s>"I couldn't help it," again said Tom.</s> </p>

<p pid="2423" id="dominics.c0.p2423"><s>"Of course you couldn't, Tom.</s> <s>But I am sorry to find Greenfield is so unpopular in the school."</s> </p>

<p pid="2424" id="dominics.c0.p2424"><s>The Doctor did not care to put a direct question to Tom on the matter that was perplexing him.</s> <s>He hoped to draw him out by more indirect means.</s> <s>But he was mistaken if he ever expected it, for Tom, with the perversity of a fellow who _will_ take everything that is said as a rebuke to himself, showed no inclination to follow the lead.</s> <s>The Doctor had, therefore, to ask outright.</s> </p>

<p pid="2425" id="dominics.c0.p2425"><s>"What dreadful crime has he committed, Tom, to be treated so severely?"</s> </p>

<p pid="2426" id="dominics.c0.p2426" type="speech"><s>"I don't want to treat him severely," said Tom.</s> <s>"Tom," said the Doctor, half angrily, <qs/>"you are very foolish.</s> <s>I was not referring to you particularly, but to the whole school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2427" id="dominics.c0.p2427"><s>Tom sulked at this more than ever.</s> <s>_He_ wasn't going to be called foolish.</s> <s>The Doctor, however, tried once more.</s> </p>

<p pid="2428" id="dominics.c0.p2428"><s>"What has he done to offend you all?</s> <s>Has he missed a catch at cricket, or a kick at football?</s> <s>I hope, whatever it is--"</s> </p>

<p pid="2429" id="dominics.c0.p2429"><s>"It isn't me!" once more growled Tom, heartily wishing the meal was over.</s> </p>

<p pid="2430" id="dominics.c0.p2430"><s>The Doctor gave it up as a bad job.</s> <s>There was no use trying to get a rise out of Tom.</s> <s>If that ingenuous youth had been trying to shield his Form, he could not have done it better.</s> <s>As it was, he was only stupidly trying to shield himself, and letting his dread of his "Doctor" father get the better of his common sense and good manners.</s> </p>

<p pid="2431" id="dominics.c0.p2431"><s>Luckily for Tom, a friend wrote to invite him to spend the last week of the holidays in London, an invitation which that youth, as well as his parent for him, thankfully accepted.</s> <s>Indeed, during the holidays Mrs Senior became so ill that the poor Doctor had no thoughts to spare for anybody or anything but her and her hope of recovery.</s> <s>He watched her night and day through all the vicissitudes of her fever, and when at last the crisis was over, and the doctors said she would recover, they said also that unless Dr Senior wanted to have an illness himself he must go away and get perfect rest and change for a week or two at the very least.</s> </p>

<p pid="2432" id="dominics.c0.p2432"><s>The consequence of all this was that Saint Dominic's had to reassemble after the Christmas holidays without the Doctor.</s> </p>

<p pid="2433" id="dominics.c0.p2433"><s>To some of the boys this was sorrowful news; others regarded the circumstance with indifference, while one section there was who received the intelligence with positive joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2434" id="dominics.c0.p2434"><s>Strange that that section should contain in it two such opposites as Loman of the Sixth and Bramble of the Fourth Junior.</s> </p>

<p pid="2435" id="dominics.c0.p2435" type="speech"><s>Loman, despite his <qs/>"run of luck,"<qe/> had spent an uneasy holiday.</s> <s>He had been in constant terror of seeing Cripps every time he ventured outside his house; and he had been in still more terror of Cripps calling up at Saint Dominic's and telling the Doctor all about him directly after the holidays.</s> <s>For now Loman's time was up.</s> <s>Though he had in one way and another paid off all his debt to the landlord of the Cockchafer but eight pounds, still he knew Cripps could make himself quite as unpleasant about eight pounds as about thirty pounds, and probably would.</s> </p>

<p pid="2436" id="dominics.c0.p2436"><s>But as long as the Doctor was away it didn't matter so much.</s> <s>And, besides, the examination for the exhibition would of course be postponed, which meant so much longer time for preparation--which meant so much better chance for Loman of winning it.</s> <s>For, when he tried, he could work hard and effectively.</s> </p>

<p pid="2437" id="dominics.c0.p2437"><s>So Loman was very glad to hear the Doctor was away ill.  So was Bramble!</s> </p>

<p pid="2438" id="dominics.c0.p2438"><s>That youth (who, by the way, had during the holidays quite recovered from the sobering effect of his grandmother's visit to the school) was always on a look-out for escaping the eye of the constituted authorities.</s> <s>He hardly ever saw the Doctor from one month's end to another; but somehow, to know he was away--to know any one was away who ought to be there to look after him--was a glorious opportunity!</s> <s>He launched at once into a series of revolutionary exploits on the strength of it.</s> <s>He organised mutinies ten times a day, and had all the specifications drawn up for blowing up Saint Dominic's with paraffin oil.</s> <s>There was nothing, in short, Bramble would not venture while the Doctor was away; and there is no knowing how far he might have carried his bloodthirsty conspiracies into effect had not Mr Rastle caught him one day with a saw, sawing the legs off the writing-master's stool, and given him such a chastisement, bodily and mental, as induced him for a brief season to retire from public life, and devote all his spare time to copying out an imposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="2439" id="dominics.c0.p2439"><s>On the first morning after reassembling, Mr Jellicott, the master in charge of Saint Dominic's, summoned the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth to meet him in the lecture-theatre, and there announced to them the reason of the head master's absence.</s> </p>

<p pid="2440" id="dominics.c0.p2440" type="speech"><s>"In consequence of this," said Mr Jellicott, <qs/>"the removes gained last term will not be put into force for a week or two, till the head master returns; but, meanwhile, Dr Senior is anxious that the work of the school should go on as usual.</s> <s>We shall, therefore, resume studies to-morrow; and on Monday next the examination for the Waterston Exhibition will be held, as arranged.</s> <s>The three boys--Loman, Greenfield senior, and Wraysford--entered for this will be excused ordinary lessons till after the examination."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2441" id="dominics.c0.p2441"><s>Greenfield senior!</s> <s>Then Oliver _was_ in for it after all!</s> <s>The announcement amazed Wraysford as much as it did Loman and every one else.</s> <s>It had never entered their minds that he would go in for it.</s> <s>Hadn't he got the Nightingale? and wasn't that enough for one half-year?</s> <s>And didn't every one know _how_ he had got it, and how could the fellow now have the assurance to put in for another examination?</s> </p>

<p pid="2442" id="dominics.c0.p2442"><s>Oliver always had been a queer fellow, and this move struck every one as queerer than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="2443" id="dominics.c0.p2443" type="speech"><s>But to Wraysford and one or two others it occurred in a different light.</s> <s>If Oliver had really won the Nightingale in the manner every one suspected, he would hardly now boldly enter for another examination, in which he might possibly not succeed, and so prove those suspicions to be true.</s> <s>For the subjects were almost exactly the same as those examined in for the Nightingale, and unless Oliver did as well here as he did there--and that was _remarkably_ well--it would be open for anybody to say, <qs/>"Of course--he couldn't steal the paper this time, that's why!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2444" id="dominics.c0.p2444" type="speech"><s>Wraysford, as he thought over it, became more and more uneasy and ashamed of himself.</s> <s>One moment he persuaded himself Oliver was a hypocrite, and the next that he was innocent.</s> <s>"At any rate," said he to himself, <qs/>"this examination will settle it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2445" id="dominics.c0.p2445"><s>In due time the examination day came, and once more the three rivals heard their names called upon to come forward and occupy that memorable front desk in the Sixth Form room.</s> </p>

<p pid="2446" id="dominics.c0.p2446"><s>This time at any rate there had been no chance for any one to take an unfair advantage, for the Doctor's papers did not reach Saint Dominic's till the morning of the examination.</s> <s>Indeed, Mr Jellicott was opening the envelope which contained them when the boys entered the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="2447" id="dominics.c0.p2447"><s>Any one closely observing the three boys as they glanced each down his paper would once more have been struck by the strange contrast in their faces.</s> <s>Oliver's, as his eyes glanced rapidly down the page, was composed and immovable; Wraysford's, as he looked first at his paper and then hurriedly at Oliver and Loman, was perplexed and troubled; Loman's was blank and pale and desponding.</s> </p>

<p pid="2448" id="dominics.c0.p2448"><s>But of the three, the happiest that morning was Wraysford--not that he was sure of success, not that his conscience was clear of all reproach, but because, as he sat there, working hard himself and hearing some one's pen on his left flying with familiar sound quickly over the paper, he felt at last absolutely sure that he had misjudged his friend, and equally resolved that, come what would of it, and humiliating as the confession would be, he would, before that day ended, be reconciled to Oliver Greenfield.</s> <s>What mattered it to him, then, who won the exhibition?</s> <s>Loman might win it for all _he_ cared, as long as he won back his friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="2449" id="dominics.c0.p2449"><s>However, Loman at that moment did not look much like winning anything.</s> <s>If he had been in difficulties in the former examination, he was utterly stranded now.</s> <s>He tried first one question, then another, but no inspiration seemed to come; and at last, after dashing off a few lines at random, he laid down his pen, and, burying his face in his hands, gave himself up to his own wretched thoughts.</s> <s>He must see Cripps soon; he must go to him or Cripps would come up to Saint Dominic's, and then--</s> </p>

<p pid="2450" id="dominics.c0.p2450" type="speech"><s>Well, Loman did not do much execution that morning, and was thankful when presently Mr Jellicott said, <qs/>"Time will be up in five minutes, boys."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2451" id="dominics.c0.p2451"><s>The announcement was anything but welcome to the other two competitors, both of whom were writing, hammer and tongs, as though their lives depended on it.</s> <s>Loman looked round at them and groaned as he looked.</s> <s>Why should they be doing so well and he be doing so ill?</s> </p>

<p pid="2452" id="dominics.c0.p2452"><s>"Look at those two beggars!" said Callonby to Stansfield, in a whisper, pointing to Wraysford and Oliver.</s> <s>"There's a neck-and-neck race for you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2453" id="dominics.c0.p2453"><s>So it was.</s> <s>Now Oliver seemed to be getting over the ground quicker, and now Wraysford.</s> <s>Now Wraysford lost a good second by looking up at the clock; now Greenfield made a bad shot with his pen at the inkpot, and had to dip again, which threw him back half a second at least.</s> </p>

<p pid="2454" id="dominics.c0.p2454" type="speech"><s>Unconscious of the interest and amusement they were exciting among the sporting section of the Sixth, they kept the pace up to the finish, and when at last Mr Jellicott said, <qs/>"Cease writing and bring up your papers,"<qe/><sls/> both groaned simultaneously, as much as to say, <sle/><qs/>"A second or two more would have done it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2455" id="dominics.c0.p2455"><s>The examination was over, but the event of that memorable day was still to take place.</s> </p>

<p pid="2456" id="dominics.c0.p2456"><s>Five minutes later Oliver, who had retired alone, as usual, to his study, there to announce to the anxious Stephen how he had fared in the examination, caught the sudden sound of an old familiar footstep outside his door, which sent the blood to his cheeks with strange emotion.</s> <s>Stephen heard it, and knew it too.</s> </p>

<p pid="2457" id="dominics.c0.p2457"><s>"There's that beast Wraysford," he said, at the very instant that Wraysford, not waiting to knock, flung open the door and entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="2458" id="dominics.c0.p2458"><s>There was no need for him to announce his errand.</s> <s>It was written on his face as he advanced with outstretched hand to his old friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="2459" id="dominics.c0.p2459" type="speech"><s>"Noll, old man," was all he could say, as their eyes met, <qs/>"the youngster's right--I _am_ a beast!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2460" id="dominics.c0.p2460"><s>At the first word--the first friendly word spoken to him for months-- Oliver started to his feet like one electrified; and before the sentence was over his hand was tightly grasping the hand of his friend, and Stephen had disappeared from the scene.</s> <s>It is no business of ours to pry into that happy study for the next quarter of an hour.</s> <s>If we did the reader would very likely be disappointed, or perhaps wearied, or perhaps convinced that these two were as great fools in the manner of their making up as they had been in the manner of their falling out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2461" id="dominics.c0.p2461"><s>Oh! the happiness of that precious quarter of an hour, when the veil that has divided two faithful friends is suddenly dashed aside, and they rush one to the other, calling themselves every imaginable bad name in the dictionary, insisting to the verge of quarrelling that it was all their fault, and no fault at all of the other, far too rapturous to talk ordinary common sense, and far too forgetful of everything to remember that they are saying the same thing over and over again every few minutes.</s> </p>

<p pid="2559" id="dominics.c0.p2559"><s>But which of those two was to win?</s> <s>That was the question.</s> <s>Every one but a few had been positive it would be Wraysford, whom they looked upon as the lawful winner of the Nightingale last term, and whom, they were convinced, Oliver was unable to beat by fair means.</s> <s>And yet to these it had been a great astonishment to hear that Oliver had entered for the examination.</s> <s>Unless he was certain of winning he would only do himself harm by it, and confirm the suspicions against him.</s> <s>And yet, if he should win after all--if he was able fairly to beat Wraysford--why should he have gone to the trouble last term of stealing the examination paper and making himself the most unpopular boy in all Saint Dominic's?</s> </p>

<p pid="2563" id="dominics.c0.p2563" type="speech"><s>Here Mr Jellicott was interrupted by a laugh and a muttered <qs/>"Bravo, Loman! very good!"<qe/> in what sounded to the knowing something like Pembury's voice.</s> <s>The master looked up and frowned angrily, and then proceeded:</s> <s>"The examiners add an expression of their very high approval of Greenfield's answers.</s> <s>The highest marks obtainable were 120, and, considering he left the last question untouched--doubtless for want of time--they feel that he has passed with very great distinction, and fully in accordance with their expectations of the winner of the Nightingale Scholarship last term.</s> <s>We will now proceed to the usual lessons."</s> </p>

<p pid="2564" id="dominics.c0.p2564"><s>This announcement made the strangest impression on all present.</s> <s>No one attempted any demonstration, but while Mr Jellicott was speaking many perplexed and troubled faces turned to where Oliver, by the side of his friend Wraysford, was sitting.</s> <s>Wraysford's face was beaming as he clapped his friend on the back.</s> <s>Oliver looked as unconcerned and indifferent as ever.</s> <s>The fellow _was_ a puzzle, certainly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2619" id="dominics.c0.p2619"><s>The Fifth were a good while coming round on the question of Greenfield senior.</s> <s>But the delay was more on account of pride than because they still considered their old class-fellow a knave.</s> <s>They had taken up such a grand position last term, and talked so magnificently about honour, and morality, and the credit of the school, that it was a sad come-down now to have to admit they had all been wrong, and still more that they had all been fools.</s> <s>And yet, after what had happened, they could no longer retain their suspicions of Oliver Greenfield.</s> </p>

<p pid="2620" id="dominics.c0.p2620"><s>A few of the better sort, like Pembury and Bullinger, had the courage, at whatever cost, to act up to their convictions, and declared at once that they had been wrong, and were ashamed of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2621" id="dominics.c0.p2621"><s>The next step was to approach Oliver, and that was more difficult, for he was such a queer fellow there was no knowing where to have him.</s> <s>However, Pembury's wit helped him over the difficulty as usual.</s> </p>

<p pid="2622" id="dominics.c0.p2622"><s>He was hobbling down the passage one morning when he suddenly encountered Oliver and Wraysford, arm-in-arm, approaching him.</s> <s>If at any time in his life Pembury did feel uncomfortable and awkward he felt it now.</s> <s>If he let Oliver go by this time without making it up somehow, the chance might never come again; but how to set about it, that was the difficulty, and every half-second brought the two nearer.</s> <s>Twenty different ideas flashed through his mind.</s> <s>He was not the sort of fellow to go to any one and eat humble-pie straight off.</s> <s>That was far too tame a proceeding.</s> <s>No, there was only one way he could think of, and he would chance that.</s> </p>

<p pid="2623" id="dominics.c0.p2623" type="speech"><s>"Noll, old man," said he, in the old familiar tones, <qs/>"you've got a spare arm.</s> <s>May I take it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2624" id="dominics.c0.p2624" type="speech"><s>Oliver stopped short and looked at him for an instant in astonishment.</s> <s>Next moment, with a hearty <qs/>"Rather!"<qe/> he slipped his arm into that of the happy Pembury, and the three went on their way rejoicing, a sight and a moral for all Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2625" id="dominics.c0.p2625" type="speech"><s>That was the whole of Anthony Pembury's making up.</s> <s>As for Bullinger, he wrote his man a letter, worded in beautiful English, in the most elegant handwriting and punctuated to a nicety, setting forth his contrition, and his hope that Greenfield would henceforth reckon him among his friends--<qs/>"Yours very sincerely, H. Bullinger."<qe/></s> <s>This literary effort he carefully dispatched by a Guinea-pig to its destination, and awaited a reply with the utmost impatience.</s> <s>The reply was laconic, but highly satisfactory.</s> <s>It was a verbal one, given by Oliver himself in class that afternoon, who volunteered the information to the delighted Bullinger that it was a <qs/>"jolly day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2626" id="dominics.c0.p2626"><s>It was indeed a jolly day to that contrite youth.</s> <s>He never believed it would all be got over so easily.</s> <s>He had dreaded all sorts of scenes and lectures and humiliations, but here he was, by a single word, passed back straight into friendship, and no questions asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="2627" id="dominics.c0.p2627"><s>The sight of Oliver surrounded by these three friends, of whom it would have been hard to say which was the happiest, made a deep impression on the rest of the Fifth, and certainly did not tend to make them feel more comfortable as to what they ought to do in a similar direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="2628" id="dominics.c0.p2628"><s>"It's all very well," said Ricketts, when the question was being canvassed for the hundredth time among his immediate friends.</s> <s>"I dare say they are all right, but it makes it jolly uncomfortable for us."</s> </p>

<p pid="2632" id="dominics.c0.p2632" type="speech"><s>"Shut up, you great booby!" cried Ricketts; <qs/>"who asked _you_ anything about it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2633" id="dominics.c0.p2633"><s>Simon modestly retired hereupon, and Braddy took up the talk.</s> </p>

<p pid="2634" id="dominics.c0.p2634"><s>"Yes, who did take the paper? that's it.</s> <s>Greenfield must have done it.</s> <s>Why, he as good as admitted it last term."</s> </p>

<p pid="2635" id="dominics.c0.p2635"><s>"Well, then, it's very queer those fellows making up to him," said Ricketts.</s> <s>"It's no use our trying to send the fellow to Coventry when the others don't back us up."</s> </p>

<p pid="2636" id="dominics.c0.p2636" type="speech"><s>"Wraysford always was daft about Greenfield," said Tom Senior, <qs/>"but I am astonished at Pembury and Bullinger."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2638" id="dominics.c0.p2638" type="speech"><s>"And do you know," said Ricketts, <qs/>"I heard to-day he is down to play in the match against the County."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2639" id="dominics.c0.p2639" type="speech"><s>"Is he?" exclaimed Braddy in excitement; <qs/>"very well, then.</s> <s>_I_ shall not play if he does.</s> <s>That's all about that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2640" id="dominics.c0.p2640"><s>Ricketts laughed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2641" id="dominics.c0.p2641"><s>"Awfully sorry, old man, but you're not in the fifteen this time."</s> </p>

<p pid="2642" id="dominics.c0.p2642"><s>Braddy's face was a picture at this moment--he turned red and blue and white in his astonishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="2643" id="dominics.c0.p2643"><s>"What!" he exclaimed, as soon as he could find words.</s> <s>"I'm not in the team!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2644" id="dominics.c0.p2644"><s>"You'll see the list on the notice board; you'd better go and look."</s> </p>

<p pid="2645" id="dominics.c0.p2645"><s>Off went the wretched Braddy to be convinced of his fate.</s> </p>

<p pid="2646" id="dominics.c0.p2646"><s>"You're in the team, Ricketts, I see," said Tom Senior.</s> <s>"Shall _you_ play if Greenfield does?"</s> </p>

<p pid="2647" id="dominics.c0.p2647"><s>"Don't know," said Ricketts.</s> <s>"A fellow doesn't get a chance to play against the County every day.</s> <s>It's precious awkward."</s> </p>

<p pid="2648" id="dominics.c0.p2648"><s>"So it is; that's just where we began, too," said Tom, philosophically.</s> <s>And, as a matter of fact, whenever these young gentlemen of the Fifth started the subject of Greenfield senior among themselves, they always found themselves in the end at the identical place from which they had set out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2649" id="dominics.c0.p2649"><s>Nor were they the only boys at Saint Dominic's in this dilemma.</s> <s>The Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were equally taken aback by the new aspect of affairs.</s> <s>These young gentlemen had looked upon Oliver's "row" with his class as a peculiar mercy designed specially for their benefit.</s> <s>They had hardly known such a happy time as that during which the row had lasted.</s> <s>Did they want a pretext for a battle?</s> <s>Greenfield senior was a glorious bone of contention.</s> <s>Did they want an object for an indignation meeting?</s> <s>What better object could they have than Greenfield senior?</s> <s>Did they want an excuse generally for laziness, disobedience, and tumult?</s> <s>Greenfield senior served for this too.</s> <s>Indeed, the name of the Fifth Form Martyr had passed into a household word among the lower school, either of glory or reproach, and round it the small fry rallied, as round an old flag of battle.</s> </p>

<p pid="2650" id="dominics.c0.p2650"><s>But now, both friend and foe were aghast.</s> <s>To the Guinea-pigs half the charm of their position had been that they were Greenfield senior's sole champions in all Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>While every one else avoided him, they stuck to him, week-days and Sundays.</s> <s>Now, however, they discovered, with something like consternation, that they no longer had the field to themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="2651" id="dominics.c0.p2651"><s>The sight of Greenfield senior walking down the passage one day, arm-in-arm with Wraysford, and the next day with one arm in Wraysford's and the other in Pembury's, and the day after between Pembury and Bullinger, with Wraysford and Stephen in the rear, struck bewilderment and bitter jealousy to their hearts.</s> </p>

<p pid="2652" id="dominics.c0.p2652"><s>They had come out into the passage to cheer, but they went away silently and sadly, feeling that their very occupation was departed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2653" id="dominics.c0.p2653"><s>Bramble, always quick to see a chance, took advantage as usual of this panic.</s> </p>

<p pid="2654" id="dominics.c0.p2654"><s>"Hullo, I say, Guinea-pigs, you can shut up shop now, you know.</s> <s>We're going to let off Greenfield senior this time, ain't we, Padger?</s> <s>Jolly fellow, Greenfield senior."</s> </p>

<p pid="2655" id="dominics.c0.p2655"><s>This was abominable!</s> <s>To have their hero and idol thus calmly taken out of their hands and appropriated by a set of sneaking Tadpoles was more than human patience could endure!</s> </p>

<p pid="2656" id="dominics.c0.p2656"><s>"Bah!</s> <s>A lot he'll care for _your_ letting him off!" exclaimed Paul, in dire contempt.</s> <s>"He wouldn't touch you with a shovel."</s> </p>

<p pid="2657" id="dominics.c0.p2657"><s>"Oh, yes, he would, though, wouldn't he, Padger?</s> <s>And what do you think, Guinea-pigs?</s> <s>_we're going to get Greenfield senior to take the chair at one of our meetings_!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2658" id="dominics.c0.p2658"><s>Bramble came out with the last triumphant announcement with a positive shout, which made the hearts of his adversaries turn cold.</s> <s>In vain they laughed the idea to scorn; in vain they argued that if for the last six months he had never said a word even to the Guinea-pigs, he would hardly now come and take up with the Tadpoles.</s> <s>Bramble and Padger insisted on their story.</s> </p>

<p pid="2659" id="dominics.c0.p2659" type="speech"><s>"Now, you fellows," concluded Bramble, at the end of another oration; <qs/>"those who say three cheers for Greenfield senior hold up--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2660" id="dominics.c0.p2660"><s>The infuriated Paul here hurled the cap of a brother Guinea-pig, who was standing near him, full at the face of the speaker, who thereupon, altering the current of his observations, descended from his form and "went for" his opponent.</s> </p>

<p pid="2661" id="dominics.c0.p2661"><s>From that day a keener war raged round the head of Greenfield senior than ever.</s> <s>Not of attack and defence of his character, but of rivalry as to whom should be accounted his foremost champions.</s> </p>

<p pid="2662" id="dominics.c0.p2662"><s>It was at this critical period in the history of Saint Dominic's that a new number of the _Dominican_ came out.</s> <s>Pembury had been compelled to write it nearly all himself, for, in the present state of divided feeling in the Fifth, he found it harder than ever to get contributions.</s> </p>

<p pid="2663" id="dominics.c0.p2663"><s>Even those of his own way of thinking, Oliver, Wraysford, and Bullinger, begged to be let off, and, indeed, the two former ingeniously pleaded that, as they were now really Sixth Form fellows (though remaining in their old class till the Doctor came home), they had no right to have a hand in the Fifth Form magazine.</s> <s>And their conscientious scruples on this ground were so strong that no persuasions of Anthony's could shake them.</s> <s>So the unlucky editor had finally, as on a previous occasion, to retire into private life for a season, and get the whole thing out himself, with only the aid of a few inches of "Sonits" from Simon.</s> </p>

<p pid="2664" id="dominics.c0.p2664" type="speech"><s>But <qs/>"what man has done man can do,"<qe/> and this time the editor's efforts were crowned with no less success than on the former occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="2665" id="dominics.c0.p2665"><s>The _Dominican_ certainly did not seem to have lost its novelty, to judge by the crowd which once more assembled outside the classic portals of the Fifth, to peruse the contents of the now familiar big oak frame.</s> </p>

<p pid="2666" id="dominics.c0.p2666"><s>"School News" was the first item of Tony's bill of fare.</s> </p>

<p pid="2667" id="dominics.c0.p2667"><s>After announcing in appropriate terms the Doctor's illness, and "universal hope of seeing him back in all his former vigour" (one or two boys whistled low as they read this, and thought the editor might at least have been content to "speak for himself"), Anthony went on to announce the various school events which had happened since the publication of the last number.</s> <s>Christmas prize-day of course came in for a good share of the description, and contained a touch-off for everybody.</s> </p>

<p pid="2668" id="dominics.c0.p2668" type="speech"><s>"The Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles," said the _Dominican_, <qs/>"looked quite unearthly in their cleanliness.</s> <s>It was commonly reported that one or two of them had washed their faces twice in one week.</s> <s>But this is hardly credible.</s> <s>It is, however, a fact that Bramble was shut up in his study for half an hour with his grandmother and a basin of hot water, and that the conclusion come to from the yells and shrieks which proceeded from the torture-chamber that evening, and the appearance of the dear child next day, is that he undoubtedly underwent one scrubbing this term."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2669" id="dominics.c0.p2669"><s>Bramble's face turned so purple at the reading of this that it was impossible to say whether or not any traces of the scouring still remained.</s> <s>He favoured Paul, who stood in front of him, with a furious kick, which that young gentleman, always punctual in his obligations, promptly repaid, and the two combatants somehow managed to miss a good deal of what immediately followed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2670" id="dominics.c0.p2670"><s>After describing the other incidents of prize-day, the _Dominican_ went on as follows:</s> </p>

<p pid="2671" id="dominics.c0.p2671"><s>"But the event of the day was the presentation of the Nightingale Scholarship, which will be sufficiently fresh in our readers' memories to need no comment here, save this one word--that the only Dominican who behaved himself like a gentleman during that remarkable scene was the winner of the scholarship himself!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2672" id="dominics.c0.p2672"><s>This was coming round with a vengeance!</s> <s>The Fifth had half expected it, and now they felt more uncomfortable than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="2673" id="dominics.c0.p2673"><s>Nor did the succeeding paragraphs leave them much chance of recovery.</s> </p>

<p pid="2674" id="dominics.c0.p2674"><s>"The Waterston Exhibition, our readers will be glad to hear, has been won--and won brilliantly--by Oliver Greenfield, now of the Sixth.</s> <s>No fellow in Saint Dominic's deserves the honour better."</s> </p>

<p pid="2675" id="dominics.c0.p2675"><s>Then, as if his penitence were not yet complete, Pembury went on boldly farther on:</s> </p>

<p pid="2676" id="dominics.c0.p2676"><s>"Speaking of Greenfield senior, it is time some of us who have been doing him injustice for a whole term did what little we could to make amends now.</s> <s>So here goes.</s> <s>Take notice, all of you, that we, the undersigned, are heartily ashamed of our conduct to Greenfield senior, and desire all Saint Dominic's to know it.</s> <s>Signed, A. Pembury, H. Wraysford, T. Bullinger."</s> </p>

<p pid="2677" id="dominics.c0.p2677"><s>The effect of this manifesto was curious.</s> <s>Pembury himself had been unable to prophesy how it would be taken.</s> <s>The boys in front of the board, as they heard it read out, couldn't tell exactly whether to laugh or be serious over the paragraph.</s> <s>Most, however, did the latter, and hurried on to the next sentence:</s> </p>

<p pid="2678" id="dominics.c0.p2678"><s>"The following are also ashamed of themselves, but don't like to say so.</s> <s>The _Dominican_ means to give them a leg up:--Tom Senior, G. Ricketts, R. Braddy, and the rest of the Fifth, except Simon, who never was or could be ashamed of himself while he lived to write such pathetic, soul-stirring lines as the following `Sonits:'"</s> </p>

<p pid="2679" id="dominics.c0.p2679"><s>[It was a great relief to one or two who stood by that Pembury had thus cunningly gone on from grave to gay, and left no pause after the very awkward paragraph about the Fifth.]</s> </p>

<p pid="2690" id="dominics.c0.p2690"><s>This was beautiful.</s> <s>Saint Dominic's was beginning to appreciate poetry at last!</s> <s>Simon was positively delirious with triumph when, after the burst of laughter (he called it applause) which greeted the reading of this gem, some one cried out--</s> </p>

<p pid="2704" id="dominics.c0.p2704"><s>This paragraph so grievously incensed the honourable community at which it was directed, that for the first time for some months Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles made common cause to protest against the base insinuations it contained.</s> </p>

<p pid="2705" id="dominics.c0.p2705"><s>The "meeting" in the Fourth Junior that afternoon lasted, on and off, from half-past four to half-past eight.</s> <s>Among the speakers were Bramble, Paul, and Stephen; while Padger, Walker, and Rook did very good execution with their fists.</s> <s>About half-past seven the dust was so dense that it was impossible to see across the room; but those who knew reported that there was another row on about Greenfield senior, and that Paul and Padger were having their twenty-seventh round!</s> <s>Anyhow, the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles missed the rest of the _Dominican_, which, however, only contained one other paragraph of special interest:</s> </p>

<p pid="2706" id="dominics.c0.p2706"><s>"To-morrow week the football match of the season, School against County, will be played in the Saint Dominic's meadow.</s> <s>We are glad to say the School team will be a crack one, including this time Greenfield senior, and excluding one or two of the `incompetents' of last term.</s> <s>The following is the school fifteen:--Stansfield (football captain), Brown, Winter, Callonby, Duncan, Ricketts, T.

<p pid="2707" id="dominics.c0.p2707"><s>This announcement was interesting in more than one respect.</s> <s>Greenfield _was_ in the team, Loman was _not_.</s> </p>

<p pid="2709" id="dominics.c0.p2709"><s>It is now time to return to Loman, whom we left two chapters ago, with his usual luck, standing in Greenfield's study with the 8 pounds in his hand which was finally to clear him of all his troubles, set him once for all on his feet again, and take such a weight off his mind as ought to leave him the lightest-hearted boy in all Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2710" id="dominics.c0.p2710"><s>He stood there for a minute or two after Oliver and Wraysford had left the room, too bewildered to collect his thoughts or realise one-half of his good fortune, for he had come to Oliver in his extremity as a desperate chance, fully expecting an angry rebuff--or, at best, a chilling snub.</s> <s>But to get through the interview like this, and find the money in his hand within three minutes of his entering the room--why, it quite took his breath away.</s> </p>

<p pid="2711" id="dominics.c0.p2711"><s>Oliver Greenfield _was_ a queer, unaccountable fellow, and no mistake!</s> </p>

<p pid="2712" id="dominics.c0.p2712"><s>Yet, strange to say, when Loman did come to himself he did not burst out into a rapture of delight and gratitude.</s> <s>On the contrary, he suddenly felt himself growing to such a pitch of misery and low spirits as even in the worst of his troubles he had never experienced.</s> <s>He repented bitterly of ever bringing himself to come and ask such a favour of his worst enemy, and, stranger than all, he felt his dislike for Greenfield increased rather than swept away by this abrupt, startling piece of generosity.</s> <s>Strange the whims that seize us!</s> <s>Loman would almost have been happier in his old suspense about Cripps than to feel he owed such a debt to such a creditor.</s> </p>

<p pid="2713" id="dominics.c0.p2713"><s>However, the thought of Cripps, his other creditor, flashed suddenly through his mind at that moment, so, closing his hand over the money, he turned moodily and left the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="2714" id="dominics.c0.p2714"><s>At any rate, he would get clear of Cripps now he had the chance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2715" id="dominics.c0.p2715"><s>As soon as ever morning school was over he took his hat and traversed once more the familiar road between Saint Dominic's and the Cockchafer.</s> <s>"Is Cripps at home?" he inquired of the potboy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2719" id="dominics.c0.p2719"><s>The very potboys despised and ridiculed him!</s> </p>

<p pid="2720" id="dominics.c0.p2720"><s>Loman waited patiently for a quarter of an hour, when the boy returned.</s> </p>

<p pid="2721" id="dominics.c0.p2721" type="speech"><s>"Oh!" said he, <qs/>"the governor can't see you, he says.</s> <s>He's a-smoking his pipe, he says, and he ain't a-goin' to put himself about, he says, for the likes of you.</s> <s>That's what he says!</s> <s>Ti ridde tol rol ro!"<qe/> and here the youth indulged in a spitefully cheerful carol as he resumed the polishing of the mugs.</s> </p>

<p pid="2722" id="dominics.c0.p2722" type="speech"><s>"Look here!" said Loman, miserable and half frightened, <qs/>"tell him I _must_ see him; I've got some money for him, tell him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2723" id="dominics.c0.p2723"><s>"No! have you?" said the boy.</s> <s>"Well, wait till I've done this here job--I'm dead on this here job, I am!</s> <s>You can keep, you can."</s> </p>

<p pid="2724" id="dominics.c0.p2724"><s>This was too much even for the dispirited and cowed Loman.</s> <s>He caught the impudent boy a box on the ear, which resounded all over the Cockchafer, and sent him howling and yelling to his master.</s> </p>

<p pid="2725" id="dominics.c0.p2725"><s>Cripps appeared at last in a fury.</s> <s>What, he demanded, with half a dozen oaths, did Loman mean by coming there and assaulting him and his assistants?</s> <s>"What do you mean, you thieving jackanapes, you!</s> <s>Get out of my shop, do you hear? or I'll get some one in who will help you out!</s> <s>_I'll_ teach you to come here and make yourself at home, you lying--"</s> </p>

<p pid="2726" id="dominics.c0.p2726"><s>"Now, Cripps," began Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="2727" id="dominics.c0.p2727"><s>"Hold your noise! do you hear?" said Cripps, savagely.</s> </p>

<p pid="2728" id="dominics.c0.p2728" type="speech"><s>"I'm very sorry, Cripps," said the wretched boy; <qs/>"I didn't mean to hurt him, but he--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2729" id="dominics.c0.p2729"><s>"Oh! you won't go, won't you?</s> <s>Very good! we'll see if we can make you;" and Cripps departed from the bar, leaving his young "patron" in anything but a comfortable frame of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2730" id="dominics.c0.p2730"><s>For once in a way, however, Loman was roused, and would not go.</s> <s>The boy--miserable specimen as he was--had some courage in him, and when once goaded up to the proper pitch it came out.</s> <s>If he went, he argued to himself, Cripps would certainly come up to Saint Dominic's after him.</s> <s>If he waited till the police or some of the roughs came and ejected him he could not be much worse off; and there was a chance that, by remaining, he might still be able to pacify his evil genius.</s> </p>

<p pid="2731" id="dominics.c0.p2731"><s>So he stayed.</s> <s>Another quarter of an hour passed; no one came to turn him out.</s> <s>A few customers came into the bar and were served by the sulky potboy, but there was no sign of Cripps.</s> </p>

<p pid="2732" id="dominics.c0.p2732"><s>"Go and tell your master I'm here still, and want to see him particularly," said Loman, presently, to the boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2733" id="dominics.c0.p2733"><s>The boy looked up and scowled and rubbed his ear, but somehow that timely blow of Loman's had wrought wonders with his spirit, for he quietly went off and did as he was bid.</s> </p>

<p pid="2734" id="dominics.c0.p2734" type="speech"><s>In a few minutes he came back and delivered the laconic message, <qs/>"You're got to wait."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2735" id="dominics.c0.p2735"><s>This was satisfactory as far as it went.</s> <s>Loman did wait, simmering inwardly all the time, and not wholly losing his desperation before once again Cripps appeared and beckoned him inside.</s> </p>

<p pid="2736" id="dominics.c0.p2736"><s>"Here's the rest of the money," said Loman, hurriedly.</s> <s>"You can give me back the bill now, Cripps."</s> </p>

<p pid="2737" id="dominics.c0.p2737"><s>Cripps took up the money, counted it and pocketed it, and then turned on his victim with an impudent smile.</s> </p>

<p pid="2738" id="dominics.c0.p2738"><s>"Give me the bill," repeated Loman, suddenly turning pale with the dreadful misgiving that after all he had not got rid of the blackguard.</s> </p>

<p pid="2739" id="dominics.c0.p2739"><s>"What do you want the bill for?" asked Cripps, laughing.</s> </p>

<p pid="2740" id="dominics.c0.p2740"><s>"Want it for?</s> <s>Why, Cripps--" and here Loman stopped short.</s> </p>

<p pid="2741" id="dominics.c0.p2741"><s>"Fire away," said Cripps.</s> </p>

<p pid="2742" id="dominics.c0.p2742"><s>"I've paid you all I owe," said Loman, trembling.</s> </p>

<p pid="2743" id="dominics.c0.p2743"><s>"What if you have?"</s> </p>

<p pid="2744" id="dominics.c0.p2744"><s>"Then give me back that bill!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2745" id="dominics.c0.p2745"><s>Cripps only laughed--a laugh which drove the boy frantic.</s> <s>The villain was going to play him false after all.</s> <s>He had got the money, every farthing of it, and now he was going to retain the bill which contained Loman's promise to pay the whole amount!</s> <s>Poor Loman, he was no match in cunning for this rogue.</s> <s>Who would believe him that he had paid, when Cripps was still able to produce the promise signed with his own name to do so?</s> </p>

<p pid="2746" id="dominics.c0.p2746"><s>Bitterly did the boy repent the day when first, by a yielding to deceit, he had put himself in the power of such a villain!</s> </p>

<p pid="2747" id="dominics.c0.p2747" type="speech"><s>He was too confounded and panic-struck to attempt either argument or persuasion.</s> <s>He felt himself ruined, and muttering, in a voice which trembled with misery, <qs/>"I must tell father all about it,"<qe/> he turned to go.</s> </p>

<p pid="2748" id="dominics.c0.p2748"><s>Oh, Loman!</s> <s>Why have you left such a resolve till now?</s> <s>Why, like that other prodigal, have you waited till everything else has failed, till your own resources and cunning have been exhausted to the last dregs, before you turn and say this!</s> </p>

<p pid="2749" id="dominics.c0.p2749"><s>The boy uttered the words involuntarily, not intending that they should be heard.</s> <s>Little he thought Cripps or any one would heed them.</s> <s>But Cripps did heed them.</s> <s>His quick ear caught the words, and they _had_ a meaning for him; for he might be able to cheat and browbeat and swindle a boy, but when it came to dealing no longer with the boy, but with the boy's father, Cripps was sharp enough to know that was a very different matter.</s> <s>He had relied on the boy's fears of exposure and his dread of his father's anger to carry his extortions to the utmost limit with confidence.</s> <s>But now he had gone a step too far.</s> <s>When, in his desperation, the boy naturally turned to the very being he had all along most carefully kept ignorant of his proceedings, it was time for Cripps to pull up.</s> </p>

<p pid="2750" id="dominics.c0.p2750" type="speech"><s>He stopped Loman as he was going away, with a laugh, as he said, in his old tones, <qs/>"Steady there, young gentleman, what a hurry you are in!</s> <s>A man can't have a little bit of fun, just to see how you like it, but there you go, and give it all up, and go and get yourself into a regular perspiration!</s> <s>Tell the governor, indeed!</s> <s>You don't suppose I'd let you get yourself into such a mess as all that, do you?</s> <s>No, no.</s> <s>You shall have the bill, my man, never fear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2751" id="dominics.c0.p2751"><s>"Oh, thank you, Cripps, thank you!" cried Loman, in a sudden convulsion of gratitude and relief.</s> </p>

<p pid="2752" id="dominics.c0.p2752"><s>"'Pon my word, I might take offence, that I might, at your wanting the paper.</s> <s>As if _I'd_ ever take advantage of a young gentleman like you!</s> <s>No, no; honesty's the best policy for us poor folks as well as for you nobs.</s> <s>No one can say I defrauded any one."</s> </p>

<p pid="2753" id="dominics.c0.p2753"><s>"Oh, no, of course not," cried Loman, enthusiastically.</s> <s>"I should like to see any one who did!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2754" id="dominics.c0.p2754"><s>Mr Cripps, smiling sweetly and modestly, went to his cupboard, and after a good deal of fumbling and search, produced the little slip of blue paper he was looking for.</s> </p>

<p pid="2755" id="dominics.c0.p2755"><s>"Is that it?" cried the excited Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="2756" id="dominics.c0.p2756" type="speech"><s>"Looks like it," said Cripps, unfolding it and reading out, with his back to the boy, <qs/>"`Three months after date I promise to pay George Cripps thirty-five pounds, value received.</s> <s>Signed, E.

<p pid="2757" id="dominics.c0.p2757"><s>And so saying, Mr Cripps first tore the paper up into little bits, and then threw the whole into the fire before the eyes of the delighted Loman.</s> </p>

<p pid="2758" id="dominics.c0.p2758"><s>"Thanks, Cripps, thanks," said the boy.</s> <s>"I am so glad everything's settled now, and I am so sorry to have kept you waiting so long."</s> </p>

<p pid="2759" id="dominics.c0.p2759"><s>"Oh, well, as long as it's been an obligement to you, I don't so much care," said the virtuous Cripps.</s> <s>"And now you've done with me I suppose you'll cut me dead, eh, young gentleman?</s> <s>Just the way.</s> <s>You stick to us as long as you can get anything out of us, and then we're nobodies."</s> </p>

<p pid="2760" id="dominics.c0.p2760"><s>And here Mr Cripps looked very dejected.</s> </p>

<p pid="2761" id="dominics.c0.p2761" type="speech"><s>"Oh, no," said Loman, <qs/>"I don't mean to cut you, Cripps.</s> <s>I shall come down now and then--really I will--when I can manage it.</s> <s>Good-bye now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2762" id="dominics.c0.p2762"><s>And he held out his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="2763" id="dominics.c0.p2763"><s>Foolish and wicked as Loman was, there was still left in him some of that boyish generosity which makes one ready to forget injuries and quick to acknowledge a good turn.</s> <s>Loman forgot for a moment all the hideous past, with its suspense and humiliations and miseries, and remembered only that Cripps had torn up the bill and allowed him to clear off accounts once for all at the hated Cockchafer.</s> <s>Alas! he had forgotten, too, about telling all to his father!</s> </p>

<p pid="2764" id="dominics.c0.p2764"><s>"Good-day, young gentleman," said Cripps, with a pensive face which made the boy quite sorry to see.</s> </p>

<p pid="2765" id="dominics.c0.p2765"><s>He shook hands cordially and gratefully, and departed lighter in heart than he had felt for some time.</s> </p>

<p pid="2766" id="dominics.c0.p2766"><s>But as he returned to Saint Dominic's the thought of Oliver, and of his debt to him, returned, and turned again all his satisfaction into vexation.</s> <s>He wished he had the money that moment to fling back into the fellow's face!</s> </p>

<p pid="2767" id="dominics.c0.p2767"><s>I don't pretend to explain this whim of Loman's.</s> <s>It may have been his conscience which prompted it.</s> <s>For a mean person nearly always detests an honest one, and the more open and generous the one is, the meaner the other feels in his own heart by contrast.</s> </p>

<p pid="2768" id="dominics.c0.p2768"><s>However, for some days Loman had not the painful reminder of his debt often before his eyes; for as long as the Doctor was absent Oliver remained in the Fifth.</s> </p>

<p pid="2769" id="dominics.c0.p2769"><s>At length, however, the head master returned, restored and well, and immediately the "removes" were put into force, and Oliver and Wraysford found themselves duly installed on the lowest bench of the Sixth--the only other occupant of which was Loman.</s> <s>The two friends, however, held very little intercourse with their new class-fellow, and Oliver never once referred to the eight pounds; and, like every one and everything else, Loman grew accustomed to the idea of being his rival's debtor, and, as the days went on, ceased to be greatly troubled by the fact at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="2770" id="dominics.c0.p2770"><s>But an event happened one day, shortly after the Doctor's return, which gave every one something else to think about besides loans and debtors.</s> </p>

<p pid="2771" id="dominics.c0.p2771"><s>It was the morning of the day fixed for the great football match against the County, and every one, even the Sixth and Fifth, chafed somewhat at the two hours appointed on such a day for so mundane an occupation as lessons.</s> </p>

<p pid="2772" id="dominics.c0.p2772"><s>Who could think of lessons when any minute the County men might turn up?</s> <s>Who could be bothered with dactyls and spondees when goal-posts and touch-lines were far more to the point?</s> <s>And who could be expected to fix his mind on hexameters and elegiacs when the height of human perfection lay in a straight drop-kick or a fast double past the enemy's half-backs?</s> <s>However, the Doctor had made up his mind Latin verses should get their share of attention that morning, and the two head forms were compelled to submit as best they could.</s> </p>

<p pid="2773" id="dominics.c0.p2773"><s>Now, on this occasion, the Doctor was specially interested in the subject in hand, and waxed more than usually eloquent over the comparative beauties of Horace and Virgil and Ovid, and went into the minutest details about their metres.</s> <s>Over one line which contained what seemed to be a false quantity he really became excited.</s> </p>

<p pid="2774" id="dominics.c0.p2774" type="speech"><s>"It is a most remarkable thing, and I am really pleased we have fallen on the passage," said he, <qs/>"that this identical mistake, if it is a mistake, occurs in a line of Juvenal; it is in the--dear me, I have forgotten how it begins!</s> <s>Has any one here a Juvenal?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2775" id="dominics.c0.p2775"><s>"I have one in my study, sir," said Loman.</s> <s>(Juvenal had been one of the Latin subjects for the Nightingale.)</s> </p>

<p pid="2777" id="dominics.c0.p2777"><s>Loman rose and went for the book, which he found upon his bookcase, enjoying a dignified and dusty repose on the top shelf.</s> <s>Carefully brushing off the dust, so as to give the volume a rather less unused look, he returned with it to the class-room, and handed it to the Doctor.</s> </p>

<p pid="2778" id="dominics.c0.p2778"><s>"Thank you, Loman.</s> <s>Now, it is in the Fourth--no, the Fifth Satire," said he, turning over the pages.</s> <s>"Let me see--yes, not far from--ah!"</s> </p>

<p pid="2779" id="dominics.c0.p2779"><s>This last exclamation was uttered in a voice which made every boy in the room look suddenly up and fix his eyes on the Doctor.</s> <s>It was evidently something more than an exclamation of recognition on finding the desired passage.</s> <s>There was too much surprise and too much pain in the word for that.</s> </p>

<p pid="2780" id="dominics.c0.p2780"><s>Was the Doctor ill?</s> <s>He closed the book and sat back in his chair in a sort of bewilderment.</s> <s>Then suddenly, and with an evident effort, recovering himself, he let his eyes once more rest on the closed Juvenal.</s> </p>

<p pid="2782" id="dominics.c0.p2782"><s>Loman obeyed, much wondering, notwithstanding, why the Doctor should ask him, of all people, to come up and turn to the passage.</s> </p>

<p pid="2783" id="dominics.c0.p2783"><s>He advanced to the head master's desk and took up the Juvenal.</s> </p>

<p pid="3050" id="dominics.c0.p3050"><s>In answer to Mr Rastle's inquiries, he made no secret of his belief that the boy had run away for fear of exposure.</s> </p>

<p pid="3052" id="dominics.c0.p3052"><s>Mr Rastle had no opinion to offer on this question of morals.</s> <s>What he wanted to know was whether Cripps had seen the boy that day, or had the slightest idea what had become of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3053" id="dominics.c0.p3053"><s>Mr Cripps laughed at the idea.</s> </p>

<p pid="3054" id="dominics.c0.p3054" type="speech"><s>"Not likely," he said, <qs/>"he'd tell me where he was a-goin' to, when he'd got thirty-five-pound of mine in his pocket, the young thief.</s> <s>All I can say is, he'd better not show up again in a hurry till that little bill's squared up."<qe/></s> <s>And here Mr Cripps relapsed into quite a state of righteous indignation.</s> </p>

<p pid="3055" id="dominics.c0.p3055"><s>"Wait till he do come back, I says," he repeated.</s> <s>"I'll be on him, mister, no error.</s> <s>I'll let the folks know the kind of young gents you turn out up at your school, so I will."</s> </p>

<p pid="3057" id="dominics.c0.p3057" type="speech"><s>"Thirty-five pounds," continued Cripps, becoming quite sentimental over his wrongs, <qs/>"and if you won't believe me, look at this.</s> <s>This here bit of paper's all I've got in return for my money--all I've got!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3058" id="dominics.c0.p3058"><s>And so saying he took from his pocket and exhibited to Mr Rastle the very promissory note, signed by Loman, which he had pretended to tear up and burn the last time that unhappy boy was at the Cockchafer.</s> </p>

<p pid="3060" id="dominics.c0.p3060"><s>"He really owed you this?" he asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="3061" id="dominics.c0.p3061"><s>"He did so--every brass farthing, which I've waited ever since Michaelmas for it, mister.</s> <s>But I ain't a-going to wait no longer.</s> <s>I must have my money slap down, I let you know, or somebody shall hear of it."</s> </p>

<p pid="3062" id="dominics.c0.p3062"><s>"But he has paid you something?" said Mr Rastle, remembering Oliver's account of the loan of eight pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="3063" id="dominics.c0.p3063"><s>"Has he?" exclaimed Cripps, satirically.</s> <s>"Oh, that's all right, only I ain't seen it, that's all."</s> </p>

<p pid="3064" id="dominics.c0.p3064"><s>"Do you mean he hasn't paid you anything?" demanded Mr Rastle, becoming impatient with his jocular manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3065" id="dominics.c0.p3065"><s>"Of course, as you says so, it ain't for me to say the contrairy; but if you hadn't told me, I should have said he ain't paid me one brass farthing, so now."</s> </p>

<p pid="3066" id="dominics.c0.p3066"><s>"Dear me, dear me!" exclaimed Mr Rastle.</s> <s>Of course, if that was so, Loman must have borrowed the eight pounds from Oliver on false pretences, and kept it for his own use.</s> </p>

<p pid="3067" id="dominics.c0.p3067" type="speech"><s>"I tell you what," broke in Mr Cripps, in the midst of this meditation, <qs/>"I don't want to do nothing unpleasant to you, or the governor, or anybody.</s> <s>What I say is, you'd better see this little bill put square among you, and then the thing can be kept quiet, do you see?</s> <s>It would be awkward for you to have a regular shindy about it, my man, but that's what it'll come to if I don't get my money."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3068" id="dominics.c0.p3068"><s>This declaration Mr Cripps delivered in a solemn voice which was his nearest approach to earnestness.</s> <s>But he was mistaken in expecting Mr Rastle to be much affected or overawed by it.</s> <s>On the contrary, it gave that gentleman a new insight into his acquaintance's character, which decided him that a prolongation of this interview would neither be pleasant nor profitable.</s> </p>

<p pid="3069" id="dominics.c0.p3069"><s>So Mr Rastle abruptly turned and went, much to the regret of Cripps, who had not half spoken his mind yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="3070" id="dominics.c0.p3070"><s>Returning to the school, the master reported all he had to say, which was not much.</s> <s>There an anxious night was spent by the masters and the one or two boys who were in their confidence in the matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="3071" id="dominics.c0.p3071"><s>The half hope that Loman might return of his own accord before night was quickly dispelled.</s> <s>Bed-time came, and no signs of him.</s> <s>Later his father arrived, anxious and excited, and was closeted for some time with the Doctor.</s> </p>

<p pid="3072" id="dominics.c0.p3072"><s>Meanwhile everything that could be done at that time of night was done.</s> <s>The Maltby newspapers were communicated with, and the police.</s> <s>Unpleasant as it was, the masters decided the right thing to do was to make the matter known at once, and not damage the chance of the boy's discovery by any attempt to keep his disappearance quiet.</s> </p>

<p pid="3073" id="dominics.c0.p3073"><s>At dawn next day an organised search was begun, and inquiries were started in every direction.</s> <s>Mr Cripps, among others, once more received the honour of a visit, this time from Mr Loman himself, who, greatly to the astonishment of the worthy landlord, called for his son's promissory note, which, being produced, he paid without a word.</s> <s>Cripps was fairly taken aback by this unexpected piece of business, and even a trifle disconcerted.</s> <s>It never suited him to be quite square with anybody, and now that Mr Loman had paid every farthing that could be claimed against his son, he did not like the look of Mr Loman at all, and he liked it less before the interview ended.</s> <s>For Mr Loman (who, by the way, was a barrister by profession) put his man that morning through a cross-examination which it wanted all his wits to get over creditably.</s> <s>As it was, he was once or twice driven completely into a corner, and had to acknowledge, for the sake of telling one lie, that the last twenty statements he had made had been lies too.</s> <s>Still Mr Loman kept at him.</s> <s>Now he wanted to know exactly how often his son had visited the Cockchafer?</s> <s>When he was there last?</s> <s>When the time before that?</s> <s>What he had done during his visits?</s> <s>Had he played cards?</s> <s>With whom?</s> <s>With Cripps?</s> <s>Had he lost?</s> <s>Had Cripps won?</s> <s>Had Cripps gone on letting him run up a score and lose money, even though he got no payment?</s> <s>Why had Cripps done so?</s> <s>Where had he expected to get payment from in the end?</s> </p>

<p pid="3074" id="dominics.c0.p3074" type="speech"><s>Altogether it was hot quarters for Cripps that morning, and once or twice he struck completely, and putting himself on his dignity, declared <qs/>"he wasn't a-going to be questioned and brow-beated as if he was a common pickpocket!"<qe/><sls/> which objection Mr Loman quietly silenced by saying <sle/><qs/>"Very well,"<qe/> and turning to go, a movement which so terrified the worthy publican that he caved in at once, and submitted to further questions.</s> </p>

<p pid="3075" id="dominics.c0.p3075"><s>Mr Loman then followed up his advantage by finding out all he could about the companions whom his son had been in the habit of meeting on the occasion of his visits to the Cockchafer.</s> <s>What were their names, occupations, addresses, and so on?</s> <s>Cripps, if any one had told him twenty-four hours ago that he would be meekly divulging all this information to any one in his own house, would have scoffed at the idea.</s> <s>But there was something about Mr Loman's voice, and Mr Loman's eye, and Mr Loman's note-book, which was too much for the publican, and he submitted like a lamb.</s> </p>

<p pid="3076" id="dominics.c0.p3076"><s>In due time the ordeal was over, and Mr Loman said he would now go and call upon these young gentlemen, and see what they had to say, and that Mr Cripps would most likely hear from him again.</s> </p>

<p pid="3077" id="dominics.c0.p3077"><s>Altogether the landlord of the Cockchafer had hardly ever passed such an uncomfortable morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="3078" id="dominics.c0.p3078"><s>Meanwhile the other searchers, among whom were Oliver and Wraysford, were busy.</s> </p>

<p pid="3079" id="dominics.c0.p3079"><s>For a whole day there came no news of the missing boy.</s> <s>No one could be met who had seen him or heard of him.</s> <s>Neither in Maltby nor up the river, nor in the country roads round, could any tidings of him be found.</s> <s>Towards evening those who remained anxiously behind began to entertain fresh fears.</s> <s>Had the boy been merely running away, some one would surely have seen him or heard of him.</s> <s>Had anything worse happened to him?</s> </p>

<p pid="3080" id="dominics.c0.p3080"><s>Mr Loman and the police-inspector paid a hurried visit to the boathouse.</s> <s>Had the boy been there?</s> <s>No, no one had been there for two days.</s> <s>They followed the paths through the woods, asking at every cottage and stopping every passer-by.</s> <s>But no, no one knew anything.</s> <s>No boat had passed through the lock, no passenger on foot had gone past it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3081" id="dominics.c0.p3081"><s>The night came, and with it most of the searchers returned, dejected and worn-out.</s> </p>

<p pid="3097" id="dominics.c0.p3097"><s>The night became more and more stormy.</s> <s>The bleak February wind whistled among the chimneys, and the hard rain beat pitilessly at the windows and on the gravel walk outside.</s> </p>

<p pid="3126" id="dominics.c0.p3126"><s>"Hush!" said Stephen, turning his head to the wind to listen.</s> </p>

<p pid="3127" id="dominics.c0.p3127"><s>What a wind it was!</s> <s>Surely it would beat any voice to shreds!</s> </p>

<p pid="3128" id="dominics.c0.p3128"><s>"We may as well go on," said the boy, impatiently.</s> </p>

<p pid="3129" id="dominics.c0.p3129"><s>"Wait a second or two longer," said Wraysford.</s> </p>

<p pid="3130" id="dominics.c0.p3130"><s>Scarcely had he spoken when, joyous sound! there came on the wind from somewhere what sounded like a feeble shout!</s> </p>

<p pid="3131" id="dominics.c0.p3131"><s>In an instant all four bounded forward and were once more lost in the storm.</s> </p>

<p pid="3132" id="dominics.c0.p3132"><s>But they had hope, and every moment, a night like this, was precious.</s> <s>They groped down the garden walk, and towards the meadow, shouting as they went.</s> <s>Then presently they halted again and listened.</s> </p>

<p pid="3133" id="dominics.c0.p3133"><s>Yes there was the call again, and nearer.</s> <s>Thank Heaven! they were on the right track.</s> <s>On they went once more.</s> <s>Another shout!</s> <s>Nearer still!</s> </p>

<p pid="3134" id="dominics.c0.p3134"><s>Oh, for a lull in the tempest, that they might give one shout back!</s> </p>

<p pid="3135" id="dominics.c0.p3135" type="speech"><s>"Try," said Mr Rastle, <qs/>"they may hear it.</s> <s>Here, Roach, come and shout--one, two, three, and a--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3136" id="dominics.c0.p3136"><s>What a shout it was!</s> <s>The wind got hold of it as if it had been a sparrow's twitter, and tossed it mockingly over their heads and far away behind them, who knows where?</s> <s>"It's no go," said Wraysford.</s> <s>"Hullo, here's the meadow ditch.</s> <s>Hadn't we better follow it up and down?</s> <s>Stephen and I will take the left."</s> </p>

<p pid="3137" id="dominics.c0.p3137"><s>Once more, as they turned, a shout!</s> </p>

<p pid="3138" id="dominics.c0.p3138"><s>"Oh, be quick!" cried Stephen.</s> <s>"Where does it come from?</s> <s>Come, Wray, quick!"</s> </p>

<p pid="3139" id="dominics.c0.p3139"><s>They might as well have tried to fly as run against that wind; but they crawled rapidly forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="3140" id="dominics.c0.p3140"><s>Suddenly, close at their side, rose the shout again.</s> <s>With a bound the two boys were over the ditch, and in another moment a fourfold shout proclaimed that the wanderers were found!</s> </p>

<p pid="3141" id="dominics.c0.p3141"><s>Oliver and Loman were crouching under a tree, the former without coat or waistcoat, which he had thrown round the shivering and now senseless form of his companion.</s> </p>

<p pid="3142" id="dominics.c0.p3142"><s>It was no time for words, either of joy or explanation; time enough for that when every one was safe indoors.</s> <s>Mr Rastle and Roach between them carried Loman, while Oliver, in scarcely better plight, was helped along by his brother and friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="3143" id="dominics.c0.p3143"><s>"Is it far?" he asked, faintly.</s> </p>

<p pid="3144" id="dominics.c0.p3144"><s>"No, old man; that light there is Saint Dominic's."</s> </p>

<p pid="3145" id="dominics.c0.p3145"><s>"Is it?</s> <s>I didn't know that when I shouted; I thought we were miles away."</s> </p>

<p pid="3146" id="dominics.c0.p3146"><s>"Oh, no!</s> <s>Hold up, old boy; we're just there."</s> </p>

<p pid="3147" id="dominics.c0.p3147"><s>And so this strange procession returned before the wind to Saint Dominic's, and when, a few minutes later, watchers and rescuers and rescued all gathered in the Doctor's study, Oliver, as well as Loman, was insensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="3148" id="dominics.c0.p3148"><s>It was some days before the true story of that terrible night could be told, and then Oliver only told it briefly.</s> </p>

<p pid="3149" id="dominics.c0.p3149"><s>Late in the afternoon, as he was about to turn back, he said, he heard from a farmer's boy that he had seen a stranger that morning asleep under a hedge about a mile off.</s> <s>Vague as this information was, it decided Oliver at once to go forward, which he did.</s> <s>As might have been expected, there was no trace of the "stranger" at the hedge, and no amount of searching along it could discover any clue.</s> <s>Still, he did not like to turn back while a chance remained.</s> <s>He went on towards Grandham, inquiring of everybody and looking everywhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="3150" id="dominics.c0.p3150"><s>At last--it was getting dusk--he entered a field across which ran a footpath which led direct to Grandham Green.</s> <s>He was half way across, wondering if he could by any chance find a cart or vehicle of any kind to drive him back to Saint Dominic's, when at the other side of the field he suddenly caught sight of a figure getting up from under the hedge and moving quickly away.</s> <s>He instantly and instinctively gave chase.</s> <s>The other, seeing he was discovered, began to run too.</s> <s>It was Loman.</s> <s>Oliver called to him to stop, but he paid no heed.</s> <s>He continued to run as long as he could, and then, like a hunted animal, turned at bay.</s> </p>

<p pid="3151" id="dominics.c0.p3151"><s>Oliver told very few all that had passed when finally he did come up with the wanderer.</s> <s>His first impression, judging from the unhappy boy's strange and excited manner, was that he had gone out of his mind.</s> <s>He appeared reckless and desperate at first, and determined to resist all attempts to bring him back.</s> <s>He would sooner die than go back to Saint Dominic's, he said.</s> <s>What right had Oliver to interfere with him and dog him in this way?</s> <s>He had a right to go where he chose, and no one should stop him.</s> <s>Oliver let him talk on, not attempting to reply, and avoiding all appearance of using force to detain him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3152" id="dominics.c0.p3152"><s>This wise policy had its effect.</s> <s>In time the poor fellow, who was really suffering more from hunger and fatigue (he had not had a morsel of food since the afternoon before) than from anything else, quieted down, and gave up further resistance.</s> <s>Oliver told him, in as few words as he could, of the distress which his disappearance had caused at Saint Dominic's and to his parents, and besought him to return quietly, promising forgiveness for the past, and undertaking that all would be made right if he would only come home.</s> </p>

<p pid="3153" id="dominics.c0.p3153"><s>Loman listened to all doggedly.</s> <s>"You're humbugging me!" he said.</s> <s>"You know I stole that paper?"</s> </p>

<p pid="3154" id="dominics.c0.p3154"><s>"Oh, don't talk of that!" cried Oliver.</s> <s>"Do come back!"</s> </p>

<p pid="3155" id="dominics.c0.p3155"><s>"You know--can't you get me something to eat?"</s> </p>

<p pid="3156" id="dominics.c0.p3156" type="speech"><s>As he said this he sunk down with a groan upon the grass.</s> <s>Oliver started wildly to rush to the nearest cottage.</s> <s>As he did so, however, a doubt crossed his mind, and he said, <qs/>"You'll promise to wait here, will you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3157" id="dominics.c0.p3157"><s>"Oh, yes! be quick."</s> </p>

<p pid="3158" id="dominics.c0.p3158"><s>Oliver flew on the wings of the wind towards the village.</s> <s>There was a cottage a few hundred yards away.</s> <s>As he neared it, he cast one look back.</s> <s>The wretched boy was on his feet, hurrying away in an opposite direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="3159" id="dominics.c0.p3159"><s>Another chase ensued, though only a short one.</s> <s>For Loman was in no condition to hold out long.</s> <s>Oliver half led, half dragged him to Grandham, where at last he procured food, which the unhappy fugitive devoured ravenously.</s> <s>Then followed another talk, far more satisfactory than the last.</s> <s>Restored once more in body and mind, Loman consented without further demur to accompany Oliver back to Saint Dominic's, but not before he had unburdened his mind of all that was on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3160" id="dominics.c0.p3160"><s>Oliver implored him not to do it now, to wait till he got back, and then to tell all to his father, not to him.</s> <s>But the poor penitent was not to be put off.</s> <s>Until he had confessed all he would not stir a foot back to the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="3161" id="dominics.c0.p3161"><s>Then Oliver heard all that sad story with which the reader is now familiar.</s> <s>How that first act of fraud about the rod had been the beginning of all this misery.</s> <s>How Cripps had used his advantage to drive the boy from one wickedness and folly to another--from deceit to gambling, from gambling to debt, from debt to more deceit, and so on.</s> <s>How drinking, low company, and vicious habits had followed.</s> <s>How all the while he was trying to keep up appearances at the school, though he saw that he was gradually becoming an object of dislike to his fellows.</s> <s>How he had staked everything--his whole hope of getting free from Cripps--on the result of the Nightingale examination; and how, when the critical moment came, he yielded to the tempter and stole the paper.</s> </p>

<p pid="3162" id="dominics.c0.p3162"><s>"And you can fancy how punished I was when, after all, the Doctor missed the paper and altered the questions, Greenfield.</s> <s>I was so taken aback that I didn't even answer as well as I could.</s> <s>And then I lost the paper I had stolen--couldn't find it anywhere, and for weeks I was in constant terror lest it should turn up.</s> <s>Then I saw the fellows were all suspecting you to be the thief, and you know how meanly I took advantage of that to hide my own guilt.</s> <s>Oh, Greenfield, what a wretch, what a miserable wretch I have been!"</s> </p>

<p pid="3163" id="dominics.c0.p3163"><s>"Poor fellow!" said Oliver, with true sympathy.</s> <s>"But, I say, do let's be going back, it's getting late, and looks as if it might rain."</s> </p>

<p pid="3164" id="dominics.c0.p3164"><s>"I _must_ tell you the rest, Greenfield, please.</s> <s>You're the only fellow I can tell it to.</s> <s>Somehow I think if I'd had a friend like you all the last year I shouldn't have gone wrong as I have.</s> <s>How I used to envy you and Wraysford, always together, and telling one another your troubles!</s> <s>Well, of course, after the Nightingale exam, things were worse than ever.</s> <s>I'd given Cripps a bill, you know, a promise to pay in September.</s> <s>I don't know anything about bills, but he made me sign it.</s> <s>Of course I couldn't pay when it came due, and had to make all sorts of excuses and tell all sorts of lies to get him to give me more time; as if I was more likely to pay later on than then!</s> <s>But, somehow, if I could only get the thing off my mind for the present, I felt that was all I cared about.</s> <s>He gave in at last, and I was able to pay it off bit by bit.</s> <s>But I was in constant terror all that term of his coming up to Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>You know he did come once, at the football match against Landfield, and I thought I was done for."</s> </p>

<p pid="3165" id="dominics.c0.p3165"><s>Here Loman paused a moment, and Oliver, seeing that he was determined to tell his story to the end, waited patiently till he continued.</s> </p>

<p pid="3166" id="dominics.c0.p3166"><s>"Then there was that Waterston exam.</s> <s>I fancied I might get that if I worked.</s> <s>Ass that I was to think, after all my wasted time and sin, I had any chance against you or Wraysford!</s> <s>I tried to work, but soon gave it up, and went on going down to the Cockchafer instead, to keep Cripps in good humour, till I was quite a regular there.</s> <s>You know what a fearful hash I made of the exam.</s> <s>I could answer nothing.</s> <s>That very day Cripps had sent up to threaten to tell the Doctor everything unless I paid what I still owed.</s> <s>I had paid off all the bill but eight pounds.</s> <s>I had got some of it from home, and some of it by gambling; I'd paid off all but eight pounds.</s> <s>You know, Greenfield, who lent me that."</s> </p>

<p pid="3167" id="dominics.c0.p3167"><s>"I'm thankful we were able to do it," said Oliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="3168" id="dominics.c0.p3168"><s>"If you'd known how I hated you and despised myself over that eight pounds you would hardly have been glad.</s> <s>Everything was hateful.</s> <s>I took the money down to Cripps and paid it him.</s> <s>He pretended at first that he wouldn't take it; and then when he did, and I asked him to give me back my promissory note, he laughed at me.</s> <s>I nearly went mad, Greenfield, at the thought of not being clear after all.</s> <s>At length he did make believe to give in, and produced what I thought was the bill, and tore it up in my presence.</s> <s>I couldn't see it, but he read it out aloud, and I had no doubt it was actually the thing.</s> <s>I was so grateful I actually felt happy.</s> <s>But then came the discovery of that miserable exam paper.</s> <s>I must have left it in my Juvenal last September, and forgotten all about it.</s> <s>I was certain the Doctor knew quite well I was the thief, but I denied it and tried feebly to put it on you.</s> <s>Then everybody cut me; but I hoped still all might blow over in time.</s> <s>But every day it became harder to bear; I should have had to confess at last, I believe.</s> <s>Then came Cripps's final villainy.</s> <s>He had never destroyed my bill after all, but now calmly claimed the whole amount."</s> </p>

<p pid="3169" id="dominics.c0.p3169"><s>"The scoundrel!" exclaimed Oliver, indignantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="3170" id="dominics.c0.p3170"><s>"I had no receipts to show what I had paid, and of course was at his mercy.</s> <s>This last move really drove me half crazy.</s> <s>I daren't tell any one about it.</s> <s>I was too desperate to think of anything but running away and hiding somewhere.</s> <s>I had no money.</s> <s>I came to you with a lie to try to borrow a pound, so that I might go somewhere by train.</s> <s>You couldn't do it, and so I had to walk, and--and--oh!</s> <s>Greenfield, what shall I do? what will become of me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="3171" id="dominics.c0.p3171" type="speech"><s>"My dear fellow," said Oliver, laying his hand on the unhappy boy's arm, <qs/>"we'll go back together, and I can promise you you'll find nothing but kindness and forgiveness when you get back.</s> <s>If I wasn't sure of that, I wouldn't urge you to come.</s> <s>There!</s> <s>I wish you could have seen your poor father's face last night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3172" id="dominics.c0.p3172"><s>Loman held out no longer; and, indeed, it was high time to think of moving, for the afternoon was closing in and rain was already beginning to fall.</s> </p>

<p pid="3173" id="dominics.c0.p3173"><s>Loman was in no condition for walking, nor, indeed, was Oliver, who had been on his feet since early morning.</s> <s>A farmer's cart was with some difficulty found, which happened to be going a good part of the distance, and in this the two boys late that afternoon ensconced themselves.</s> <s>They talked little at first, and presently not at all.</s> <s>Each had his own thoughts, and they were serious enough to occupy them for a much longer journey.</s> </p>

<p pid="3174" id="dominics.c0.p3174"><s>Night fell presently, soon after they had started, and with it the rain and wind came heavily.</s> <s>There was little enough protection for these two worn-out ones in an empty open cart, but what they could get from an old wrap and some boards they secured.</s> </p>

<p pid="3175" id="dominics.c0.p3175"><s>As the storm grew worse this poor shelter became quite useless, and the two boys suffered all the horrors of a bitter exposure.</s> </p>

<p pid="3176" id="dominics.c0.p3176"><s>Loman, who had got a cough already, was the first to show distress, and he soon became so cold and numbed that Oliver grew alarmed.</s> <s>They would be better walking than sitting still in that jolting cart a night like this.</s> </p>

<p pid="3177" id="dominics.c0.p3177" type="speech"><s>So, much against their own inclination and the advice of the carman, who characterised the proceedings as <qs/>"tomfoolery,"<qe/> they alighted, and attempted to take the short cut across the fields to Saint Dominic's.</s> </p>

<p pid="3178" id="dominics.c0.p3178"><s>Short cut, indeed!</s> <s>It was indeed a sarcastic name for the road those two boys took that terrible night.</s> <s>Oliver could never recollect all that happened those few hours.</s> <s>He was conscious of the tremendous storm, of the hopeless losing of their way, and of Loman's relapse into a state of half-unconsciousness, in the midst of which he constantly begged to be allowed to lie down and sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="3179" id="dominics.c0.p3179"><s>To prevent this was Oliver's principal occupation during that fearful time.</s> <s>More than once he was forced into a hand-to-hand struggle to keep his companion from his purpose.</s> <s>To let him lie down and sleep on such a night would be, he knew, to leave him to certain death.</s> <s>At any cost he must be kept moving.</s> <s>At last the storm fairly vanquished them.</s> <s>Even Oliver began to grow half-hearted in his determination.</s> <s>He took off his own coat and waistcoat and pat them on his comrade, who by this time was stupid with cold and exhaustion.</s> <s>A few minutes longer and both might have given themselves up, when suddenly there flickered a light before them.</s> <s>All Oliver could do was to shout.</s> <s>He had no power left to drag Loman farther, and leave him he would not.</s> <s>He shouted, and the reader knows who heard that shout, and what the answer was.</s> </p>

<p pid="3180" id="dominics.c0.p3180" type="speech"><s>Such was Oliver's story, and it needed little amplification.</s> <s>If it had, the only boy who could have added to it was in no position to do so.</s> <s>For four weeks after that night Loman lay ill with rheumatic fever, so ill that more than once those who watched him despaired of his recovery.</s> <s>But he did recover, and left Saint Dominic's a convalescent, and, better still, truly penitent, looking away from self and his own poor efforts to Him, the World's Great Burden Bearer, whose blood <qs/>"cleanseth us from all sin."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3181" id="dominics.c0.p3181"><s>His schoolfellows saw him no more; did not know, indeed, when he left them.</s> <s>Only one of them shook hands with him at the door of the old school as he went.</s> <s>That boy was Oliver Greenfield.</s> </p>

<p pid="3184" id="dominics.c0.p3184" type="speech"><s>Saint Dominic's flourishes still, and only last season beat the County by five wickets!</s> <s>The captain on that occasion was a fellow called Stephen Greenfield, who carried his bat for forty-eight in the first innings.</s> <s>He is a big fellow, is the captain, and has got a moustache.</s> <s>Though he is the oldest boy at Saint Dominic's, every one talks of him as <qs/>"Greenfield junior."<qe/></s> <s>He is vastly popular, and fellows say there never was such a good Sixth at the school since the days of his brother, Greenfield senior, five years ago.</s> <s>The captain is an object of special awe among the youngsters of the Fourth Junior, who positively quake in their shoes whenever his manly form appears in the upper corridor.</s> </p>

<p pid="3185" id="dominics.c0.p3185"><s>These youngsters, by the way, are still the liveliest section of Saint Dominic's.</s> <s>The names Guinea-pig and Tadpole have died out, and left behind them only the Buttercups and Daisies, who, however, are as fierce rivals and as inky scamps as even their predecessors were.</s> <s>There is a lout of a fellow in the Fourth Senior called Bramble, who is extremely "down" on these juveniles, always snubbing them, and, along with one Padger, a friend of his, plotting to get them into trouble.</s> <s>But somehow they are not much afraid of Bramble, whereat Bramble is particularly furious, and summons Padger to a "meeting" about once a week in his study, there to take counsel against these irreverent Buttercups and Daisies.</s> </p>

<p pid="3186" id="dominics.c0.p3186"><s>About the only other fellow the reader will recollect is Paul, now in the Sixth, a steady-going sort of fellow, who, by the way, has just won the Nightingale Scholarship, greatly to the delight of his particular friend the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="3187" id="dominics.c0.p3187"><s>Last year the Fifth tried to revive an old institution of their Form, in the shape of a newspaper entitled the _Dominican_, directed chiefly against the members of the Sixth.</s> <s>But somehow the undertaking did not come off.</s> <s>The _Dominican_ was a very mild affair for one thing, and there was nothing amusing about it for another thing, and there was a good deal offensive about it for another thing; and for another thing, the captain ordered it to be taken down off the wall on the first day of its appearance, and announced that if he had any more of this nonsense he would thrash one or two whose names he mentioned, and knock one or two others out of the first eleven.</s> </p>

<p pid="3188" id="dominics.c0.p3188"><s>The _Dominican_ has not appeared since.</s> </p>

<p pid="3189" id="dominics.c0.p3189" type="speech"><s>The big cricket match against the County I spoke of just now was a famous event for more reasons than one.</s> <s>The chief reason, of course, was the glorious victory of the old school; but another reason, almost as notable, was the strange muster of old boys who turned up to witness the exploits of the <qs/>"youngsters."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3190" id="dominics.c0.p3190"><s>There was Tom Braddy, for instance, smoking a big cigar the size of a pencil-case, looking the picture of a snob.</s> <s>And with him a vacant-looking young man with a great crop of whiskers on his puffy cheeks.</s> <s>His name was Simon.</s> <s>The great idea of these two worthies seemed to be to do the grand before their posterity.</s> <s>They were convinced in their own minds that in this they were completely successful, but no one else saw it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3191" id="dominics.c0.p3191"><s>Boys took a good deal more interest in a lame gentleman present, who was cracking jokes with everybody, and hobbling about from one old crony to another in a manner that was perfectly frisky.</s> <s>Every one seemed to like Mr Pembury, and not a _few_ to be afraid of him.</s> <s>Perhaps that was because he was the editor of a well-known paper of the day, and every one likes to be on good terms with an editor.</s> </p>

<p pid="3192" id="dominics.c0.p3192" type="speech"><s>Then there were a batch of fellows whose names we need hardly enumerate, who had run over from Oxford, or Cambridge, or London for the day, and who got into clusters between the innings and talked and laughed a great deal over old times, when <qs/>"Bully did this,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Rick did that,"<qe/> and so on.</s> <s>A nice lot of fellows they looked on the whole, and one or two, so people said, were doing well.</s> </p>

<p pid="3193" id="dominics.c0.p3193"><s>But among these _the_ lions of the day were two friends who strolled about arm-in-arm, and appeared far more at home in Saint Dominic's even than the boys themselves.</s> <s>One of them was the big brother of the captain--a terrible fellow by all accounts.</s> <s>He rowed in the boat of his 'Varsity the last year he was at Cambridge, and since then he has been called to the bar, and no one knows what else!</s> <s>People say Oliver Greenfield is a rising man; if so, we may hear of him again.</s> <s>At any rate in the eyes of the admiring youngsters of Saint Dominic's he was a great man already.</s> </p>
