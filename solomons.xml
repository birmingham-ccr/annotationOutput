<p pid="6" id="solomons.c0.p6"><s sid="6" id="solomons.c0.s6">The author ventures to take this opportunity to thank his readers for the kind reception they have accorded to the successive editions of this tale during the last twelve years.</s> <s sid="7" id="solomons.c0.s7">He hopes that in its present form it will fall into the hands of an even wider public, and that in years to come it may continue to afford amusement to those who are still young enough at heart to love a story of treasure, war, and wild adventure.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="solomons.c0.p9"><s sid="10" id="solomons.c0.s10">Now, in 1907, on the occasion of the issue of this edition, I can only add how glad I am that my romance should continue to please so many readers.</s> <s sid="11" id="solomons.c0.s11">Imagination has been verified by fact; the King Solomon's Mines I dreamed of have been discovered, and are putting out their gold once more, and, according to the latest reports, their diamonds also; the Kukuanas or, rather, the Matabele, have been tamed by the white man's bullets, but still there seem to be many who find pleasure in these simple pages.</s> <s sid="12" id="solomons.c0.s12">That they may continue so to do, even to the third and fourth generation, or perhaps longer still, would, I am sure, be the hope of our old and departed friend, Allan Quatermain.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="solomons.c0.p12" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="solomons.c0.s16">Now that this book is printed, and about to be given to the world, a sense of its shortcomings both in style and contents, weighs very heavily upon me.</s> <s sid="17" id="solomons.c0.s17">As regards the latter, I can only say that it does not pretend to be a full account of everything we did and saw.</s> <s sid="18" id="solomons.c0.s18">There are many things connected with our journey into Kukuanaland that I should have liked to dwell upon at length, which, as it is, have been scarcely alluded to.</s> <s sid="19" id="solomons.c0.s19">Amongst these are the curious legends which I collected about the chain armour that saved us from destruction in the great battle of Loo, and also about the "Silent Ones" or Colossi at the mouth of the stalactite cave.</s> <s sid="20" id="solomons.c0.s20">Again, if I had given way to my own impulses, I should have wished to go into the differences, some of which are to my mind very suggestive, between the Zulu and Kukuana dialects.</s> <s sid="21" id="solomons.c0.s21">Also a few pages might have been given up profitably to the consideration of the indigenous flora and fauna of Kukuanaland.[1] Then there remains the most interesting subject--that, as it is, has only been touched on incidentally--of the magnificent system of military organisation in force in that country, which, in my opinion, is much superior to that inaugurated by Chaka in Zululand, inasmuch as it permits of even more rapid mobilisation, and does not necessitate the employment of the pernicious system of enforced celibacy.</s> <s sid="22" id="solomons.c0.s22">Lastly, I have scarcely spoken of the domestic and family customs of the Kukuanas, many of which are exceedingly quaint, or of their proficiency in the art of smelting and welding metals.</s> <s sid="23" id="solomons.c0.s23">This science they carry to considerable perfection, of which a good example is to be seen in their <qs/>"tollas,"<qe/> or heavy throwing knives, the backs of these weapons being made of hammered iron, and the edges of beautiful steel welded with great skill on to the iron frames.</s> <s sid="24" id="solomons.c0.s24">The fact of the matter is, I thought, with Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, that the best plan would be to tell my story in a plain, straightforward manner, and to leave these matters to be dealt with subsequently in whatever way ultimately may appear to be desirable.</s> <s sid="25" id="solomons.c0.s25">In the meanwhile I shall, of course, be delighted to give all information in my power to anybody interested in such things.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="solomons.c0.p13" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="solomons.c0.s26">And now it only remains for me to offer apologies for my blunt way of writing.</s> <s sid="27" id="solomons.c0.s27">I can but say in excuse of it that I am more accustomed to handle a rifle than a pen, and cannot make any pretence to the grand literary flights and flourishes which I see in novels--for sometimes I like to read a novel.</s> <s sid="28" id="solomons.c0.s28">I suppose they--the flights and flourishes--are desirable, and I regret not being able to supply them; but at the same time I cannot help thinking that simple things are always the most impressive, and that books are easier to understand when they are written in plain language, though perhaps I have no right to set up an opinion on such a matter.</s> <s sid="29" id="solomons.c0.s29"><qs/>"A sharp spear,"<qe/> runs the Kukuana saying, "needs no polish"; and on the same principle I venture to hope that a true story, however strange it may be, does not require to be decked out in fine words.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="solomons.c1.p2"><s sid="12" id="solomons.c1.s12">First reason:</s> <s sid="13" id="solomons.c1.s13">Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked me.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="solomons.c1.p3"><s sid="14" id="solomons.c1.s14">Second reason:</s> <s sid="15" id="solomons.c1.s15">Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain in my left leg.</s> <s sid="16" id="solomons.c1.s16">Ever since that confounded lion got hold of me I have been liable to this trouble, and being rather bad just now, it makes me limp more than ever.</s> <s sid="17" id="solomons.c1.s17">There must be some poison in a lion's teeth, otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again, generally, mark you, at the same time of year that you got your mauling?</s> <s sid="18" id="solomons.c1.s18">It is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions or more, as I have in the course of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco.</s> <s sid="19" id="solomons.c1.s19">It breaks the routine of the thing, and putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man and don't like that.</s> <s sid="20" id="solomons.c1.s20">This is by the way.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="solomons.c1.p4"><s sid="21" id="solomons.c1.s21">Third reason:</s> <s sid="22" id="solomons.c1.s22">Because I want my boy Harry, who is over there at the hospital in London studying to become a doctor, to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so.</s> <s sid="23" id="solomons.c1.s23">Hospital work must sometimes pall and grow rather dull, for even of cutting up dead bodies there may come satiety, and as this history will not be dull, whatever else it may be, it will put a little life into things for a day or two while Harry is reading of our adventures.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="solomons.c1.p5"><s sid="24" id="solomons.c1.s24">Fourth reason and last:</s> <s sid="25" id="solomons.c1.s25">Because I am going to tell the strangest story that I remember.</s> <s sid="26" id="solomons.c1.s26">It may seem a queer thing to say, especially considering that there is no woman in it--except Foulata.</s> <s sid="27" id="solomons.c1.s27">Stop, though! there is Gagaoola, if she was a woman, and not a fiend.</s> <s sid="28" id="solomons.c1.s28">But she was a hundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don't count her.</s> <s sid="29" id="solomons.c1.s29">At any rate, I can safely say that there is not a _petticoat_ in the whole history.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="solomons.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="solomons.c1.s30">Well, I had better come to the yoke.</s> <s sid="31" id="solomons.c1.s31">It is a stiff place, and I feel as though I were bogged up to the axle.</s> <s sid="32" id="solomons.c1.s32">But, <qs/>"_sutjes, sutjes_,"<qe/> as the Boers say--I am sure I don't know how they spell it--softly does it.</s> <s sid="33" id="solomons.c1.s33">A strong team will come through at last, that is, if they are not too poor.</s> <s sid="34" id="solomons.c1.s34">You can never do anything with poor oxen.</s> <s sid="35" id="solomons.c1.s35">Now to make a start.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="solomons.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="solomons.c1.s36">I, Allan Quatermain, of Durban, Natal, Gentleman, make oath and say--That's how I headed my deposition before the magistrate about poor Khiva's and Ventvogel's sad deaths; but somehow it doesn't seem quite the right way to begin a book.</s> <s sid="37" id="solomons.c1.s37">And, besides, am I a gentleman?</s> <s sid="38" id="solomons.c1.s38">What is a gentleman?</s> <s sid="39" id="solomons.c1.s39">I don't quite know, and yet I have had to do with niggers--no, I will scratch out that word <qs/>"niggers,"<qe/> for I do not like it.</s> <s sid="40" id="solomons.c1.s40">I've known natives who _are_, and so you will say, Harry, my boy, before you have done with this tale, and I have known mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home, too, who _are not_.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="solomons.c1.p8"><s sid="41" id="solomons.c1.s41">At any rate, I was born a gentleman, though I have been nothing but a poor travelling trader and hunter all my life.</s> <s sid="42" id="solomons.c1.s42">Whether I have remained so I known not, you must judge of that.</s> <s sid="43" id="solomons.c1.s43">Heaven knows I've tried.</s> <s sid="44" id="solomons.c1.s44">I have killed many men in my time, yet I have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent blood, but only in self-defence.</s> <s sid="45" id="solomons.c1.s45">The Almighty gave us our lives, and I suppose He meant us to defend them, at least I have always acted on that, and I hope it will not be brought up against me when my clock strikes.</s> <s sid="46" id="solomons.c1.s46">There, there, it is a cruel and a wicked world, and for a timid man I have been mixed up in a great deal of fighting.</s> <s sid="47" id="solomons.c1.s47">I cannot tell the rights of it, but at any rate I have never stolen, though once I cheated a Kafir out of a herd of cattle.</s> <s sid="48" id="solomons.c1.s48">But then he had done me a dirty turn, and it has troubled me ever since into the bargain.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="solomons.c1.p9"><s sid="49" id="solomons.c1.s49">Well, it is eighteen months or so ago since first I met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good.</s> <s sid="50" id="solomons.c1.s50">It was in this way.</s> <s sid="51" id="solomons.c1.s51">I had been up elephant hunting beyond Bamangwato, and had met with bad luck.</s> <s sid="52" id="solomons.c1.s52">Everything went wrong that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly.</s> <s sid="53" id="solomons.c1.s53">So soon as I was well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory as I had, together with my wagon and oxen, discharged my hunters, and took the post-cart to the Cape.</s> <s sid="54" id="solomons.c1.s54">After spending a week in Cape Town, finding that they overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen everything there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country, and the new Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do nothing of the sort, I determined to go back to Natal by the _Dunkeld_, then lying at the docks waiting for the _Edinburgh Castle_ due in from England.</s> <s sid="55" id="solomons.c1.s55">I took my berth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the _Edinburgh Castle_ transhipped, and we weighed and put to sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="solomons.c1.p10"><s sid="56" id="solomons.c1.s56">Among these passengers who came on board were two who excited my curiosity.</s> <s sid="57" id="solomons.c1.s57">One, a gentleman of about thirty, was perhaps the biggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw.</s> <s sid="58" id="solomons.c1.s58">He had yellow hair, a thick yellow beard, clear-cut features, and large grey eyes set deep in his head.</s> <s sid="59" id="solomons.c1.s59">I never saw a finer-looking man, and somehow he reminded me of an ancient Dane.</s> <s sid="60" id="solomons.c1.s60">Not that I know much of ancient Danes, though I knew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds; but I remember once seeing a picture of some of those gentry, who, I take it, were a kind of white Zulus.</s> <s sid="61" id="solomons.c1.s61">They were drinking out of big horns, and their long hair hung down their backs.</s> <s sid="62" id="solomons.c1.s62">As I looked at my friend standing there by the companion-ladder, I thought that if he only let his grow a little, put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders, and took hold of a battle-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that picture.</s> <s sid="63" id="solomons.c1.s63">And by the way it is a curious thing, and just shows how the blood will out, I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that was the big man's name, is of Danish blood.[1] He also reminded me strongly of somebody else, but at the time I could not remember who it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="solomons.c1.p11"><s sid="64" id="solomons.c1.s64">The other man, who stood talking to Sir Henry, was stout and dark, and of quite a different cut.</s> <s sid="65" id="solomons.c1.s65">I suspected at once that he was a naval officer; I don't know why, but it is difficult to mistake a navy man.</s> <s sid="66" id="solomons.c1.s66">I have gone shooting trips with several of them in the course of my life, and they have always proved themselves the best and bravest and nicest fellows I ever met, though sadly given, some of them, to the use of profane language.</s> <s sid="67" id="solomons.c1.s67">I asked a page or two back, what is a gentleman?</s> <s sid="68" id="solomons.c1.s68">I'll answer the question now:</s> <s sid="69" id="solomons.c1.s69">A Royal Naval officer is, in a general sort of way, though of course there may be a black sheep among them here and there.</s> <s sid="70" id="solomons.c1.s70">I fancy it is just the wide seas and the breath of God's winds that wash their hearts and blow the bitterness out of their minds and make them what men ought to be.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="solomons.c1.p12"><s sid="71" id="solomons.c1.s71">Well, to return, I proved right again; I ascertained that the dark man _was_ a naval officer, a lieutenant of thirty-one, who, after seventeen years' service, had been turned out of her Majesty's employ with the barren honour of a commander's rank, because it was impossible that he should be promoted.</s> <s sid="72" id="solomons.c1.s72">This is what people who serve the Queen have to expect: to be shot out into the cold world to find a living just when they are beginning really to understand their work, and to reach the prime of life.</s> <s sid="73" id="solomons.c1.s73">I suppose they don't mind it, but for my own part I had rather earn my bread as a hunter.</s> <s sid="74" id="solomons.c1.s74">One's halfpence are as scarce perhaps, but you do not get so many kicks.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="solomons.c1.p13"><s sid="75" id="solomons.c1.s75">The officer's name I found out--by referring to the passengers' lists--was Good--Captain John Good.</s> <s sid="76" id="solomons.c1.s76">He was broad, of medium height, dark, stout, and rather a curious man to look at.</s> <s sid="77" id="solomons.c1.s77">He was so very neat and so very clean-shaved, and he always wore an eye-glass in his right eye.</s> <s sid="78" id="solomons.c1.s78">It seemed to grow there, for it had no string, and he never took it out except to wipe it.</s> <s sid="79" id="solomons.c1.s79">At first I thought he used to sleep in it, but afterwards I found that this was a mistake.</s> <s sid="80" id="solomons.c1.s80">He put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed, together with his false teeth, of which he had two beautiful sets that, my own being none of the best, have often caused me to break the tenth commandment.</s> <s sid="81" id="solomons.c1.s81">But I am anticipating.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="solomons.c1.p14"><s sid="82" id="solomons.c1.s82">Soon after we had got under way evening closed in, and brought with it very dirty weather.</s> <s sid="83" id="solomons.c1.s83">A keen breeze sprung up off land, and a kind of aggravated Scotch mist soon drove everybody from the deck.</s> <s sid="84" id="solomons.c1.s84">As for the _Dunkeld_, she is a flat-bottomed punt, and going up light as she was, she rolled very heavily.</s> <s sid="85" id="solomons.c1.s85">It almost seemed as though she would go right over, but she never did.</s> <s sid="86" id="solomons.c1.s86">It was quite impossible to walk about, so I stood near the engines where it was warm, and amused myself with watching the pendulum, which was fixed opposite to me, swinging slowly backwards and forwards as the vessel rolled, and marking the angle she touched at each lurch.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="solomons.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="solomons.c1.s87"><qs/>"That pendulum's wrong; it is not properly weighted,"<qe/> suddenly said a somewhat testy voice at my shoulder.</s> <s sid="88" id="solomons.c1.s88">Looking round I saw the naval officer whom I had noticed when the passengers came aboard.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="solomons.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="solomons.c1.s89"><qs/>"Indeed, now what makes you think so?"<qe/></s> <s sid="90" id="solomons.c1.s90">I asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="solomons.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="solomons.c1.s91"><qs/>"Think so.</s> <s sid="92" id="solomons.c1.s92">I don't think at all.</s> <s sid="93" id="solomons.c1.s93">Why there"<qe/><sls/>--as she righted herself after a roll--<sle/><qs/>"if the ship had really rolled to the degree that thing pointed to, then she would never have rolled again, that's all.</s> <s sid="94" id="solomons.c1.s94">But it is just like these merchant skippers, they are always so confoundedly careless."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="solomons.c1.p18"><s sid="95" id="solomons.c1.s95">Just then the dinner-bell rang, and I was not sorry, for it is a dreadful thing to have to listen to an officer of the Royal Navy when he gets on to that subject.</s> <s sid="96" id="solomons.c1.s96">I only know one worse thing, and that is to hear a merchant skipper express his candid opinion of officers of the Royal Navy.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="solomons.c1.p19"><s sid="97" id="solomons.c1.s97">Captain Good and I went down to dinner together, and there we found Sir Henry Curtis already seated.</s> <s sid="98" id="solomons.c1.s98">He and Captain Good were placed together, and I sat opposite to them.</s> <s sid="99" id="solomons.c1.s99">The captain and I soon fell into talk about shooting and what not; he asking me many questions, for he is very inquisitive about all sorts of things, and I answering them as well as I could.</s> <s sid="100" id="solomons.c1.s100">Presently he got on to elephants.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="solomons.c3.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="solomons.c3.s1">It takes from four to five days, according to the speed of the vessel and the state of the weather, to run up from the Cape to Durban.</s> <s sid="2" id="solomons.c3.s2">Sometimes, if the landing is bad at East London, where they have not yet made that wonderful harbour they talk so much of, and sink such a mint of money in, a ship is delayed for twenty-four hours before the cargo boats can get out to take off the goods.</s> <s sid="3" id="solomons.c3.s3">But on this occasion we had not to wait at all, for there were no breakers on the Bar to speak of, and the tugs came out at once with the long strings of ugly flat-bottomed boats behind them, into which the packages were bundled with a crash.</s> <s sid="4" id="solomons.c3.s4">It did not matter what they might be, over they went slap-bang; whether they contained china or woollen goods they met with the same treatment.</s> <s sid="5" id="solomons.c3.s5">I saw one case holding four dozen of champagne smashed all to bits, and there was the champagne fizzing and boiling about in the bottom of the dirty cargo boat.</s> <s sid="6" id="solomons.c3.s6">It was a wicked waste, and evidently so the Kafirs in the boat thought, for they found a couple of unbroken bottles, and knocking off the necks drank the contents.</s> <s sid="7" id="solomons.c3.s7">But they had not allowed for the expansion caused by the fizz in the wine, and, feeling themselves swelling, rolled about in the bottom of the boat, calling out that the good liquor was <qs/>"tagati"<qe/>--that is, bewitched.</s> <s sid="8" id="solomons.c3.s8">I spoke to them from the vessel, and told them it was the white man's strongest medicine, and that they were as good as dead men.</s> <s sid="9" id="solomons.c3.s9">Those Kafirs went to the shore in a very great fright, and I do not think that they will touch champagne again.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="solomons.c3.p2"><s sid="10" id="solomons.c3.s10">Well, all the time that we were steaming up to Natal I was thinking over Sir Henry Curtis's offer.</s> <s sid="11" id="solomons.c3.s11">We did not speak any more on the subject for a day or two, though I told them many hunting yarns, all true ones.</s> <s sid="12" id="solomons.c3.s12">There is no need to tell lies about hunting, for so many curious things happen within the knowledge of a man whose business it is to hunt; but this is by the way.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="solomons.c3.p3"><s sid="13" id="solomons.c3.s13">At last, one beautiful evening in January, which is our hottest month, we steamed past the coast of Natal, expecting to make Durban Point by sunset.</s> <s sid="14" id="solomons.c3.s14">It is a lovely coast all along from East London, with its red sandhills and wide sweeps of vivid green, dotted here and there with Kafir kraals, and bordered by a ribbon of white surf, which spouts up in pillars of foam where it hits the rocks.</s> <s sid="15" id="solomons.c3.s15">But just before you come to Durban there is a peculiar richness about the landscape.</s> <s sid="16" id="solomons.c3.s16">There are the sheer kloofs cut in the hills by the rushing rains of centuries, down which the rivers sparkle; there is the deepest green of the bush, growing as God planted it, and the other greens of the mealie gardens and the sugar patches, while now and again a white house, smiling out at the placid sea, puts a finish and gives an air of homeliness to the scene.</s> <s sid="17" id="solomons.c3.s17">For to my mind, however beautiful a view may be, it requires the presence of man to make it complete, but perhaps that is because I have lived so much in the wilderness, and therefore know the value of civilisation, though to be sure it drives away the game.</s> <s sid="18" id="solomons.c3.s18">The Garden of Eden, no doubt, looked fair before man was, but I always think that it must have been fairer when Eve adorned it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="solomons.c3.p4"><s sid="19" id="solomons.c3.s19">To return, we had miscalculated a little, and the sun was well down before we dropped anchor off the Point, and heard the gun which told the good folks of Durban that the English Mail was in.</s> <s sid="20" id="solomons.c3.s20">It was too late to think of getting over the Bar that night, so we went comfortably to dinner, after seeing the Mails carried off in the life-boat.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="solomons.c3.p5"><s sid="21" id="solomons.c3.s21">When we came up again the moon was out, and shining so brightly over sea and shore that she almost paled the quick, large flashes from the lighthouse.</s> <s sid="22" id="solomons.c3.s22">From the shore floated sweet spicy odours that always remind me of hymns and missionaries, and in the windows of the houses on the Berea sparkled a hundred lights.</s> <s sid="23" id="solomons.c3.s23">From a large brig lying near also came the music of the sailors as they worked at getting the anchor up in order to be ready for the wind.</s> <s sid="24" id="solomons.c3.s24">Altogether it was a perfect night, such a night as you sometimes get in Southern Africa, and it threw a garment of peace over everybody as the moon threw a garment of silver over everything.</s> <s sid="25" id="solomons.c3.s25">Even the great bulldog, belonging to a sporting passenger, seemed to yield to its gentle influences, and forgetting his yearning to come to close quarters with the baboon in a cage on the foc'sle, snored happily at the door of the cabin, dreaming no doubt that he had finished him, and happy in his dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="solomons.c3.p6"><s sid="26" id="solomons.c3.s26">We three--that is, Sir Henry Curtis, Captain Good, and myself--went and sat by the wheel, and were quiet for a while.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="solomons.c3.p7" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="solomons.c3.s27"><qs/>"Well, Mr. Quatermain,"<qe/><sss/> said Sir Henry presently, <sse/><qs/>"have you been thinking about my proposals?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="solomons.c3.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="solomons.c3.s28"><qs/>"Ay,"<qe/><sss/> echoed Captain Good, <sse/><qs/>"what do you think of them, Mr. Quatermain?</s> <s sid="29" id="solomons.c3.s29">I hope that you are going to give us the pleasure of your company so far as Solomon's Mines, or wherever the gentleman you knew as Neville may have got to."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="solomons.c3.p9"><s sid="30" id="solomons.c3.s30">I rose and knocked out my pipe before I answered.</s> <s sid="31" id="solomons.c3.s31">I had not made up my mind, and wanted an additional moment to decide.</s> <s sid="32" id="solomons.c3.s32">Before the burning tobacco had fallen into the sea I had decided; just that little extra second did the trick.</s> <s sid="33" id="solomons.c3.s33">It is often the way when you have been bothering a long time over a thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="solomons.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="solomons.c3.s34"><qs/>"Yes, gentlemen,"<qe/> I said, sitting down again, "I will go, and by your leave I will tell you why, and on what conditions.</s> <s sid="35" id="solomons.c3.s35">First for the terms which I ask.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="solomons.c3.p18" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="solomons.c3.s57"><qs/>"You may perhaps wonder,"<qe/><sss/> I went on, <sse/><qs/>"why, if I think this, I, who am, as I told you, a timid man, should undertake such a journey.</s> <s sid="58" id="solomons.c3.s58">It is for two reasons.</s> <s sid="59" id="solomons.c3.s59">First I am a fatalist, and believe that my time is appointed to come quite without reference to my own movements and will, and that if I am to go to Suliman's Mountains to be killed, I shall go there and shall be killed.</s> <s sid="60" id="solomons.c3.s60">God Almighty, no doubt, knows His mind about me, so I need not trouble on that point.</s> <s sid="61" id="solomons.c3.s61">Secondly, I am a poor man.</s> <s sid="62" id="solomons.c3.s62">For nearly forty years I have hunted and traded, but I have never made more than a living.</s> <s sid="63" id="solomons.c3.s63">Well, gentlemen, I don't know if you are aware that the average life of an elephant hunter from the time he takes to the trade is between four and five years.</s> <s sid="64" id="solomons.c3.s64">So you see I have lived through about seven generations of my class, and I should think that my time cannot be far off, anyway.</s> <s sid="65" id="solomons.c3.s65">Now, if anything were to happen to me in the ordinary course of business, by the time my debts are paid there would be nothing left to support my son Harry whilst he was getting in the way of earning a living, whereas now he will be set up for five years.</s> <s sid="66" id="solomons.c3.s66">There is the whole affair in a nutshell."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="solomons.c3.p19" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="solomons.c3.s67"><qs/>"Mr. Quatermain,"<qe/><sls/> said Sir Henry, who had been giving me his most serious attention, <sle/><qs/>"your motives for undertaking an enterprise which you believe can only end in disaster reflect a great deal of credit on you.</s> <s sid="68" id="solomons.c3.s68">Whether or not you are right, of course time and the event alone can show.</s> <s sid="69" id="solomons.c3.s69">But whether you are right or wrong, I may as well tell you at once that I am going through with it to the end, sweet or bitter.</s> <s sid="70" id="solomons.c3.s70">If we are to be knocked on the head, all I have to say is, that I hope we get a little shooting first, eh, Good?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="solomons.c3.p20" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="solomons.c3.s71"><qs/>"Yes, yes,"<qe/> put in the captain.</s> <s sid="72" id="solomons.c3.s72"><qs/>"We have all three of us been accustomed to face danger, and to hold our lives in our hands in various ways, so it is no good turning back now.</s> <s sid="73" id="solomons.c3.s73">And now I vote we go down to the saloon and take an observation just for luck, you know."<qe/></s> <s sid="74" id="solomons.c3.s74">And we did--through the bottom of a tumbler.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="solomons.c3.p21"><s sid="75" id="solomons.c3.s75">Next day we went ashore, and I put up Sir Henry and Captain Good at the little shanty I have built on the Berea, and which I call my home.</s> <s sid="76" id="solomons.c3.s76">There are only three rooms and a kitchen in it, and it is constructed of green brick with a galvanised iron roof, but there is a good garden with the best loquot trees in it that I know, and some nice young mangoes, of which I hope great things.</s> <s sid="77" id="solomons.c3.s77">The curator of the botanical gardens gave them to me.</s> <s sid="78" id="solomons.c3.s78">It is looked after by an old hunter of mine named Jack, whose thigh was so badly broken by a buffalo cow in Sikukunis country that he will never hunt again.</s> <s sid="79" id="solomons.c3.s79">But he can potter about and garden, being a Griqua by birth.</s> <s sid="80" id="solomons.c3.s80">You will never persuade a Zulu to take much interest in gardening.</s> <s sid="81" id="solomons.c3.s81">It is a peaceful art, and peaceful arts are not in his line.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="solomons.c3.p22"><s sid="82" id="solomons.c3.s82">Sir Henry and Good slept in a tent pitched in my little grove of orange trees at the end of the garden, for there was no room for them in the house, and what with the smell of the bloom, and the sight of the green and golden fruit--in Durban you will see all three on the tree together--I daresay it is a pleasant place enough, for we have few mosquitos here on the Berea, unless there happens to come an unusually heavy rain.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="solomons.c3.p23"><s sid="83" id="solomons.c3.s83">Well, to get on--for if I do not, Harry, you will be tired of my story before ever we fetch up at Suliman's Mountains--having once made up my mind to go I set about making the necessary preparations.</s> <s sid="84" id="solomons.c3.s84">First I secured the deed from Sir Henry, providing for you, my boy, in case of accidents.</s> <s sid="85" id="solomons.c3.s85">There was some difficulty about its legal execution, as Sir Henry was a stranger here, and the property to be charged is over the water; but it was ultimately got over with the help of a lawyer, who charged PS20 for the job--a price that I thought outrageous.</s> <s sid="86" id="solomons.c3.s86">Then I pocketed my cheque for PS500.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="solomons.c3.p24" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="solomons.c3.s87">Having paid this tribute to my bump of caution, I purchased a wagon and a span of oxen on Sir Henry's behalf, and beauties they were.</s> <s sid="88" id="solomons.c3.s88">It was a twenty-two-foot wagon with iron axles, very strong, very light, and built throughout of stink wood; not quite a new one, having been to the Diamond Fields and back, but, in my opinion, all the better for that, for I could see that the wood was well seasoned.</s> <s sid="89" id="solomons.c3.s89">If anything is going to give in a wagon, or if there is green wood in it, it will show out on the first trip.</s> <s sid="90" id="solomons.c3.s90">This particular vehicle was what we call a "half-tented" wagon, that is to say, only covered in over the after twelve feet, leaving all the front part free for the necessaries we had to carry with us.</s> <s sid="91" id="solomons.c3.s91">In this after part were a hide <qs/>"cartle,"<qe/> or bed, on which two people could sleep, also racks for rifles, and many other little conveniences.</s> <s sid="92" id="solomons.c3.s92">I gave PS125 for it, and think that it was cheap at the price.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="solomons.c3.p25" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="solomons.c3.s93">Then I bought a beautiful team of twenty Zulu oxen, which I had kept my eye on for a year or two.</s> <s sid="94" id="solomons.c3.s94">Sixteen oxen is the usual number for a team, but I took four extra to allow for casualties.</s> <s sid="95" id="solomons.c3.s95">These Zulu cattle are small and light, not more than half the size of the Africander oxen, which are generally used for transport purposes; but they will live where the Africanders would starve, and with a moderate load can make five miles a day better going, being quicker and not so liable to become footsore.</s> <s sid="96" id="solomons.c3.s96">What is more, this lot were thoroughly <qs/>"salted,"<qe/> that is, they had worked all over South Africa, and so had become proof, comparatively speaking, against red water, which so frequently destroys whole teams of oxen when they get on to strange "veldt" or grass country.</s> <s sid="97" id="solomons.c3.s97">As for <qs/>"lung sick,"<qe/> which is a dreadful form of pneumonia, very prevalent in this country, they had all been inoculated against it.</s> <s sid="98" id="solomons.c3.s98">This is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an ox, and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal which has died of the sickness.</s> <s sid="99" id="solomons.c3.s99">The result is that the ox sickens, takes the disease in a mild form, which causes its tail to drop off, as a rule about a foot from the root, and becomes proof against future attacks.</s> <s sid="100" id="solomons.c3.s100">It seems cruel to rob the animal of his tail, especially in a country where there are so many flies, but it is better to sacrifice the tail and keep the ox than to lose both tail and ox, for a tail without an ox is not much good, except to dust with.</s> <s sid="101" id="solomons.c3.s101">Still it does look odd to trek along behind twenty stumps, where there ought to be tails.</s> <s sid="102" id="solomons.c3.s102">It seems as though Nature made a trifling mistake, and stuck the stern ornaments of a lot of prize bull-dogs on to the rumps of the oxen.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="solomons.c3.p26"><s sid="103" id="solomons.c3.s103">Next came the question of provisioning and medicines, one which required the most careful consideration, for what we had to do was to avoid lumbering the wagon, and yet to take everything absolutely necessary.</s> <s sid="104" id="solomons.c3.s104">Fortunately, it turned out that Good is a bit of a doctor, having at some point in his previous career managed to pass through a course of medical and surgical instruction, which he has more or less kept up.</s> <s sid="105" id="solomons.c3.s105">He is not, of course, qualified, but he knows more about it than many a man who can write M.D. after his name, as we found out afterwards, and he had a splendid travelling medicine chest and a set of instruments.</s> <s sid="106" id="solomons.c3.s106">Whilst we were at Durban he cut off a Kafir's big toe in a way which it was a pleasure to see.</s> <s sid="107" id="solomons.c3.s107">But he was quite nonplussed when the Kafir, who had sat stolidly watching the operation, asked him to put on another, saying that a "white one" would do at a pinch.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="solomons.c3.p27"><s sid="108" id="solomons.c3.s108">There remained, when these questions were satisfactorily settled, two further important points for consideration, namely, that of arms and that of servants.</s> <s sid="109" id="solomons.c3.s109">As to the arms I cannot do better than put down a list of those which we finally decided on from among the ample store that Sir Henry had brought with him from England, and those which I owned.</s> <s sid="110" id="solomons.c3.s110">I copy it from my pocket-book, where I made the entry at the time.</s> </p>
