<p pid="1" id="girls.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="girls.c1.s1"><qs/>"Me want to see Hetty,"<qe/> said an imperious baby voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="girls.c1.s2"><qs/>"No, no; not this morning, Miss Nan, dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="girls.c1.s3"><qs/>"Me do want to see Hetty,"<qe/> was the quick, impatient reply.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c1.s4">And a sturdy indignant little face looked up at Nurse, to watch the effect of the last decisive words.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="girls.c1.s5">Finding no affirmative reply on Nurse's placid face, the small lips closed firmly--two dimples came and went on two very round cheeks--the mischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter, and the next moment the little questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door, and was toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hetty's room.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c1.s6">The room door was open, so the truant went in.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c1.s7">A bed with the bedclothes all tossed about, a half worn-out slipper on the floor, a very untidy dressing-table met her eyes, but no Hetty.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="girls.c1.s8"><qs/>"Me want Hetty, me do,"<qe/> piped the treble voice, and then the little feet commenced a careful and watchful pilgrimage, the lips still firmly shut, the dimples coming and going, and the eyes throwing many upward glances in the direction of Nurse and the nursery.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c1.p6"><s sid="9" id="girls.c1.s9">No pursuit as yet, and great, great hope of finding Hetty somewhere in the down-stair regions.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c1.s10">Ah, now, how good! those dangerous stairs had been descended, and the little voice calling in shrill tones for Hetty rang out in the wide hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="girls.c1.s11"><qs/>"Let her come to me,"<qe/> suddenly said an answering voice, and a girl of about twelve, dressed in deep mourning, suddenly opened the door of a small study and clasped the little one in her arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="girls.c1.s12"><qs/>"So you have found me, my precious, my dearest!</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c1.s13">Brave, plucky little Nan, you have got away from Nurse and found me out!</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c1.s14">Come into the study, now, darling, and you shall have some breakfast."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="girls.c1.s15"><qs/>"Me want a bicky, Hetty,"<qe/> said the baby voice; the round arms clasped Hester's neck, but the brown eyes were already travelling eagerly over the breakfast table in quest of spoil for those rosy little lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="girls.c1.s16"><qs/>"Here are two biscuits, Nan.</s> <s sid="17" id="girls.c1.s17">Nan, look me in the face--here, sit steady on my knee; you lose me, don't you Nan?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="girls.c1.s18"><qs/>"Course me do,"<qe/> said the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="girls.c1.s19"><qs/>"And I'm going away from you, Nan, darling.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c1.s20">For months and months I won't see anything of you.</s> <s sid="21" id="girls.c1.s21">My heart will be always with you, and I shall think of you morning, noon, and night.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c1.s22">I love no one as I love you, Nan.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c1.s23">You will think of me, and love me too; won't you, Nan?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="girls.c1.s24"><qs/>"Me will,"<qe/><sss/> said Nan; <sse/><qs/>"me want more bicky, Hetty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="girls.c1.s25"><qs/>"Yes, yes,"<qe/><sss/> answered Hester; <sse/><qs/>"put your arms tight round my neck, and you shall have sugar, too.</s> <s sid="26" id="girls.c1.s26">Tighter than that, Nan, and you shall have two lumps of sugar--oh, yes, you shall--I don't care if it makes you sick-- you shall have just what you want the last moment we are together."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c1.p15"><s sid="27" id="girls.c1.s27">Baby Nan was only too pleased to crumple up a crape frill and to smear a black dress with sticky little fingers for the sake of the sugar which Hetty plied her with.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="girls.c1.s28"><qs/>"More, Hetty,"<qe/><sss/> she said; <sse/><qs/>"me'll skeeze 'oo vedy tight for more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c1.p17"><s sid="29" id="girls.c1.s29">On this scene Nurse unexpectedly entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="girls.c1.s30"><qs/>"Well, I never! and so you found your way all downstairs by yourself, you little toddle.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c1.s31">Now, Miss Hetty, I hope you haven't been giving the precious lamb sugar; you know it never does suit the little dear.</s> <s sid="32" id="girls.c1.s32">Oh, fie! baby; and what sticky hands!</s> <s sid="33" id="girls.c1.s33">Miss Hetty, she has crumpled all your crape frills."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="girls.c1.s34"><qs/>"What matter?"<qe/> said Hester.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c1.s35"><qs/>"I wanted a good hug, and I gave her three or four lumps.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c1.s36">Babies won't squeeze you tight for nothing.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c1.s37">There, my Nancy, go back to Nurse.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c1.s38">Nurse, take her away; I'll break down in a minute if I see her looking at me with that little pout."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c1.p20"><s sid="39" id="girls.c1.s39">Nurse took the child into her arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="girls.c1.s40"><qs/>"Good-bye, Miss Hester, dear.</s> <s sid="41" id="girls.c1.s41">Try to be a good girl at school.</s> <s sid="42" id="girls.c1.s42">Take my word, missy--things won't be as dark as they seem."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="girls.c1.s43"><qs/>"Good-bye, Nurse,"<qe/> said Hester hastily.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c1.s44"><qs/>"Is that you, father? are you calling me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="girls.c1.s45">She gathered up her muff and gloves, and ran out of the little study where she had been making believe to eat breakfast.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c1.s46">A tall, stern-looking man was in the hall, buttoning on an overcoat; a brougham waited at the door.</s> <s sid="47" id="girls.c1.s47">The next moment Hester and her father were bowling away in the direction of the nearest railway station.</s> <s sid="48" id="girls.c1.s48">Nan's little chubby face had faded from view.</s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c1.s49">The old square grey house, sacred to Hester because of Nan, had also disappeared; the avenue even was past, and Hester closed her bright brown eyes.</s> <s sid="50" id="girls.c1.s50">She felt that she was being pushed out into a cold world, and was no longer in the same snug nest with Nan.</s> <s sid="51" id="girls.c1.s51">An intolerable pain was at her heart; she did not glance at her father, who during their entire drive occupied himself over his morning paper.</s> <s sid="52" id="girls.c1.s52">At last they reached the railway station, and just as Sir John Thornton was handing his daughter into a comfortable first-class carriage, marked <qs/>"For Ladies only,"<qe/> and was presenting her with her railway ticket and a copy of the last week's illustrated newspaper, he spoke--</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="girls.c1.s53"><qs/>"The guard will take care of you, Hester.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c1.s54">I am giving him full directions, and he will come to you at every station, and bring you tea or any refreshment you may require.</s> <s sid="55" id="girls.c1.s55">This train takes you straight to Sefton, and Mrs Willis will meet you, or send for you there.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c1.s56">Good-bye, my love; try to be a good girl, and curb your wild spirits.</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c1.s57">I hope to see you very much improved when you come home at Midsummer.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c1.s58">Good-bye, dear, good-bye.</s> <s sid="59" id="girls.c1.s59">Ah, you want to kiss me--well, just one kiss.</s> <s sid="60" id="girls.c1.s60">There-- oh, my dear! you know I have a great dislike to emotion in public."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c1.p25"><s sid="61" id="girls.c1.s61">Sir John Thornton said this because a pair of arms had been flung suddenly round his neck, and two kisses imprinted passionately on his sallow cheek.</s> <s sid="62" id="girls.c1.s62">A tear also rested on his cheek, but that he wiped away.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER 2. TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</title>
<p pid="1" id="girls.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c2.s1">The train moved rapidly on its way, and the girl in one corner of the railway carriage cried silently behind her crape veil.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c2.s2">Her tears were very subdued, but her heart felt sore, bruised, indignant; she hated the idea of school-life before her, she hated the expected restraints and the probable punishments; she fancied herself going from a free life into a prison, and detested it accordingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="girls.c2.s3">Three months before, Hester Thornton had been one of the happiest, brightest, and merriest of little girls in ---shire; but the mother who was her guardian angel, who had kept the frank and spirited child in check without appearing to do so, who had guided her by the magical power of love and not in the least by that of fear, had met her death suddenly by means of a carriage accident, and Hester and baby Nan were left motherless.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c2.s4">Several little brothers and sisters had come between Hester and Nan, but from various causes they had all died in their infancy, and only the eldest and youngest of Sir John Thornton's family remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="girls.c2.s5">Hester's father was stern, uncompromising.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c2.s6">He was a very just and upright man, but he knew nothing of the ways of children, and when Hester in her usual tom-boyish fashion climbed trees and tore her dresses, and rode bare-backed on one or two of his most dangerous horses, he not only tried a little sharp, and therefore useless, correction, but determined to take immediate steps to have his wild and rather unmanageable little daughter sent to a first-class school.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c2.s7">Hester was on her way there now, and very sore was her heart, and indignant her impulses.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c2.s8">Father's "good-bye" seemed to her to be the crowning touch to her unhappiness, and she made up her mind not to be good, not to learn her lessons, not to come home at Midsummer crowned with honours and reduced to an every-day and pattern little girl.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c2.s9">No, she would be the same wild Hetty as of yore: and when father saw that school could do nothing for her, that it could never make her into a good and ordinary little girl, he would allow her to remain at home.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c2.s10">At home there was, at least, Nan to love, and there was mother to remember.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c2.p4"><s sid="11" id="girls.c2.s11">Hetty was a child of the strongest feelings.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c2.s12">Since her mother's death she had scarcely mentioned her name.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c2.s13">When her father alluded to his wife, Hester ran out of the room: when the servants spoke of their late mistress, Hester turned pale, stamped her feet, and told them to be quiet.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="girls.c2.s14"><qs/>"You are not worthy to speak of my mother,"<qe/> she electrified them all one day by exclaiming.</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c2.s15"><qs/>"My mother is an angel now, and you--oh, you are not fit to breathe her name!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="girls.c2.s16">Only to one person would Hetty ever voluntarily say a word about the beloved dead mother, and that was to little Nan.</s> <s sid="17" id="girls.c2.s17">Nan said her prayers, as she expressed it, to Hetty now; and Hetty taught her a little phrase to use instead of the familiar <qs/>"God bless mother."<qe/></s> <s sid="18" id="girls.c2.s18">She taught the child to say, <qs/>"Thank God for making mother into a beautiful angel;"<qe/> and when Nan asked what an angel was, and how the cosy mother she remembered could be turned into one, Hester was beguiled into a soft and tearful talk, and she drew several lovely pictures of white-robed angels, until the little child was satisfied and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="girls.c2.s19"><qs/>"Me like that, Hetty--me'll be angel too, Hetty, same as mamma."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c2.p8"><s sid="20" id="girls.c2.s20">These talks with Nan, however, did not come very often, and of late they had almost ceased, for Nan was only two and a half, and the strange sad fact remained that in three months she had almost forgotten her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c2.p9"><s sid="21" id="girls.c2.s21">Hester on her way to school this morning cried for some time, then she sat silent, her crape veil still down, and her eyes watching furtively her fellow-passengers.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c2.s22">They consisted of two rather fidgety old ladies, who wrapped themselves in rugs, were very particular on the question of hot bottles, and watched Hester in their turn with considerable curiosity and interest.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c2.s23">Presently one of them offered the little girl a sandwich, which she was too proud or too shy to accept, although by this time she was feeling extremely hungry.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="girls.c2.s24"><qs/>"You will, perhaps, prefer a cake, my dear?"<qe/> said the good-natured little old lady.</s> <s sid="25" id="girls.c2.s25"><qs/>"My sister Agnes has got some delicious queen-cakes in her basket--will you eat one?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c2.p11"><s sid="26" id="girls.c2.s26">Hester murmured a feeble assent, and the queen-cake did her so much good that she ventured to raise her crape veil and to look around her.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="girls.c2.s27"><qs/>"Ah, that is much better,"<qe/> said the first little old lady.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c2.s28"><qs/>"Come to this side of the carriage, my love; we are just going to pass through a lovely bit of country, and you will like to watch the view.</s> <s sid="29" id="girls.c2.s29">See; if you place yourself here, my sister Agnes's basket will be just at your feet, and you can help yourself to a queen-cake whenever you are so disposed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="girls.c2.s30"><qs/>"Thank you,"<qe/><sls/> responded Hester, in a much more cheerful tone, for it was really quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a bright-looking little old lady; <sle/><qs/>"your queen-cakes are very nice, and I liked that one, but one is quite enough, thank you.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c2.s31">It is Nan who is so particularly fond of queen-cakes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="girls.c2.s32"><qs/>"And who is Nan, my dear?"<qe/> asked the sister to whom the queen-cakes specially belonged.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="girls.c2.s33"><qs/>"She is my dear little baby sister,"<qe/> said Hester in a sorrowful tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="girls.c2.s34"><qs/>"Ah, and it was about her you were crying just now,"<qe/> said the first lady, laying her hand on Hester's arm.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c2.s35"><qs/>"Never mind us, dear, we have seen a great many tears--a great many.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c2.s36">They are the way of the world.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c2.s37">Women are born to them.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c2.s38">As Kingsley says--<alt-qs/>`women must weep.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c2.s39">It was quite natural that you should cry about your sweet little Nan, and I wish we could send her some of these queen-cakes that you say she is so fond of.</s> <s sid="40" id="girls.c2.s40">Are you going to be long away from her, love?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="girls.c2.s41"><qs/>"Oh, yes, for months and months,"<qe/> said Hester.</s> <s sid="42" id="girls.c2.s42"><qs/>"I did not know,"<qe/><sss/> she added, <sse/><qs/>"that it was such a common thing to cry.</s> <s sid="43" id="girls.c2.s43">I never used to."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="girls.c2.s44"><qs/>"Ah, you have had other trouble, poor child,"<qe/> glancing at her deep mourning frock.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="girls.c2.s45"><qs/>"Yes, it is since then I have cried so often.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c2.s46">Please, I would rather not speak about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="girls.c2.s47"><qs/>"Quite right, my love, quite right,"<qe/> said Miss Agnes in a much brisker tone than her sister.</s> <s sid="48" id="girls.c2.s48"><qs/>"We will turn the conversation now to something inspiriting.</s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c2.s49">Jane is quite right, there are plenty of tears in the world; but there is also a great deal of sunshine and heaps of laughter, merry laughter--the laughter of youth, my child.</s> <s sid="50" id="girls.c2.s50">Now, I dare say, though you have begun your journey so sadly, that you are really bound on quite a pleasant little expedition.</s> <s sid="51" id="girls.c2.s51">For instance, you are going to visit a kind aunt, or some one else who will give you a delightful welcome."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="girls.c2.s52"><qs/>"No,"<qe/><sss/> said Hester, <sse/><qs/>"I am not.</s> <s sid="53" id="girls.c2.s53">I am going to a dreadful place, and the thought of that, and parting from little Nan, are the reasons why I cried.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c2.s54">I am going to prison--I am, indeed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="girls.c2.s55"><qs/>"Oh, my dear love!"<qe/> exclaimed both the little old ladies in a breath.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c2.s56">Then Miss Agnes continued:</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c2.s57"><qs/>"You have really taken Jane's breath away-- quite.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c2.s58">Yes, Jane, I see that you are in for an attack of palpitation.</s> <s sid="59" id="girls.c2.s59">Never mind her, dear, she palpitates very easily; but I think you must be mistaken, my love, in mentioning such an appalling word as <alt-qs/>`prison.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="60" id="girls.c2.s60">Yes, now I come to think of it, it is absolutely certain that you must be mistaken; for if you were going to such a terrible place of punishment you would be under the charge of a policeman.</s> <s sid="61" id="girls.c2.s61">You are given to strong language, dear, like other young folk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="girls.c2.s62"><qs/>"Well, I call it prison,"<qe/><sls/> continued Hester, who was rather flattered by all this bustle and Miss Jane's agitation; <sle/><qs/>"it has a dreadful sound, hasn't it?</s> <s sid="63" id="girls.c2.s63">I call it prison, but father says I am going to school--you can't wonder that I am crying, can you?</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c2.s64">Oh! what is the matter?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c2.p24"><s sid="65" id="girls.c2.s65">For the two little old ladies jumped up at this juncture, and gave Hetty a kiss apiece on her soft young lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="girls.c2.s66"><qs/>"My darling,"<qe/> they both exclaimed.</s> <s sid="67" id="girls.c2.s67"><qs/>"We are so relieved and delighted! your strong language startled us, and school is anything but what you imagine, dear.</s> <s sid="68" id="girls.c2.s68">Ah, Jane! can you ever forget our happy days at school?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c2.p26"><s sid="69" id="girls.c2.s69">Miss Jane sighed and rolled up her eyes, and then the two commenced a vigorous catechising of the little girl.</s> <s sid="70" id="girls.c2.s70">Really, Hester could not help feeling almost sunshiny before that long journey came to an end, for she and the Misses Bruce made some delightful discoveries.</s> <s sid="71" id="girls.c2.s71">The little old ladies very quickly found out that they lived close to the school where Hetty was to spend the next few months.</s> <s sid="72" id="girls.c2.s72">They knew Mrs Willis well-- they knew the delightful rambling, old-fashioned house where Hester was to live--they even knew two or three of the scholars: and they said so often to the little girl that she was going into a life of clover-- positive clover--that she began to smile, and even partly to believe them.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="girls.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="girls.c2.s73"><qs/>"I am glad I shall be near you, at least,"<qe/> she said at last, with a frank sweet smile, for she had greatly taken to her kind fellow-travellers.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c2.p28" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="girls.c2.s74"><qs/>"Yes, my dear,"<qe/> exclaimed Miss Jane.</s> <s sid="75" id="girls.c2.s75"><qs/>"We attend the same church, and I shall look out for you on Sunday, and,"<qe/><sls/> she continued, glancing first at her sister and then addressing Hester, <sle/><qs/>"perhaps Mrs Willis will allow you to visit us occasionally."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="girls.c2.p29" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="girls.c2.s76"><qs/>"I'll come to-morrow, if you like,"<qe/> said Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="girls.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="girls.c2.s77"><qs/>"Well, dear, well--that must be as Mrs Willis thinks best.</s> <s sid="78" id="girls.c2.s78">Ah, here we are at Sefton at last.</s> <s sid="79" id="girls.c2.s79">We shall look out for you in church on Sunday, my love."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c3.s1">Hester's journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c3.s2">She had taken a great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made themselves pleasant in her behalf.</s> <s sid="3" id="girls.c3.s3">She felt herself something like a heroine as she poured out a little, just a little, of her troubles into their sympathising ears; and their cheerful remarks with regard to school and school-life had caused her to see clearly that there might be another and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to her future.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c3.p2"><s sid="4" id="girls.c3.s4">But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender House, Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled.</s> <s sid="5" id="girls.c3.s5">The Misses Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to their small villa in the town, but Lavender House was some distance off, and the little omnibus never went so far.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c3.p3"><s sid="6" id="girls.c3.s6">An old-fashioned carriage, which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs Willis, had been sent to meet her, and a man whom the Misses Bruce addressed as "Thomas" helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau on the roof of the vehicle.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c3.s7">The little girl had to take her drive alone, and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed up and down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c3.s8">It was a cold winter's day, and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in Sefton, and had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender House, it was very nearly dark.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c3.s9">Hester trembled at the darkness, and when the gates were shut behind them by a rosy-faced urchin of ten, she once more began to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going to prison.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c3.p4"><s sid="10" id="girls.c3.s10">They drove slowly down a long and winding avenue, and, although Hester could not see, she knew they must be passing under trees, for several times their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c3.s11">At last they came to a standstill.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c3.s12">The old servant scrambled slowly down from his seat on the box, and, opening the carriage-door, held out his hand to help the little stranger to alight.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c3.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="girls.c3.s13"><qs/>"Come now, missy,"<qe/><sls/> he said in cheering tones, <sle/><qs/>"come out, and you'll be warm and snug in a minute.</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c3.s14">Dear, dear!</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c3.s15">I expect you're nearly froze up, poor little miss, and it _is_ a most bitter cold night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c3.p6"><s sid="16" id="girls.c3.s16">He rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch, and the next moment the wide hall door was flung open by a neat maid-servant, and Hester stepped within.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c3.p7" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="girls.c3.s17"><qs/>"She's come,"<qe/> exclaimed several voices in different keys, and proceeding apparently from different quarters.</s> <s sid="18" id="girls.c3.s18">Hester looked around her in a half-startled way, but she could see no one, except the maid, who smiled at her and said--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c3.p8" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="girls.c3.s19"><qs/>"Welcome to Lavender House, miss.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c3.s20">If you'll step into the porter's room for one moment, there is a good fire there, and I'll acquaint Miss Danesbury that you have arrived."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c3.p9"><s sid="21" id="girls.c3.s21">The little room in question was at the right-hand side of a very wide and cheerful hall, which was decorated in pale tints of green, and had a handsome encaustic-tiled floor.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c3.s22">A blazing fire and two lamps made the hall look cheerful, but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the unknown voices in the porter's small room.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c3.s23">She found herself quite trembling with shyness, and cold, and an indescribable longing to get back to Nan; and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully who or what Miss Danesbury was, she scarcely derived any comfort from the blazing fire near which she stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="girls.c3.s24"><qs/>"Rather tall for her age, but I fear, I greatly fear, a little sulky,"<qe/> said a voice behind her; and when she turned round in an agony of trepidation and terror, she suddenly found herself face to face with a tall, kind-looking, middle-aged lad and also with a bright gipsy-looking girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c3.p11" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="girls.c3.s25"><qs/>"Annie Forest, how very naughty of you to hide behind the door!</s> <s sid="26" id="girls.c3.s26">You are guilty of disobedience in coming into the room without leave.</s> <s sid="27" id="girls.c3.s27">I must report you, my dear; yes, I really must.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c3.s28">You lose two good conduct marks for this, and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your usual quantity of French poetry."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c3.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="girls.c3.s29"><qs/>"But she won't tell on me, she won't, dear old Danesbury,"<qe/><sss/> said the girl; <sse/><qs/>"she couldn't be so hard-hearted, the precious love, particularly as curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues!</s> <s sid="30" id="girls.c3.s30">Take a kiss, Danesbury, and now, a you love me you'll be merciful!"<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c3.s31">The girl flitted away, and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester, whose face had changed from red to pale during this little scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c3.p13" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="girls.c3.s32"><qs/>"What a horrid, vulgar, low-bred girl!"<qe/> she exclaimed with passion, for in all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined that personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence.</s> <s sid="33" id="girls.c3.s33"><qs/>"I hope she'll get a lot of punishment--I hope you are not going to forgive her,"<qe/> she continued, for her anger had for the time quite overcome her shyness.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c3.p14" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="girls.c3.s34"><qs/>"Oh, my dear, my dear! we should all be forgiving,"<qe/> exclaimed Miss Danesbury in her gentle voice.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c3.s35"><qs/>"Welcome to Lavender House, love; I am sorry I was not in the hall to receive you.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c3.s36">Had I been, this little _rencontre_ would not have occurred.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c3.s37">Annie Forest meant no harm, however--she's a wild little sprite, but affectionate.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c3.s38">You and she will be the best friends possible by-and-by.</s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c3.s39">Now, let me take you to your room; the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes, and I am sure you will be glad of something to eat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c3.p15"><s sid="40" id="girls.c3.s40">Miss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad, low, thickly-carpeted stairs.</s> <s sid="41" id="girls.c3.s41">When they had ascended two flights, and were standing on a handsome landing, she paused.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c3.p16" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="girls.c3.s42"><qs/>"Do you see this baize door, dear?"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="43" id="girls.c3.s43"><qs/>"This is the entrance to the school part of the house.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c3.s44">This part that we are now in belongs exclusively to Mrs Willis, and the girls are never allowed to come here without leave.</s> <s sid="45" id="girls.c3.s45">All the school-life is lived at the other side of this baize door, and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little girls who make up their minds to be brave and good.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c3.s46">Now kiss me, my dear, and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c3.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="girls.c3.s47"><qs/>"Are you our principal teacher, then?"<qe/> asked Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c3.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="girls.c3.s48"><qs/>"I? oh dear, no, my love.</s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c3.s49">I teach the younger children English, and I look after the interests and comforts of all.</s> <s sid="50" id="girls.c3.s50">I am a very useful sort of person, I believe, and I have a motherly heart, dear, and it is a way with little girls to come to me when they are in trouble.</s> <s sid="51" id="girls.c3.s51">Now, my love, we must not chatter any longer.</s> <s sid="52" id="girls.c3.s52">Take my hand, and let us get to your room as fast as possible."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c3.p19" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="girls.c3.s53">Miss Danesbury pushed open the baize door, and instantly Hester found herself in a different region.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c3.s54">Mrs Willis's part of the house gave the impression of warmth, luxuriance, and even elegance of arrangement.</s> <s sid="55" id="girls.c3.s55">At the other side of the door were long, narrow corridors, with snow-white, but carpetless floors, and rather cold, distempered walls.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c3.s56">Miss Danesbury, holding the new pupil's hand, led her down two corridors, and past a great number of shut doors, behind which Hester could near suppressed laughter and eager, chattering voices.</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c3.s57">At last, however, they stopped at a door which had the number <qs/>"32"<qe/> written over it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c3.p20" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="girls.c3.s58"><qs/>"This is your bedroom, dear,"<qe/><sss/> said the English teacher, <sse/><qs/>"and to-night you will not be sorry to have it alone.</s> <s sid="59" id="girls.c3.s59">Mrs Willis received a telegram from Susan Drummond, your room-mate, this afternoon, and she will not arrive until to-morrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c3.p21"><s sid="60" id="girls.c3.s60">However bare and even cold the corridors looked, the bedroom into which Hester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance.</s> <s sid="61" id="girls.c3.s61">It was a small, but daintily-furnished little room.</s> <s sid="62" id="girls.c3.s62">The floor was carpeted with green felt, the one window was hung with pretty draperies, and two little, narrow, white beds were arranged gracefully with French canopies.</s> <s sid="63" id="girls.c3.s63">All the furniture in the room was of a minute description, but good of its kind.</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c3.s64">Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of drawers.</s> <s sid="65" id="girls.c3.s65">At two corresponding corners were marble washhand-stands, and even two pretty, toilet tables stood side by side in the recess of the window.</s> <s sid="66" id="girls.c3.s66">But the sight that perhaps pleased Hester most was a small bright fire which burnt in the grate.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c3.p22" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="girls.c3.s67"><qs/>"Now, dear, this is your room.</s> <s sid="68" id="girls.c3.s68">As you have arrived first you can choose your own bed and your own chest of drawers.</s> <s sid="69" id="girls.c3.s69">Ah, that is right, Ellen has unfastened your portmanteau; she will unpack your trunk to-night, and take it to the box-room.</s> <s sid="70" id="girls.c3.s70">Now, dear, smooth your hair and wash your hands.</s> <s sid="71" id="girls.c3.s71">The gong will sound instantly.</s> <s sid="72" id="girls.c3.s72">I will come for you when it does."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c4.s1">Miss Danesbury, true to her word, came to fetch Hester down to tea.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c4.s2">They went down some broad carpetless stairs, along a wide stone hall, and then paused for an instant at a half-open door from which a stream of eager voices issued.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c4.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="girls.c4.s3"><qs/>"I will introduce you to your school-fellows, and I hope your future friends,"<qe/> said Miss Danesbury.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c4.s4"><qs/>"After tea you will come with me to see Mrs Willis--she is never in the school-room at tea-time.</s> <s sid="5" id="girls.c4.s5">Mdlle.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c4.s6">Perier or Miss Good usually superintends.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c4.s7">Now, my dear, come along-- why, surely you are not frightened?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c4.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="girls.c4.s8"><qs/>"Oh, please, may I sit near you?"<qe/> asked Hester.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="girls.c4.s9"><qs/>"No, my love; I take care of the little ones, and they are at a table by themselves.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c4.s10">Now, come in at once--the moment you dread will soon be over, and it is nothing, my love--really nothing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c4.p5"><s sid="11" id="girls.c4.s11">Nothing! never, as long as Hester lived, did she forget the supreme agony of terror and shyness which came over her as she entered that long, low, brightly-lighted room.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c4.s12">The forty pairs of curious eyes which were raised inquisitively to her face became as torturing as forty burning suns.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c4.s13">She felt an almost uncontrollable desire to run away and hide--she wondered if she could possibly keep from screaming aloud.</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c4.s14">In the end she found herself, she scarcely knew how, seated beside a gentle, sweet-mannered girl, and munching bread and butter which tasted drier than sawdust, and occasionally trying to sip something very hot and scalding which she vaguely understood went by the name of tea.</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c4.s15">The buzzing voices all chattering eagerly in French, and the occasional sharp, high-pitched reprimands coming in peremptory tones from the thin lips of Mdlle.</s> <s sid="16" id="girls.c4.s16">Perier, sounded far off and distant--her head was dizzy, her eyes swam--the tired and shy child endured tortures.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c4.p6"><s sid="17" id="girls.c4.s17">In after-days, in long after-years when the memory of Lavender House was to come back to Hetty Thornton as one of the sweetest, brightest episodes in her existence--in the days when she was to know almost every blade of grass in the gardens, and to be familiar with each corner of the old house, with each face which now appeared so strange, she might wonder at her feelings to-night, but never even then could she forget them.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c4.p7"><s sid="18" id="girls.c4.s18">She sat at the table in a dream, trying to eat the tasteless bread and butter.</s> <s sid="19" id="girls.c4.s19">Suddenly and swiftly the thick and somewhat stale piece of bread on her plate was exchanged for a thin, fresh, and delicately-cut slice.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c4.p8" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="girls.c4.s20"><qs/>"Eat that,"<qe/><sss/> whispered a voice--<sse/><qs/>"I know the other is horrid.</s> <s sid="21" id="girls.c4.s21">It's a shame of Perier to give such stuff to a stranger."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="girls.c4.s22"><qs/>"Mdlle.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c4.s23">Cecile, you are transgressing: you are talking English,"<qe/> came in a torrent of rapid French from the head of the table.</s> <s sid="24" id="girls.c4.s24"><qs/>"You lose a conduct mark, ma'amselle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c4.p10"><s sid="25" id="girls.c4.s25">The young girl who sat next Hester inclined her head gently and submissively, and Hester, venturing to glance at her, saw that a delicate pink had spread itself over her pale face.</s> <s sid="26" id="girls.c4.s26">She was a plain girl; but even Hester, in this first moment of terror, could scarcely have been afraid of her, so benign was her expression, so sweet the glance from her soft, full brown eyes.</s> <s sid="27" id="girls.c4.s27">Hester now further observed that the thin bread and butter had been removed from Cecil's own plate.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c4.s28">She began to wonder why this girl was indulged with better food than the rest of her comrades.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c4.p11"><s sid="29" id="girls.c4.s29">Hester was beginning to feel a little less shy, and was taking one or two furtive glances at her companions, when she suddenly felt herself turning crimson, and all her agony of shyness and dislike to her school-life returning.</s> <s sid="30" id="girls.c4.s30">She encountered the full, bright, quizzical gaze of the girl who had made personal remarks about her in the porter's room.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c4.s31">The merry black eyes of this gipsy maiden fairly twinkled with suppressed fun when they met hers, and the bright head even nodded audaciously across the table to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c4.p12"><s sid="32" id="girls.c4.s32">Not for worlds would Hester return this friendly greeting--she still held to her opinion that Miss Forest was one of the most ill-bred people she had ever met, and, in addition to feeling a considerable amount of fear of her, she quite made up her mind that she would never be on friendly terms with so underbred a girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c4.p13"><s sid="33" id="girls.c4.s33">At this moment grace was repeated in sonorous tones by a stern-looking person who sat at the foot of the long table, and whom Hester had not before noticed.</s> <s sid="34" id="girls.c4.s34">Instantly the girls rose from their seats, and began to file in orderly procession out of the tea-room.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c4.s35">Hester looked round in terror for the friendly Miss Danesbury, but she could not catch sight of her anywhere.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c4.s36">At this moment, however, her companion of the tea-table touched her arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c4.p14" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="girls.c4.s37"><qs/>"We may speak English now for half an hour,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"and most of us are going to the play-room.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c4.s38">We generally tell stories round the fire upon these dark winter's nights.</s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c4.s39">Would you like to come with me to-night?</s> <s sid="40" id="girls.c4.s40">Shall we be chums for this evening?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="girls.c4.s41"><qs/>"I don't know what `chums' are,"<qe/><sss/> said Hester; <sse/><qs/>"but,"<qe/><sls/> she added, with the dawning of a faint smile on her poor, sad little face, <sle/><qs/>"I shall be very glad to go with you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c4.p16" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="girls.c4.s42"><qs/>"Come then,"<qe/> said Cecil Temple, and she pulled Hester's hand within her arm, and walked with her across the wide stone hall, and into the largest room Hester had ever seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c4.p17"><s sid="43" id="girls.c4.s43">Never, anywhere, could there have been a more delightful play-room than this.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c4.s44">It was so large that two great fires which burned at either end were not at all too much to emit even tolerable warmth.</s> <s sid="45" id="girls.c4.s45">The room was bright with three or four lamps which were suspended from the ceiling, the floor was covered with matting, and the walls were divided into curious partitions, which gave the room a peculiar but very cosy effect.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c4.s46">These partitions consisted of large panels, and were divided by slender rails the one from the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c4.p22" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="girls.c4.s60"><qs/>"Temple is my name,"<qe/><sss/> said Cecil, <sse/><qs/>"but you need not call me that.</s> <s sid="61" id="girls.c4.s61">I am Cecil to all my friends, and you are my friend this evening, for you are my chum, you know.</s> <s sid="62" id="girls.c4.s62">Oh, you were asking me about our departments--you won't have any at first, for you have got to earn it, but I will invite you to mine pretty often.</s> <s sid="63" id="girls.c4.s63">Come now, let us go inside.</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c4.s64">Is not it just like the darlingest little drawing-room?</s> <s sid="65" id="girls.c4.s65">I am so sorry that I have only one easy chair, but you shall have it to-night, and I will sit on this three-legged stool.</s> <s sid="66" id="girls.c4.s66">I am saving up my money to buy another armchair, and Annie has promised to upholster it for me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c10.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c10.s1">Without any doubt, wild, naughty, impulsive Annie Forest was the most popular girl in the school.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c10.s2">She was always in scrapes--she was scarcely ever out of hot water--her promises of amendment were truly like the proverbial pie-crust: but she was so lovable, so kind-hearted, so saucy and piquant and pretty, that very few could resist the nameless charm which she possessed.</s> <s sid="3" id="girls.c10.s3">The little ones adored Annie, who was kindness itself to them; the bigger girls could not help admiring her fearlessness and courage; the best and noblest girls in the school tried to influence her for good.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c10.s4">She was more or less an object of interest to every one; her courage was of just the sort to captivate school-girls, and her moral weakness was not observed by these inexperienced young eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c10.p2"><s sid="5" id="girls.c10.s5">Hester alone, of all the girls who for a long time had come to Lavender House, failed to see any charm in Annie.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c10.s6">She began by considering her ill-bred, and when she found she was the school favourite, she tossed her proud little head and determined that she for one would never be subjugated by such a naughty girl.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c10.s7">Hester could read character with tolerable clearness; she was an observant child--very observant, and very thoughtful for her twelve years; and as the little witch Annie had failed to throw any spell over her, she saw her faults far more clearly than did her companions.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c10.s8">There is no doubt that this brilliant, charming, and naughty Annie had heaps of faults; she had no perseverance; she was all passion and impulse; she could be the kindest of the kind, but from sheer thoughtlessness and wildness she often inflicted severe pain, even on those she loved best.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c10.s9">Annie very nearly worshipped Mrs Willis, she had the most intense adoration for her, she respected her beyond any other human being.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c10.s10">There were moments when the impulsive and hot-headed child felt that she could gladly lay down her life for her school-mistress.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c10.s11">Once the mistress was ill, and Annie curled herself up all night outside her door, thereby breaking rules, and giving herself a severe cold; but her passion and agony were so great that she could only be soothed by at last stealing into the darkened room and kissing the face she loved.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c10.p13" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="girls.c10.s35"><qs/>"Pshaw!"<qe/> here burst from Hester's lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c10.p14" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="girls.c10.s36"><qs/>"Why do you say that?"<qe/> said Annie, turning round with her bright eyes flashing.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c10.s37"><qs/>"You've no right to be so contemptuous when I speak about our--our head-mistress.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c10.s38">Oh, Cecil,"<qe/><sss/> she continued, <sse/><qs/>"do let us give her a little surprise--some spring flowers, or something just to show her that we love her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c10.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="girls.c10.s39"><qs/>"But _you_ don't love her,"<qe/> said Hester, stoutly.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c10.p17" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="girls.c10.s46"><qs/>"You are cruel,"<qe/> she gasped, rather than spoke, and then she pushed aside the curtains of Cecil's compartment and walked out of the play-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c10.p18"><s sid="47" id="girls.c10.s47">There was a dead silence among the three girls when she left them.</s> <s sid="48" id="girls.c10.s48">Hester's heart was still hot, and she was still inclined to maintain her own position, and to believe she had done right in speaking in so severe a tone to Annie.</s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c10.s49">But even she had been made a little uneasy by the look of deep suffering which had suddenly transformed Annie's charming childish face into that of a troubled and pained woman.</s> <s sid="50" id="girls.c10.s50">She sat down meekly on her little three-legged stool and, taking up her tiny cup and saucer, sipped some of the cold tea.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c10.p19"><s sid="51" id="girls.c10.s51">Cecil Temple was the first to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c10.p20" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="girls.c10.s52"><qs/>"How could you?"<qe/> she said, in an indignant voice for her.</s> <s sid="53" id="girls.c10.s53"><qs/>"Annie is not the girl to be driven, and, in any case, it is not for you to correct her.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c10.s54">Oh, Mrs Willis would have been so pained had she heard you--you were not _kind_, Miss Thornton.</s> <s sid="55" id="girls.c10.s55">There, I don't wish to be rude, but I fear I must leave you and Miss Russell--I must try and find Annie."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c10.p21" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="girls.c10.s56"><qs/>"I'm going back to my own drawing-room,"<qe/> said Miss Russell, rising to her feet.</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c10.s57"><qs/>"Perhaps,"<qe/><sls/> she added, turning round with a very gracious smile to Hester, <sle/><qs/>"you will come and see me there, after tea, this evening."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c10.p22"><s sid="58" id="girls.c10.s58">Miss Russell drew aside the curtains of Cecil Temple's little room, and disappeared.</s> <s sid="59" id="girls.c10.s59">Hester, with her eyes full of tears, now turned eagerly to Cecil.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c10.p23" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="girls.c10.s60"><qs/>"Forgive me, Cecil,"<qe/> she exclaimed.</s> <s sid="61" id="girls.c10.s61"><qs/>"I did not mean to be unkind, but it is really quite ridiculous the way you all spoil that girl--you know as well as I do that she is a very naughty girl.</s> <s sid="62" id="girls.c10.s62">I suppose it is because of her pretty face,"<qe/><sss/> continued Hester, <sse/><qs/>"that you are all so unjust, and so blind to her faults."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c10.p24" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="girls.c10.s63"><qs/>"You are prejudiced the other way, Hester,"<qe/> said Cecil in a more gentle tone.</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c10.s64"><qs/>"You have disliked Annie from the first.</s> <s sid="65" id="girls.c10.s65">There, don't keep me--I must go to her now.</s> <s sid="66" id="girls.c10.s66">There is no knowing what harm your words may have done.</s> <s sid="67" id="girls.c10.s67">Annie is not like other girls.</s> <s sid="68" id="girls.c10.s68">If you knew her story, you would perhaps be kinder to her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c10.p25"><s sid="69" id="girls.c10.s69">Cecil then ran out of her drawing-room, leaving Hester in sole possession of the little tea-things and the three-legged stools.</s> <s sid="70" id="girls.c10.s70">She sat and thought for some time; she was a girl with a great deal of obstinacy in her nature, and she was not disposed to yield her own point, even to Cecil Temple; but Cecil's words had, nevertheless, made some impression on her.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c10.p26"><s sid="71" id="girls.c10.s71">At tea-time that night, Annie and Cecil entered the room together.</s> <s sid="72" id="girls.c10.s72">Annie's eyes were as bright as stars, and her usually pale cheeks glowed with a deep colour.</s> <s sid="73" id="girls.c10.s73">She had never looked prettier--she had never looked so defiant, so mischievous, so utterly reckless.</s> <s sid="74" id="girls.c10.s74">Mdlle.</s> <s sid="75" id="girls.c10.s75">Perier fired indignant French at her across the table.</s> <s sid="76" id="girls.c10.s76">Annie answered respectfully, and became demure in a moment; but even in the short instant in which the governess was obliged to lower her eyes to her plate, she had thrown a look so irresistibly comic at her companions, that several of them had tittered aloud.</s> <s sid="77" id="girls.c10.s77">Not once did she glance at Hester although she occasionally looked boldly in her direction; but when she did so, her versatile face assumed a blank expression, as if she were seeing nothing.</s> <s sid="78" id="girls.c10.s78">When tea was over, Dora Russell surprised the members of her own class by walking straight up to Hester, putting her hand inside her arm, and leading her off to her own very refined-looking little drawing-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="girls.c10.p27" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="girls.c10.s79"><qs/>"I want to tell you,"<qe/><sls/> she said, when the two girls found themselves inside the small inclosure, <sle/><qs/>"that I quite agree with you in your opinion of Miss Forest.</s> <s sid="80" id="girls.c10.s80">I think you were very brave to speak to her as you did to-day.</s> <s sid="81" id="girls.c10.s81">As a rule, I never trouble myself with what the little girls in the third-class do, and of course Annie seldom comes under my notice; but I think she is a decidedly spoiled child, and your rebuff will doubtless do her a great deal of good."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c10.p28"><s sid="82" id="girls.c10.s82">These words of commendation, coming from tall and dignified Miss Russell, completely turned poor Hester's head.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="girls.c19.p37"><s sid="70" id="girls.c19.s70">Hester could scarcely bear the look; she stooped down, and taking one of Nan's little dimpled hands tried to drag her away.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="girls.c19.p38"><s sid="71" id="girls.c19.s71">Instantly Annie threw the cup and ball on the floor.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c20.s1">Immediately after Easter the real excitement of the school-year began.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c20.s2">All the girls who had ambition, who had industry, and who had a desire to please distant fathers, mothers, or guardians, worked hard for that great day at Midsummer when Mrs Willis distributed her valuable prizes.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c20.p2"><s sid="3" id="girls.c20.s3">From the moment of Hester's entrance into the school she had heard this day spoken of.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c20.s4">It was, without doubt, the greatest day of the year at Lavender House.</s> <s sid="5" id="girls.c20.s5">Smaller prizes were given at Christmas, but the great honours were always reserved for this long sunshiny June day, when Mrs Willis herself presented her marks of approbation to her successful pupils.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c20.p3"><s sid="6" id="girls.c20.s6">The girls who had lived in the school for two or three years gave Hester vivid descriptions of the excitements, the pleasures, the delights of this day of days.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c20.s7">In the first place, it was the first of the holidays, in the second it was spent almost from morning to night in the open air--for a great tent was erected on the lawn; and visitors thronged to Lavender House, and fathers and mothers, and aunts and uncles, arrived from a distance to witness the triumphs of the favoured children who had won the prizes.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c20.s8">The giving away of the prizes was, of course, _the_ event of the day; but there were many other minor joys.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c20.s9">Always in the evenings there was some special entertainment.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c20.s10">These entertainments differed from year to year, Mrs Willis allowing the girls to choose them for themselves, and only making one proviso, that they must take all the trouble, and all the pains--in short, that they themselves must be the entertainers.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c20.s11">One year they had tableaux vivants; another a fancy ball, every pretty dress of which had been designed by themselves, and many even made by their own industrious little fingers.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c20.s12">Mrs Willis delighted in the interest and occupation that this yearly entertainment gave to her pupils, and she not only, encouraged them in their efforts to produce something very unique and charming, but took care that they should have sufficient time to work up their ideas properly.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c20.s13">Always after Easter she gave the girls of the three first classes two evenings absolutely to themselves; and these they spent in a pretty room called the South Parlour, which belonged to Mrs Willis's part of the house, and was rarely used, except for these great preparations.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c20.p4"><s sid="14" id="girls.c20.s14">Hester, therefore, after Easter found her days very full indeed.</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c20.s15">Every spare moment she devoted to little Nan, but she was quite determined to win a substantial prize, and she was also deeply interested in various schemes proposed in the South Parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c20.p5"><s sid="16" id="girls.c20.s16">With regard to prizes, Mrs Willis also went on a plan of her own.</s> <s sid="17" id="girls.c20.s17">Each girl was expected to come up to a certain standard of excellence in all her studies, and if she fell very much below this standard she was not allowed to try for any prize; if she came up to it, she could select one subject, but only one, for competition.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c20.p6"><s sid="18" id="girls.c20.s18">On the Monday after the Easter holidays the special subjects for the Midsummer prizes were given out, and the girls were expected to send in their answers as to the special prize they meant to compete for by the following Friday.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c20.p7"><s sid="19" id="girls.c20.s19">When this day arrived Hester Thornton and Dora Russell both discovered that they had made the same choice--they were going to try for the English composition prize.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c20.s20">This subject always obtained one of the most costly prizes, and several of the girls shook their heads over Hester's choice.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c20.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="girls.c20.s21"><qs/>"You are very silly to try for that, Hetty,"<qe/><sss/> they exclaimed, <sse/><qs/>"for Mrs Willis has such queer ideas with regard to English composition.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c20.s22">Of course, we go in for it in a general way, and learn the rules of grammar and punctuation, and so forth, but Mrs Willis says that school-girls' themes are so bad and affected, as a rule, and she says she does not think anyone will go in for her pet prize who has not natural ability.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c20.s23">In consequence, she gives only one prize for composition between the three first classes.</s> <s sid="24" id="girls.c20.s24">You had better change your mind, Hetty, before it is too late, for much older girls will compete with you, and there are several who are going to try."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c20.p9"><s sid="25" id="girls.c20.s25">Hester, however, only smiled, and assured her eager friend that she would stick to her pet subject, and try to do the best she could.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c20.p10"><s sid="26" id="girls.c20.s26">On the morning when the girls signified their choice of subject, Mrs Willis came into the school-room and made one of her little yearly speeches with regard to the right spirit in which her girls should try for these honours.</s> <s sid="27" id="girls.c20.s27">The few and well-chosen words of the head-mistress generally roused those girls who loved her best to a fever of enthusiasm, and even Hester, who was comparatively a newcomer, felt a great wish, as she listened to that clear and vibrating voice and watched the many expressions which passed over the noble face, that she might find something beyond the mere earthly honour and glory of success in this coming trial.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c20.s28">Having finished her little speech, Mrs Willis made several remarks with regard to the choice of subjects.</s> <s sid="29" id="girls.c20.s29">She spoke of the English composition prize last, and here she heightened the interest and excitement which always hung around this special prize.</s> <s sid="30" id="girls.c20.s30">Contrary to her usual rule, she would this year give no subject for an English theme.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c20.s31">Each girl might choose what pleased her best.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c20.p11"><s sid="32" id="girls.c20.s32">On nearing these words Annie Forest, who had been sitting by her desk looking rather dull and dejected, suddenly sprang to her feet, her face aglow, her eyes sparkling, and began whispering vigorously to Miss Good.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c20.p12"><s sid="33" id="girls.c20.s33">Miss Good nodded, and, going up to Mrs Willis, said aloud that Annie had changed her mind, and that from not wishing to try for any of the prizes, she now intended to compete for the English composition.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c20.p13"><s sid="34" id="girls.c20.s34">Mrs Willis looked a little surprised, but without any comment she immediately entered Annie's name in the list of competitors, and Annie sat down again, not even glancing at her astonished school-fellows, who could not conceal their amazement, for she had never hitherto shown the slightest desire to excel in this department.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c20.p14"><s sid="35" id="girls.c20.s35">On the evening of this Friday the girls of the three first classes assembled for the first time in the South Parlour.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c20.s36">Hitherto these meetings had been carried on in a systematic and business-like fashion.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c20.s37">It was impossible for all the girls who belonged to these three large classes to assemble on each occasion.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c20.s38">Careful selections, therefore, were, as a rule, made from their numbers.</s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c20.s39">These girls formed a committee to superintend and carry on the real preparations for the coming treat, and the others only met when specially summoned by the committee to appear.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c20.p15"><s sid="40" id="girls.c20.s40">As usual now the three classes found themselves in the South Parlour--as usual they chattered volubly, and started schemes, to reject them again with peals of laughter.</s> <s sid="41" id="girls.c20.s41">Many ideas were put forward, to be cast aside as utterly worthless.</s> <s sid="42" id="girls.c20.s42">No one seemed to have any very brilliant thought, and as the first step on these occasions was to select what the entertainment should be, proceedings seemed to come to a standstill.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c20.p16"><s sid="43" id="girls.c20.s43">The fact was the most daring originator, the one whoso ideas were always flavoured with a spice of novelty, was absolutely silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c20.p17"><s sid="44" id="girls.c20.s44">Cecil Temple, who had taken a seat near Annie, suddenly, bent forward and spoke to her aloud.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c20.p18" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="girls.c20.s45"><qs/>"We have all said what we would like, and we none of us appear to have thought of anything at all worth having,"<qe/><sss/> she said; <sse/><qs/>"but you have not spoken at all, Annie.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c20.s46">Give us an idea, dear--you know you originated the fancy ball last year."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c20.p19"><s sid="47" id="girls.c20.s47">Thus publicly appealed to, Annie raised her full brown eyes, glanced at her companions, not one of whom, with the exception of Cecil, returned her gaze fully; then, rising to her feet, she spoke in a slightly contemptuous tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c20.p20" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="girls.c20.s48"><qs/>"These preparations seem to me to be much ado about nothing; they lake up a lot of our time, and the results aren't worth the trouble--I have nothing particular to say.</s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c20.s49">Oh, well, yes, if you like--let's have blind man's buff and a magic lantern;"<qe/> and then, dropping a mock curtsey to her companions, she dashed out of the South Parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c20.p21" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="girls.c20.s50"><qs/>"Insufferable girl!"<qe/><sss/> said Dora Russell; <sse/><qs/>"I wonder you try to draw her out, Cecil.</s> <s sid="51" id="girls.c20.s51">You know perfectly that we none of us care to have anything to do with her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c20.p22" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="girls.c20.s52"><qs/>"I know perfectly that you are all doing your best to make her life miserable,"<qe/> said Cecil, suddenly and boldly.</s> <s sid="53" id="girls.c20.s53"><qs/>"No one in this school has obeyed Mrs Willis's command to treat Annie as innocent--you are practically sending her to Coventry, and I think it is unjust and unfair.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c20.s54">You don't know, girls, that you are ruining poor Annie's happiness."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c20.p23" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="girls.c20.s55"><qs/>"Oh, dear! she doesn't seem at all dull,"<qe/> said Miss West, a second-class girl.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c20.s56"><qs/>"I do think she's a hardened little wretch."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c20.p24" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="girls.c20.s57"><qs/>"Little you know about her,"<qe/> said Cecil, the colour fading out of her pale face.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c20.s58">Then, after a pause, she added, <qs/>"The injustice of the whole thing is that in this treatment of Annie you break the spirit of Mrs Willis's command--you, none of you, certainly tell her that she is guilty, but you treat her as such."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c20.p25"><s sid="59" id="girls.c20.s59">Here Hester Thornton said a daring thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c20.p26" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="girls.c20.s60"><qs/>"I don't believe Mrs Willis in her heart of hearts considers Annie guiltless."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="girls.c20.p27"><s sid="61" id="girls.c20.s61">These words of Hester's were laughed at by most of the girls, but Dora Russell gave her an approving nod, and Cecil, looking paler than ever, dropped suddenly into her seat, and no longer tried to defend her absent friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c20.p28" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="girls.c20.s62"><qs/>"At any rate,"<qe/> said Miss Conway, who as the head girl of the whole school was always listened to with great respect.</s> <s sid="63" id="girls.c20.s63"><qs/>"It is unfortunate for the success of our entertainment that there should be all this discussion and bad feeling with regard to Miss Forest.</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c20.s64">For my own part, I cannot make out why the poor little creature should be hunted down, or what affair it is of ours whether she is innocent or not.</s> <s sid="65" id="girls.c20.s65">If Mr Everard and Mrs Willis says she is innocent, is not that enough?</s> <s sid="66" id="girls.c20.s66">The fact of her guilt or innocence can't hurt us one way or another.</s> <s sid="67" id="girls.c20.s67">It is a great pity, however, for our own sakes, that we should be out with her now, for, whatever her faults, she is the only one of us who is ever gifted with an original thought.</s> <s sid="68" id="girls.c20.s68">But, as we can't have her, let us set to work without her--we really can't waste the whole evening over this sort of talk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="girls.c20.p29"><s sid="69" id="girls.c20.s69">Discussions as to the coming pleasure were now again resumed with vigour, and after a great deal of animated arguing it was resolved that two short plays should be acted; that a committee should be immediately formed, who should select the plays, and apportion their various parts to the different actors.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="girls.c20.p30"><s sid="70" id="girls.c20.s70">The committee selected included Miss Russell, Miss Conway, Hester Thornton, Cecil Temple, and two other girls of the second-class.</s> <s sid="71" id="girls.c20.s71">The conference then broke up, but there was a certain sense of flatness over everything, and Cecil was not the only girl who sighed for the merry meetings of last year--when Annie had been the life and soul of all the proceedings, and when one brilliant idea after another with regard to the costumes for the fancy ball had dropped from her merry tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c22.p10"><s sid="19" id="girls.c22.s19">Meanwhile Hester was very busy, very happy, and more satisfied--brighter and better employed than she had ever been in her life before.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c22.s20">Nan's love satisfied the affectionate side of her nature, and all her intellect was strained to the utmost to win honours in the coming struggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c22.p11"><s sid="21" id="girls.c22.s21">She had stuck firmly to her resolve to work for the English composition prize, and she firmly made up her own mind to leave no stone unturned to win it.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c22.s22">What affection she, possessed for Miss Russell was not at all of a character to prevent her from thoroughly enjoying taking the prize out of her hands.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c22.s23">Her love for Dora had been fed by vanity, and was not at all of a deep or noble character.</s> <s sid="24" id="girls.c22.s24">She was some time carefully choosing the subject of her theme, and at last she resolved to write a brief historical description of the last days of Marie Antoinette.</s> <s sid="25" id="girls.c22.s25">To write properly on this subject she had to read up a great deal, and had to find references in books which were not usually allowed as school-room property.</s> <s sid="26" id="girls.c22.s26">Mrs Willis, however, always allowed the girls who were working for the English composition prize to have access to her rather extensive library, and here Hester was often to be found during play-hours.</s> <s sid="27" id="girls.c22.s27">Two evenings in the week were also taken up in preparation for the coming plays, and as Hester was to take rather an important part in one, and a small character in another, she was obliged to devote herself to getting up her parts during the weekly half-holidays.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c22.s28">Thus every moment was busy, and, except at night, she had little time to devote herself to Nan.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c22.p12"><s sid="29" id="girls.c22.s29">Nan slept in a pretty crib in Hester's room, and each evening the young girl knelt down by her sister's side, and gazed at her with love which was almost motherly swelling in her breast.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c22.p13"><s sid="30" id="girls.c22.s30">All that was best of Hester was drawn out at these moments; something greater than ambition--something far and away above school triumphs and school jealousies spoke then in her heart of hearts.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c22.s31">These moments found her capable of being both sympathising and forgiving; these moments followed out in her daily life might have made Hester almost great.</s> <s sid="32" id="girls.c22.s32">Now was the time, with her eyes full of tears and her lips trembling with emotion, for Annie Forest to have caught a glimpse of the divine in Hester; the hardness, the pride, the haughty spirit were all laid aside, and hers was the true child-heart as she knelt by the sleeping baby.</s> <s sid="33" id="girls.c22.s33">Hester prayed earnestly at these moments, and, in truth, Nan did better for her than any sermon; better for her than even Mrs Willis's best influences.</s> <s sid="34" id="girls.c22.s34">Nan was as the voice of God to her sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c22.p14"><s sid="35" id="girls.c22.s35">Hester, in her very busy life, had no time to notice, however, a very slight and almost imperceptible change in bright little Nan.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c22.s36">In the mornings she was in too great a hurry to pay much heed to the little one's chatter; in the afternoons she had scarcely an instant to devote to her, and when she saw her playing happily with the other children she was quite content, and always supposed that when a spare half-hour did come in her busy life Nan would rush to her with the old ecstasy, and give her the old devotion.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c22.p15"><s sid="37" id="girls.c22.s37">One day, toward the end of a very fine May, the girls were all to go for a picnic to some woods about four miles away.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c22.s38">They had looked forward for several days to this relaxation, and were in the highest state of delight and the wildest spirits.</s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c22.s39">After an early dinner they were to drive in several large waggonettes to the place of _rendezvous_, where they were to be regaled with gypsy-tea, and were to have a few hours in the lovely Woods or Burn Castle, one of the show places of the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="40" id="girls.c22.s40">Mrs Willis had invited the Misses Bruce to accompany them, and they were all to leave the house punctually at two o'clock.</s> <s sid="41" id="girls.c22.s41">The weather was wonderfully fine and warm, and it was decided that all the children, even Nan, should go.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c22.p16"><s sid="42" id="girls.c22.s42">Perhaps none of the girls looked forward to this day's pleasure with greater joy than did Hester; she determined to make it a real holiday, and a real time of relaxation.</s> <s sid="43" id="girls.c22.s43">She would forget her English theme; she would cease to worry herself about Marie Antoinette; she would cease to repeat her part in the coming play; and she would devote herself exclusively and determinedly to Nan's pleasure.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c22.s44">She pictured the little one's raptures; she heard her gay shouts of joy, her ceaseless little rippling chatter, her baby glee, and, above all things, her intense happiness at being with her own Hetty for the greater part of a whole day.</s> <s sid="45" id="girls.c22.s45">Hester would ride her on her shoulder, would race with her; all her usual, companions would be as nothing to her on this occasion, she would give herself up solely to Nan.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c22.p17"><s sid="46" id="girls.c22.s46">As she was dressing that morning she said a word or two to the child about the coming treat.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c22.p23"><s sid="55" id="girls.c22.s55">Hester scarcely heard the last words, for the prayer-gong sounded, and she had to fly downstairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c22.p24"><s sid="56" id="girls.c22.s56">At dinner time the girls were discussing who would go with each, and all were very merry and full of fun.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c28.p2"><s sid="5" id="girls.c28.s5">The poor, sleepy rabbits must have been astonished that night at the shouts of the revellers, as they hurried past them, and the birds must have taken their sleepy heads from under their downy wings, and wondered if the morning had come some hours before its usual time.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c28.p3"><s sid="6" id="girls.c28.s6">More than one solemn old owl blinked at them, and hooted as they passed, and told them in owl language what silly, naughty young things they were, and how they would repent of this dissipation by-and-by.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c28.s7">But if the girls were to have an hour of remorse, it did not visit them then; their hearts were like feathers, and by the time they reached the fields where the fairies were supposed to play their spirits had become almost uncontrollable.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c28.p4"><s sid="8" id="girls.c28.s8">Luckily for them this small green field lay in a secluded hollow, and more luckily for them no tramps were about to hear their merriment.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c28.s9">Rover, who constituted himself Annie's protector, now lay down by her side, and as she was the real ringleader and queen of the occasion, she ordered her subjects about pretty sharply.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c28.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="girls.c28.s10"><qs/>"Now, girls, quick; open the basket.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c28.s11">Yes, I'm going to rest.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c28.s12">I have organised the whole thing, and I'm fairly tired; so I'll just sit quietly here, and Rover will take care of me while you set things straight.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c28.s13">Ah! good Betty; she did not even forget the white table-cloth."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c28.p6"><s sid="14" id="girls.c28.s14">Here one of the girls remarked casually that the grass was wet with dew, and that it was well they had all put on their waterproofs.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c28.p7"><s sid="15" id="girls.c28.s15">Annie interrupted again in a petulant voice--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c28.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="girls.c28.s16"><qs/>"Don't croak, Mary Morris.</s> <s sid="17" id="girls.c28.s17">Out with the chickens, lay the ham in this corner, and the cherries will make a picturesque pile in the middle.</s> <s sid="18" id="girls.c28.s18">Twelve meringues in all, that means a meringue and a half each.</s> <s sid="19" id="girls.c28.s19">We shall have some difficulty in dividing.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c28.s20">Oh, dear! oh, dear! how hungry I am!</s> <s sid="21" id="girls.c28.s21">I was far too excited to eat anything at supper-time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c28.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="girls.c28.s22"><qs/>"So was I,"<qe/> said Phyllis, coming up and pressing close to Annie.</s> <s sid="23" id="girls.c28.s23"><qs/>"I do think Miss Danesbury cuts the bread and butter too thick--don't you, Annie?</s> <s sid="24" id="girls.c28.s24">I could not eat mine at all, to-night, and Cecil Temple asked me if I was not well."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c28.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="girls.c28.s25"><qs/>"Those who don't want chicken hold up their hands,"<qe/> here interrupted Annie, who had tossed her brown cap on the grass, and between whose brows a faint frown had passed for an instant at the mention of Cecil's name.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c28.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="girls.c28.s26">The feast now began in earnest, and silence reigned for a short time, broken only by the clatter of plates, and such an occasional remark as <qs/>"Pass the salt, please,"<qe/> <qs/>"Pepper this way, if you've no objection,"<qe/> <qs/>"How good chicken tastes in fairy-land,"<qe/> etc.</s> <s sid="27" id="girls.c28.s27">At last the ginger-beer bottles began to pop--the girl's first hunger was appeased.</s> <s sid="28" id="girls.c28.s28">Rover gladly crunched up all the bones, and conversation flowed once more, accompanied by the delicate diversion of taking alternate bites at meringues and cheesecakes.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c28.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="girls.c28.s29"><qs/>"I wish the fairies would come out,"<qe/> said Annie.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c28.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="girls.c28.s30"><qs/>"Oh, don't!"<qe/> shivered Phyllis, looking round her nervously.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c28.p14" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="girls.c28.s31"><qs/>"Annie, darling, do tell us a ghost story,"<qe/> cried several voices.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c28.p15"><s sid="32" id="girls.c28.s32">Annie laughed, and commenced a series of nonsense tales, all of a slightly eerie character, which she made up on the spot.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c28.p16"><s sid="33" id="girls.c28.s33">The moon riding high in the heavens looked down on the young giddy heads, and their laughter, naughty as they were, sounded sweet in the night air.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c28.p17"><s sid="34" id="girls.c28.s34">Time flew quickly, and the girls suddenly discovered that they must pack up their table-cloth and remove all traces of the feast unless they wished the bright light of morning to discover them.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c28.s35">They rose hastily, sighing, and slightly depressed now that their fun was over.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c28.s36">The white table-cloth, no longer very white, was packed into the basket, the ginger-beer bottles placed on top of it, and the lid fastened down.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c28.s37">Not a crumb of the feast remained; Rover had demolished the bones, and the eight girls had made short work of everything else, with the exception of the cherry-stones, which Phyllis carefully collected and popped into a little hole in the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c28.p18"><s sid="38" id="girls.c28.s38">The party then progressed slowly homewards, and once more entered the dark wood.</s> <s sid="39" id="girls.c28.s39">They were much more silent now; the wood was darker, and the chill which foretells the dawn was making itself felt in the air.</s> <s sid="40" id="girls.c28.s40">Either the sense of cold, or a certain effect produced by Annie's ridiculous stories, made many of the little party unduly nervous.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c28.p19"><s sid="41" id="girls.c28.s41">They had only taken a few steps through the wood when Phyllis suddenly uttered a piercing shriek.</s> <s sid="42" id="girls.c28.s42">This shriek was echoed by Nora and by Mary Morris, and all their hearts seemed to leap into their mouths when they saw something move among the trees.</s> <s sid="43" id="girls.c28.s43">Rover uttered a growl, and, but for Annie's detaining hand, would have sprung forward.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c28.s44">The high-spirited girl was not to be easily daunted.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c28.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="girls.c28.s45"><qs/>"Behold, girls, the goblin of the woods,"<qe/> she exclaimed.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c28.s46"><qs/>"Quiet, Rover; stand still."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c28.p21"><s sid="47" id="girls.c28.s47">The next instant the fears of the little party reached their culmination when a tall, dark figure stood directly in their paths.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="girls.c28.p22" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="girls.c28.s48"><qs/>"If you don't let us pass at once,"<qe/><sss/> said Annie's voice, <sse/><qs/>"I'll set Rover at you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="girls.c28.p23"><s sid="49" id="girls.c28.s49">The dog began to bark loudly, and quivered from head to foot.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="girls.c28.p24"><s sid="50" id="girls.c28.s50">The figure moved a little to one side, and a rather deep and slightly dramatic voice said--</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c28.p25" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="girls.c28.s51"><qs/>"I mean you no harm, young ladies; I'm only a gypsy-mother from the tents yonder.</s> <s sid="52" id="girls.c28.s52">You are welcome to get back to Lavender House.</s> <s sid="53" id="girls.c28.s53">I have then one course plain before me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c28.p26" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="girls.c28.s54"><qs/>"Come on, girls,"<qe/> said Annie, now considerably frightened, while Phyllis, and Nora, and one or two more began to sob.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="girls.c28.p27" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="girls.c28.s55"><qs/>"Look here, young ladies,"<qe/><sls/> said the gypsy in a whining voice, <sle/><qs/>"I don't mean you no harm, my pretties, and it's no affair of mine telling the good ladies at Lavender House what I've seen.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c28.s56">You cross my hand, dears, each of you, with a bit of silver, and all I'll do is to tell your pretty fortunes, and mum is the word with the gypsy-mother as far as this night's prank is concerned."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c28.p28" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="girls.c28.s57"><qs/>"We had better do it, Annie--we had better do it,"<qe/> here sobbed Phyllis.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c28.s58"><qs/>"If this was found out by Mrs Willis we might be expelled--we might, indeed; and that horrid woman is sure to tell of us--I know she is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="girls.c28.p29" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="girls.c28.s59"><qs/>"Quite sure to tell, dear,"<qe/> said the tall gypsy, dropping a curtsey in a manner which looked frightfully sarcastic in the long shadows made by the trees.</s> <s sid="60" id="girls.c28.s60"><qs/>"Quite sure to tell, and to be expelled is the very least that could happen to such naughty little ladies.</s> <s sid="61" id="girls.c28.s61">Here's a nice little bit of clearing in the wood, and we'll all come over, and Mother Rachel will tell your fortunes in a twinkling, and no one will be the wiser.</s> <s sid="62" id="girls.c28.s62">Sixpence apiece, my dears--only sixpence apiece."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="girls.c28.p30" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="girls.c28.s63"><qs/>"Oh, come; do, do come,"<qe/> said Nora, and the next moment they were all standing in a circle round Mother Rachel, who pocketed her black-mail eagerly, and repeated some gibberish over each little hand.</s> <s sid="64" id="girls.c28.s64">Over Annie's palm she lingered for a brief moment, and looked with her penetrating eyes into the girl's face.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="girls.c28.p31" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="girls.c28.s65"><qs/>"You'll have suffering before you, miss; some suspicion, and danger even to life itself.</s> <s sid="66" id="girls.c28.s66">But you'll triumph, my dear, you'll triumph.</s> <s sid="67" id="girls.c28.s67">You're a plucky one, and you'll do a brave deed.</s> <s sid="68" id="girls.c28.s68">There--good-night, young ladies; you have nothing more to fear from Mother Rachel."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="girls.c28.p32" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="girls.c28.s69">The tall dark figure disappeared into the blackest shadows of the wood, and the girls, now like so many frightened hares, flew home.</s> <s sid="70" id="girls.c28.s70">They deposited their basket where Betty would find it, under the shadow of the great laurel in the back avenue.</s> <s sid="71" id="girls.c28.s71">They all bade Rover an affectionate <qs/>"good-night."<qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="girls.c28.s72">Annie softly unlocked the side door, and one by one, with their shoes in their hands, they regained their bedrooms.</s> <s sid="73" id="girls.c28.s73">They were all very tired, and very cold, and a dull fear and sense of insecurity rested over each little heart.</s> <s sid="74" id="girls.c28.s74">Suppose Mother Rachel proved unfaithful, notwithstanding the sixpences?</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER 29. HESTER'S FORGOTTEN BOOK.</title>
<p pid="1" id="girls.c29.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c29.s1">It wanted scarcely three weeks to the holidays, and therefore scarcely three weeks to that auspicious day when Lavender House was to be the scene of one long triumph, and was to be the happy spot selected for a Midsummer holiday, accompanied by all that could make a holiday perfect--for youth and health would be there, and even the unsuccessful competitors for the great prizes would not have too sore hearts, for they would know that on the next day they were going home.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c29.s2">Each girl who had done her best would have a word of commendation, and only those who were very naughty, or very stubborn, could resist the all-potent elixir of happiness which would be poured out so abundantly for Mrs Willis's pupils on this day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c29.p2"><s sid="3" id="girls.c29.s3">Now that the time was drawing so near, those girls who were working for prizes found themselves fully occupied from morning to night.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c29.s4">In play-hours even, girls would be seen with their heads bent over their books, and, between the prizes and the acting, no little bees in any hive could be more constantly employed than were these young girls just now.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c29.p3"><s sid="5" id="girls.c29.s5">No happiness is, after all, to be compared to the happiness of healthful occupation.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c29.s6">Busy people have no time to fret and no time to grumble.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c29.s7">According to our old friend, Dr Watts, people who are healthily busy have also no time to be naughty, for the old doctor says that it is for idle hands that mischief is prepared.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c29.p4"><s sid="8" id="girls.c29.s8">Be that as it may, and there is great truth in it, some naughty sprites, some bad fairies, were flitting around and about that apparently peaceful atmosphere.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c29.s9">That sunny home, governed by all that was sweet and good, was not without its serpent.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c29.p5"><s sid="10" id="girls.c29.s10">Of all the prizes which attracted interest and aroused competition, the prize for English composition was this year the most popular.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c29.s11">In the first place, this was known to be Mrs Willis's own favourite subject.</s> <s sid="12" id="girls.c29.s12">She had a great wish that her girls should write intelligibly--she had a greater wish that, if possible, they should think.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c29.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="girls.c29.s13"><qs/>"Never was there so much written and printed,"<qe/><sls/> she was often heard to say; <sle/><qs/>"but can anyone show me a book with thoughts in it?</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c29.s14">Can anyone show me, unless as a rare exception, a book which will live?</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c29.s15">Oh, yes, these books which issue from the press in thousands are, many of them, very smart, a great many of them clever, but they are thrown off too quickly.</s> <s sid="16" id="girls.c29.s16">All great things, great books amongst them, must be evolved slowly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c29.p7"><s sid="17" id="girls.c29.s17">Then she would tell her pupils what she considered the reason of this.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="girls.c29.p8" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="girls.c29.s18"><qs/>"In these days,"<qe/><sss/> she would say, <sse/><qs/>"all girls are what is called highly educated.</s> <s sid="19" id="girls.c29.s19">Girls and boys alike must go in for competitive examinations, must take out diplomas, and must pass certain standards of excellence.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c29.s20">The system is cramming from beginning to end.</s> <s sid="21" id="girls.c29.s21">There is no time for reflection.</s> <s sid="22" id="girls.c29.s22">In short, my dear girls, you swallow a great deal, but you do not digest your intellectual food."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c29.p9"><s sid="23" id="girls.c29.s23">Mrs Willis hailed with pleasure any little dawnings of real thought in her girls' prize essays.</s> <s sid="24" id="girls.c29.s24">More than once she bestowed the prize upon the essay which seemed to the girls the most crude and unfinished.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c29.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="girls.c29.s25"><qs/>"Never mind,"<qe/><sss/> she would say, <sse/><qs/>"here is an idea--or at least half an idea.</s> <s sid="26" id="girls.c29.s26">This little bit of composition is original, and not, at best, a poor imitation of Sir Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c29.p11"><s sid="27" id="girls.c29.s27">Thus the girls found a strong stimulus to be their real selves in these little essays, and the best of them chose their subject and let it ferment in their brains without the aid of books, except for the more technical parts.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c29.p12"><s sid="28" id="girls.c29.s28">More than one girl in the school was surprised at Dora Russell exerting herself to try for the prize essay.</s> <s sid="29" id="girls.c29.s29">She was just about to close her school career, and they could not make out why she roused herself to work for the most difficult prize, for which she would have to compete with any girl in the school who chose to make a similar attempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c29.p13"><s sid="30" id="girls.c29.s30">Dora, however, had her own, not very high motive for making the attempt.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c29.s31">She was a thoroughly accomplished girl, graceful in her appearance and manner; in short, just the sort of girl who would be supposed to do credit to a school.</s> <s sid="32" id="girls.c29.s32">She played with finish, and even delicacy of touch.</s> <s sid="33" id="girls.c29.s33">There was certainly no soul in her music, but neither were there any wrong notes.</s> <s sid="34" id="girls.c29.s34">Her drawings were equally correct, her perspective good, her trees were real trees, and the colouring of her water-colour sketches was pure.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c29.s35">She spoke French extremely well, and with a correct accent, and her German also was above the average.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c29.s36">Nevertheless, Dora was commonplace, and those girls who knew her best spoke sarcastically, and smiled at one another when she alluded to her prize essay, and seemed confident of being the successful competitor.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c29.p14" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="girls.c29.s37"><qs/>"You won't like to be beaten, Dora, say, by Annie Forest,"<qe/> they would laughingly remark; whereupon Dora's calm face would slightly flush and her lips would assume a very proud curve.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c29.s38">If there was one thing she could not bear it was to be beaten.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="girls.c29.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="girls.c29.s39"><qs/>"Why do you try for it, Dora?"<qe/> her class-fellows would ask; but here Dora made no reply: she kept her reason to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c29.p16"><s sid="40" id="girls.c29.s40">The fact was Dora, who must be a copyist to the end of the chapter, and who could never to her latest day do anything original, had determined to try for the composition prize because she happened accidentally to hear a conversation between Mrs Willis and Miss Danesbury, in which something was said about a gold locket with Mrs Willis's portrait inside.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c29.p17" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="girls.c29.s41">Dora instantly jumped at the conclusion that this was to be the great prize bestowed upon the successful essayist.</s> <s sid="42" id="girls.c29.s42">Delightful idea; how well the trinket would look round her smooth white throat!</s> <s sid="43" id="girls.c29.s43">Instantly she determined to try for this prize, and of course as instantly the bare idea of defeat became intolerable to her.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c29.s44">She went steadily and methodically to work.</s> <s sid="45" id="girls.c29.s45">With extreme care she chose her subject.</s> <s sid="46" id="girls.c29.s46">Knowing something of Mrs Willis's peculiarities, she determined that her theme should not be historical; she believed that she could express herself freely and with power if only she could secure an un-hackneyed subject.</s> <s sid="47" id="girls.c29.s47">Suddenly an idea which she considered brilliant occurred to her.</s> <s sid="48" id="girls.c29.s48">She would call her composition <qs/>"The River."<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="girls.c29.s49">This should not bear reference to Father Thames, or any other special river of England, but it should trace the windings of some fabled stream of Dora's imagination, which, as it flowed along, should tell something of the story of the many places by which it passed.</s> <s sid="50" id="girls.c29.s50">Dora was charmed with her own thought, and worked hard, evening after evening, at her subject, covering sheets of manuscript paper with pencilled jottings, and arranging and rearranging her somewhat confused thoughts.</s> <s sid="51" id="girls.c29.s51">She greatly admired a perfectly rounded period, and she was most particular as to the style in which she wrote.</s> <s sid="52" id="girls.c29.s52">For the purpose of improving her style she even studied old volumes of Addison's _Spectator_; but after a time she gave up this course of study, for she found it so difficult to mould her English to Addison's that she came to the comfortable conclusion that Addison was decidedly obsolete, and that if she wished to do full justice to "The River" she must trust to her own unaided genius.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="girls.c29.p18"><s sid="53" id="girls.c29.s53">At last the first ten pages were written.</s> <s sid="54" id="girls.c29.s54">The subject was entered upon with considerable flourishes, and some rather apt poetical quotations from a book containing a collection of poems; the river itself had already left its home in the mountain, and was careering merrily past sunny meadows and little rural, impossible cottages, where the golden-haired children played.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c29.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="girls.c29.s55">Dora made a very neat copy of her essay so far.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c29.s56">She now began to see her way clearly--there would be a very powerful passage as the river approached the murky town.</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c29.s57">Here, indeed, would be room for powerful and pathetic writing.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c29.s58">She wondered if she might venture so far as to hide a suicide in her rushing waters; and then at last the brawling river would lose itself in the sea; and, of course, there would not be the smallest connection between her river, and Kingsley's well-known song, <qs/>"Clear and cool."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c29.p20"><s sid="59" id="girls.c29.s59">She finished writing her ten pages, and being now positively certain of her gold locket, went to bed in a happy state of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c36.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="girls.c36.s6"><qs/>"My own wish is that this should be found out.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c36.s7">As a matter of course, I sha'n't betray you, girls; but as things now stand I am anxious that Mrs Willis should know the very worst of me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c36.p3"><s sid="8" id="girls.c36.s8">After a remark which Susan considered so simply idiotic, there was, of course, no further conversation between the two girls.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c36.p4"><s sid="9" id="girls.c36.s9">Moses Moore had certainly promised Betty to rise soon after dawn on the following morning and go to Lavender House to carry off the basket from under the laurel-tree.</s> <s sid="10" id="girls.c36.s10">Moses, a remarkably indolent lad, had been stimulated by the thought of the delicious cherries which would be his as soon as he brought the basket to Betty.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c36.s11">He had cleverly stipulated that a quart--not a pint--of cherries was to be his reward, and he looked forward with considerable pleasure to picking them himself, and putting a few extra ones into his mouth on the sly.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c36.p5"><s sid="12" id="girls.c36.s12">Moses was not at all the kind of boy who would have scrupled to steal a few cherries; but in this particular old Betty, ill as she was, was too sharp for him, or for any of the other village lads.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c36.s13">Her bed was drawn up close to her little window, and her window looked directly on to the two cherry trees.</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c36.s14">Never, to all appearance, did Betty close her eyes.</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c36.s15">However early the hour might be in which a village boy peeped over the wall of her garden, he always saw her white night-cap moving, and he knew that her bright blue eyes would be on him, and he would be proclaimed a thief all over the place before many minutes were over.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c36.p6"><s sid="16" id="girls.c36.s16">Moses, therefore, was very glad to secure his cherries by fair means, as he could not obtain them by foul; and he went to bed and to sleep determined to be off on his errand with the dawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="girls.c36.p7"><s sid="17" id="girls.c36.s17">A very natural thing, however, happened.</s> <s sid="18" id="girls.c36.s18">Moses, unaccustomed to getting up at half-past three in the morning, never opened his eyes until the church clock struck five.</s> <s sid="19" id="girls.c36.s19">Then he started upright, rubbed and rubbed at his sleepy orbs, tumbled into his clothes, and, softly opening the cottage door, set off on his errand.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c36.p10"><s sid="30" id="girls.c36.s30">Under these circumstances, Moses thought it quite unnecessary to retain any self-control.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c36.s31">He shrieked, he screamed, he wriggled; his piercing yells filled the air, and, fortunately for him, his being two hours too late brought assistance to his aid.</s> <s sid="32" id="girls.c36.s32">Michael, the gardener, and a strong boy who helped him, rushed to the spot, and liberated the terrified lad, who, after all, was only frightened, for Rover had satisfied himself with tearing his jacket to pieces, not himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c36.p11" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="girls.c36.s33"><qs/>"Give me the b-basket,"<qe/><sss/> sobbed Moses, <sse/><qs/>"and let me g-g-go."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c36.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="girls.c36.s37"><qs/>"Old B-B-Betty,"<qe/> gasped forth the agitated Moses.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c36.p16"><s sid="44" id="girls.c36.s44">Michael, looking gravely at Jim, opened the basket, examined its contents, and, shaking his head solemnly, carried it into the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c44.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c44.s1">It is one thing to talk of the delights of sleeping under a hedge-row and another to realise them.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c44.s2">A hayfield is a very charming place, but in the middle of the night, with the dew clinging to everything, it is apt to prove but a chilly bed; the most familiar objects put on strange and unreal forms, the most familiar sounds become loud and alarming.</s> <s sid="3" id="girls.c44.s3">Annie slept for about an hour soundly; then she awoke, trembling with cold in every limb, startled and almost terrified by the oppressive loneliness of the night, sure that the insect life which surrounded her, and which would keep up successions of chirps, and croaks, and buzzes, was something mysterious and terrifying.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c44.s4">Annie was a brave child, but even brave little girls may be allowed to possess nerves under her present conditions, and when a spider ran across her face she started up with a scream of terror.</s> <s sid="5" id="girls.c44.s5">At this moment she almost regretted the close and dirty lodgings which she might have obtained for a few pence at Oakley.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c44.s6">The hay in the field which she had selected was partly cut and partly standing.</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c44.s7">The cut portion had been piled up into little cocks and hillocks, and these, with the night shadows round them, appeared to the frightened child to assume large and half-human proportions.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c44.s8">She found she could not sleep any longer.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c44.s9">She wrapped her shawl tightly round her, and, crouching into the hedge-row, waited for the dawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c44.p2"><s sid="10" id="girls.c44.s10">That watched-for dawn seemed to the tired child as if it would never come; but at last her solitary vigil came to an end, the cold grew greater, a little gentle breeze stirred the uncut grass, and up in the sky overhead the stars became fainter and the atmosphere clearer.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c44.s11">Then came a little faint flush of pink, then a brighter light, and then all in a moment the birds burst into a perfect jubilee of song, the insects talked and chirped and buzzed in new tones, the hay-cocks became simply hay-cocks, the dew sparkled on the wet grass, the sun had risen, and the new day had begun.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c45.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c45.s1">It was still very, very early in the morning, and the gipsy folk, tired from their march on the preceding day, slept.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c45.s2">There stood the conical, queer-shaped tents, four in number; at a little distance off grazed the donkeys and a couple of rough mules; at the door of the tents lay stretched out in profound repose two or three dogs.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c45.p3"><s sid="4" id="girls.c45.s4">She stood still for a moment--she was very anxious to prowl around the place and examine the ground while the gipsies still slept, but the watchful dogs deterred her.</s> <s sid="5" id="girls.c45.s5">She stood perfectly quiet behind the hedge-row, thinking hard.</s> <s sid="6" id="girls.c45.s6">Should she trust to a charm she knew she possessed, and venture into the encampment?</s> <s sid="7" id="girls.c45.s7">Annie had almost as great a fascination over dogs and cats as she had over children.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c45.s8">As a little child going to visit with her mother at strange houses, the watch-dogs never barked at her; on the contrary, they yielded to the charm which seemed to come from her little fingers as she patted their great heads.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c45.s9">Slowly their tails would move backwards and forwards as she petted them, and even the most ferocious would look at her with affection.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="girls.c45.p4"><s sid="10" id="girls.c45.s10">Annie wondered if the gipsy dogs would now allow her to approach without barking.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c45.s11">She felt that the chances were in her favour; she was dressed in gipsy garments, there would be nothing strange in her appearance, and if she could get near one of the dogs she knew that she could exercise the magic of her touch.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c45.p5"><s sid="12" id="girls.c45.s12">Her object, then, was to approach one of the tents very, very quietly-- so softly that even the dog's ears should not detect the light footfall.</s> <s sid="13" id="girls.c45.s13">If she could approach close enough to put her hand on the dog's neck all would be well.</s> <s sid="14" id="girls.c45.s14">She pulled off the gipsy maid's rough shoes, hid them in the grass where she could find them again, and came gingerly, step by step, nearer and nearer the principal tent.</s> <s sid="15" id="girls.c45.s15">At its entrance lay a ferocious-looking half-bred bull-dog.</s> <s sid="16" id="girls.c45.s16">Annie possessed that necessary accompaniment to courage--great outward calm; the greater the danger, the more cool and self-possessed did she become.</s> <s sid="17" id="girls.c45.s17">She was within a step or two of the tent when she trod accidentally on a small twig: it cracked, giving her foot a sharp pain, and, very slight as the sound was, causing the bull-dog to awake.</s> <s sid="18" id="girls.c45.s18">He raised his wicked face, saw the figure like his own people, and yet unlike, but a step or two away, and, uttering a low growl, sprang forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c45.p6" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="girls.c45.s19">In the ordinary course of things this growl would have risen in volume and would have terminated in a volley of barking; but Annie was prepared: she went down on her knees, held out her arms, said, <qs/>"Poor fellow!"<qe/> in her own seductive voice, and the bull-dog fawned at her feet.</s> <s sid="20" id="girls.c45.s20">He licked one of her hands while she patted him gently with the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="girls.c45.p9"><s sid="28" id="girls.c45.s28">Annie's idea now was that little Nan was hidden in one of these vaults, and she determined first to make sure of its existence, and then to venture herself into this underground region in search of the lost child.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="girls.c45.p10"><s sid="29" id="girls.c45.s29">She had made a decided conquest in the person of Tiger, who followed her round and round the tents, and when the gipsies at last began to stir and Annie crept into the hedge-row, the dog crouched by her side.</s> <s sid="30" id="girls.c45.s30">Tiger was the favourite dog of the camp, and presently one of the men called to him; he rose unwillingly, looked back with longing eyes at Annie, and trotted off, to return in the space of about five minutes with a great bunch of broken bread in his mouth.</s> <s sid="31" id="girls.c45.s31">This was his breakfast, and he meant to share it with his new friend.</s> <s sid="32" id="girls.c45.s32">Annie was too hungry to be fastidious, and she also knew the necessity of keeping up her strength.</s> <s sid="33" id="girls.c45.s33">She crept still farther under the hedge, and the dog and girl shared the broken bread between them.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="girls.c45.p11"><s sid="34" id="girls.c45.s34">Presently the tents were all astir; the gipsy children began to swarm about, the women lit fires in the open air, and the smell of very appetising breakfasts filled the atmosphere.</s> <s sid="35" id="girls.c45.s35">The men also lounged into view, standing lazily at the doors of their tents, and smoking great pipes of tobacco.</s> <s sid="36" id="girls.c45.s36">Annie lay quiet.</s> <s sid="37" id="girls.c45.s37">She could see from her hiding-place without being seen.</s> <s sid="38" id="girls.c45.s38">Suddenly--and her eyes began to dilate, and she found her heart beating strangely--she laid her hand on Tiger, who was quivering all over.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="girls.c45.p12" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="girls.c45.s39"><qs/>"Stay with me, dear dog,"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c45.p13"><s sid="40" id="girls.c45.s40">There was a great commotion and excitement in the gipsy camp; the children screamed and ran into the tents, the women paused in their preparation for breakfast, the men took their short pipes out of their mouths; every dog, with the exception of Tiger, barked ferociously.</s> <s sid="41" id="girls.c45.s41">Tiger and Annie alone were motionless.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="girls.c45.p14"><s sid="42" id="girls.c45.s42">The cause of all this uproar was a body of police, about six in number, who came boldly into the field, and demanded instantly to search the tents.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="girls.c45.p16"><s sid="46" id="girls.c45.s46">The men stood about; the women came near; the children crept out of their tents, placing their fingers to their frightened lips, and staring at the men who represented those horrors to their unsophisticated minds called Law and Order.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="girls.c49.p13"><s sid="25" id="girls.c49.s25">Whether Susan would really have gone with Hester remains to be proved, but just at that moment all possibility of retreat was cut away from her by Miss Agnes Bruce, who quietly entered Mrs Willis's private sitting-room, followed by the very man Hester was about to seek.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="girls.c49.p17"><s sid="39" id="girls.c49.s39">With these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room, closing the door after her.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="girls.c49.p19" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="girls.c49.s43"><qs/>"Tell me what is wrong, my poor child,"<qe/> said Mr Everard.</s> <s sid="44" id="girls.c49.s44">He laid his hand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the agitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and of her deep, though until now unavailing repentance.</s> <s sid="45" id="girls.c49.s45">How from the first she had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her; how she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the clew was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had determined not to use it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="girls.c49.p20" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="girls.c49.s46"><qs/>"From the day Nan was lost,"<qe/><sss/> continued Hester, <sse/><qs/>"it has been all agony and all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell!</s> <s sid="47" id="girls.c49.s47">I was too proud to humble myself to the very dust!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="girls.c49.p21" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="girls.c49.s48"><qs/>"But not now,"<qe/> said the clergyman very gently.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="girls.c49.p25" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="girls.c49.s54"><qs/>"No, Hester,"<qe/><sss/> answered Mr Everard, <sse/><qs/>"you want more than that--you want far more than that.</s> <s sid="55" id="girls.c49.s55">It may be that God will take Annie Forest away.</s> <s sid="56" id="girls.c49.s56">We cannot tell.</s> <s sid="57" id="girls.c49.s57">With Him alone are the issues of life or death.</s> <s sid="58" id="girls.c49.s58">What you really want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have wronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven."<qe/></s> <s sid="59" id="girls.c49.s59">Hester began to sob wildly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="girls.c49.p26" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="girls.c49.s60"><qs/>"If--if she dies--may I see her first?"<qe/> she gasped.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="girls.c49.p28"><s sid="64" id="girls.c49.s64">Mr Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="girls.c49.p30"><s sid="66" id="girls.c49.s66">He closed the door, and came back to Susan.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="girls.c49.p31"><s sid="67" id="girls.c49.s67">All throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester; but the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very righteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned heavily against the table.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="girls.c49.p32" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="girls.c49.s68"><qs/>"This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss Drummond?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="girls.c49.p33" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="girls.c49.s69"><qs/>"Oh, yes; there seems to be no use in denying that,"<qe/> said Susan.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="girls.c49.p40"><s sid="107" id="girls.c49.s107">Susan Drummond sank down on the nearest seat, and began to cry softly; one or two pin-pricks from Mr Everard's stern words may possibly have reached her shallow heart--no one can tell.</s> <s sid="108" id="girls.c49.s108">She left Lavender House that evening, and none of the girls who had lived with her as their school-mate heard of her again.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="girls.c50.p1"><s sid="1" id="girls.c50.s1">For several days now Annie had lain unconscious in Mrs Williams's little bedroom; the kind-hearted woman could not find it in her heart to send the sick child away.</s> <s sid="2" id="girls.c50.s2">Her husband and the neighbours expostulated with her, and said that Annie was only a poor little waif.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="girls.c50.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="girls.c50.s3"><qs/>"She has no call on you,"<qe/> said Jane Allen, a hard-featured woman who lived next door.</s> <s sid="4" id="girls.c50.s4"><qs/>"Why should you put yourself out just for a sick lass? and she'll be much better on in the workhouse infirmary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="girls.c50.p3"><s sid="5" id="girls.c50.s5">But Mrs Williams shook her head at her hard-featured and hard-hearted neighbour, and resisted her husband's entreaties.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="girls.c50.p5"><s sid="7" id="girls.c50.s7">So Annie stayed, and tossed from side to side of her little bed, and murmured unintelligible words, and grew daily a little weaker and a little more delirious.</s> <s sid="8" id="girls.c50.s8">The parish doctor called, and shook his head over her: he was not a particularly clever man, but he was the best the Williamses could afford.</s> <s sid="9" id="girls.c50.s9">While Annie suffered and went deeper into that valley of humiliation and weakness which leads to the gate of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, little Nan played with Peggy Williams, and accustomed herself after the fashion of little children to all the ways of her new and humble home.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="girls.c50.p6"><s sid="10" id="girls.c50.s10">It was on the eighth day of Annie's fever that the Misses Bruce discovered her, and on the evening of that day Mrs Willis knelt by her little favourite's bed.</s> <s sid="11" id="girls.c50.s11">A better doctor had been called in, and all that money could procure had been got now for poor Annie; but the second doctor considered her case even more critical, and said that the close air of the cottage was much against her recovery.</s> </p>
