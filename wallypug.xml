<p pid="2" id="wallypug.c0.p2"><s>PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wallypug.c0.p3"><s>MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS,</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wallypug.c0.p4"><s>I have again to thank you for the many kind and delightful letters which I have received from all parts of the world, and I cannot tell you how happy I am to find that I have succeeded so well in pleasing you with my stories.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wallypug.c0.p5"><s>What am I to say to the little boy who wrote, and begged "that, if the Wallypug came to stay with me again, would I please invite him too?" or to the other dear little fellow who came to me with tears in his eyes, to tell me that some superior grown-up person had informed him that "there never was a Wallypug, and it was all just a pack of nonsense"; that "Girlie never went to Why at all, and that in fact there was no such place in existence"?</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wallypug.c0.p6"><s>I can only regretfully admit that, sooner or later as we grow up to be men and women, there are bound to be many fond illusions which are one by one ruthlessly dispelled, and that many of the dreams and thoughts which, in our younger days, we cherish most dearly, the hard, matter-of-fact world will always persist in describing as "a pack of nonsense."</s> <s>However, for many of us fortunately, this tiresome time has not yet arrived, and for the present we will refuse to give up our poor dear Wallypug--for whom I declare I have as great an affection and regard, as the most enthusiastic of my young readers.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wallypug.c0.p7"><s>You will see that in the following story I have described my own experiences during a recent visit to the remarkable land over which His Majesty reigns as a "kind of king", and I may tell you that, amongst all of the extraordinary creatures that I met there, there was not one who expressed the slightest doubt as to the reality of what was happening; while for my own part, I should as soon think of doubting the existence of the fairies themselves, as of the simple, kind-hearted, little Wallypug.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wallypug.c0.p8"><s>There now!</s> <s>I hope that I have given quite a clear and lucid explanation, and one which will prevent you from being made unhappy by any doubts which may arise in your mind as to the possibility, or probability, of this story.</s> <s>Please don't forget to write to me again during the coming year.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I. HOW I WENT TO WHY.</title>
<p pid="1" id="wallypug.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="wallypug.c1.s1">FOR some time past I have been the guest of his Majesty the Wallypug at his palace in the mysterious kingdom of Why--a country so remarkable that even now I am only just beginning to get used to my strange surroundings and stranger neighbors.</s> <s sid="2" id="wallypug.c1.s2">Imagine, if you can, a place where all of the animals not only talk, but take an active part in the government of the land, a place where one is as likely as not to receive an invitation to an evening party from an ostrich, or is expected to escort an elderly rhinoceros in to dinner; where it is quite an everyday occurrence to be called upon by a hen with a brood of young chickens just as you are sitting down to tea, and be expected to take a lively interest in her account of how the youngest chick passed through its latest attack of the "pip."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wallypug.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="wallypug.c1.s3">In such a country, the unexpected is always happening, and I am continually being startled in the streets at being addressed by some dangerous-looking quadruped, or an impertinent bird, for I must say that as a class the birds are the most insolent of all the inhabitants of this strange land.</s> <s sid="4" id="wallypug.c1.s4">There is in particular one old crow, a most objectionable personage, and a cockatoo who is really the most violent and ill-natured bird that I have ever been acquainted with.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wallypug.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="wallypug.c1.s5">She takes a very active interest in Parliamentary affairs, and is a strong supporter of woman's wrongs.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wallypug.c1.p4"><s sid="6" id="wallypug.c1.s6">"Every woman has her wrongs," she declares, "and if she hasn't she ought to have."</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wallypug.c1.p5"><s sid="7" id="wallypug.c1.s7">You will naturally wish to know how I reached this strange country, and will, no doubt, be surprised when I tell you how the journey was accomplished.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wallypug.c1.p6"><s sid="8" id="wallypug.c1.s8">One morning a few weeks since, I received a letter from his Majesty the Wallypug asking me to visit him at his palace at Why, in order to assist him in establishing some of our social customs and methods of government, which he had so greatly admired during his visit to England, and which he was desirous of imitating in his own land.</s> <s sid="9" id="wallypug.c1.s9">A little packet was enclosed in the letter, bearing the words, "The shortest way to Why.</s> <s sid="10" id="wallypug.c1.s10">This side up with _anxiety_."</s> <s sid="11" id="wallypug.c1.s11">"Well," I thought, "I suppose they mean 'This side up with _care_,'" and was proceeding very carefully to open the packet when a gust of wind rushed in at the window, and blowing open the paper wrapper, scattered the contents--a little white powder--in all directions.</s> <s sid="12" id="wallypug.c1.s12">Some particles flew up into my eyes, and caused them to smart so violently that I was obliged to close them for some time till the pain had gone, and when I opened them again, what do you think?</s> <s sid="13" id="wallypug.c1.s13">I was no longer in my study at home, but out on a kind of heath in the brilliant sunshine, and apparently miles from a house of any kind.</s> <s sid="14" id="wallypug.c1.s14">A finger-post stood a little way in front of me, and I could see that three roads met just here.</s> <s sid="15" id="wallypug.c1.s15">Anxiously I hurried up to the post to see where I was.</s> <s sid="16" id="wallypug.c1.s16">One arm pointed, "To Nowhere."</s> <s sid="17" id="wallypug.c1.s17">"And I certainly don't want to go there," I thought; the other one was inscribed, "To Somewhere," which was decidedly a little better, but the third one said, "To Everywhere Else."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wallypug.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="wallypug.c1.s18">["THAT'S NOT MUCH USE."]</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wallypug.c1.p8"><s sid="19" id="wallypug.c1.s19">"And, good gracious me," I thought, "that's not much use, for I don't know in the least now which of the last two roads to take."</s> <s sid="20" id="wallypug.c1.s20">I was puzzling my brain as to what was the best thing to be done, when I happened to look down the road leading to "Nowhere," and saw a curious-looking little person running towards me.</s> <s sid="21" id="wallypug.c1.s21">He had an enormous head, and apparently his arms and legs were attached to it, for I could see no trace of a body.</s> <s sid="22" id="wallypug.c1.s22">He was flourishing something in his hand as he ran along, and as soon as he came closer I discovered that it was his card which he handed to me with a polite bow and an extensive smile, as soon as he got near enough to do so.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wallypug.c1.p9"><s sid="23" id="wallypug.c1.s23">"_MR.</s> <s sid="24" id="wallypug.c1.s24">NOBODY,_ _No.</s> <s sid="25" id="wallypug.c1.s25">1 NONESUCH-STREET,_ _NOWHERE,_"</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wallypug.c1.p10"><s sid="26" id="wallypug.c1.s26">is what I read.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wallypug.c1.p11"><s sid="27" id="wallypug.c1.s27">The little man was still smiling and bowing, so I held out my hand and said:</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wallypug.c1.p12"><s sid="28" id="wallypug.c1.s28">"How do you do, sir?</s> <s sid="29" id="wallypug.c1.s29">I am very pleased to make your acquaintance.</s> <s sid="30" id="wallypug.c1.s30">Perhaps you can be good enough to tell me--"</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wallypug.c1.p13"><s sid="31" id="wallypug.c1.s31">The little man nodded violently.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wallypug.c1.p14"><s sid="32" id="wallypug.c1.s32">"To tell me where I am," I continued.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wallypug.c1.p15"><s sid="33" id="wallypug.c1.s33">Mr. Nobody looked very wise, and after a few moments' thought smiled and nodded more violently than ever, and simply pointed his finger at me.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wallypug.c1.p16"><s sid="34" id="wallypug.c1.s34">"Yes, yes," I cried, rather impatiently; "of course I know that I'm here, but what I want to know is, what place is this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wallypug.c1.p17"><s sid="35" id="wallypug.c1.s35">The little fellow knitted his brows, and looked very thoughtful, and finally staring at me sorrowfully, he slowly shook his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wallypug.c1.p18"><s sid="36" id="wallypug.c1.s36">"You don't know?"</s> <s sid="37" id="wallypug.c1.s37">I inquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="wallypug.c1.p19"><s sid="38" id="wallypug.c1.s38">He shook his head again.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wallypug.c1.p20"><s sid="39" id="wallypug.c1.s39">"Dear me, this is very sad; the poor man is evidently dumb," I said, half aloud.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wallypug.c1.p21"><s sid="40" id="wallypug.c1.s40">Mr. Nobody must have heard me, for he nodded violently, then resuming his former smile, he bowed again, and turning on his heels ran back in the direction of Nowhere, stopping every now and then to turn around and nod and smile and wave his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="wallypug.c1.p22"><s sid="41" id="wallypug.c1.s41">"What a remarkable little person," I was just saying, when I heard a voice above my head calling out:</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="wallypug.c1.p23"><s sid="42" id="wallypug.c1.s42">"Man! man!"</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="wallypug.c1.p24"><s sid="43" id="wallypug.c1.s43">I looked up and saw a large crow perched on the finger-post.</s> <s sid="44" id="wallypug.c1.s44">He had a newspaper in one claw, and was gravely regarding me over the tops of his spectacles.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="wallypug.c1.p25"><s sid="45" id="wallypug.c1.s45">"Well! what are you staring at?" he remarked as soon as he caught my eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wallypug.c1.p26"><s sid="46" id="wallypug.c1.s46">"Well, really," I began.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="wallypug.c1.p27"><s sid="47" id="wallypug.c1.s47">"Haven't you ever seen a crow before?" he interrupted.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="wallypug.c1.p28"><s sid="48" id="wallypug.c1.s48">"Of course I have," I answered rather angrily, for my surprise at hearing him talk was fast giving way to indignation at his insolent tone and manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="wallypug.c1.p29"><s sid="49" id="wallypug.c1.s49">"Very well, then, what do you want to stand there gaping at me in that absurd way for?" said the bird.</s> <s sid="50" id="wallypug.c1.s50">"What did he say to you?" he continued, jerking his head in the direction in which Mr. Nobody had disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="wallypug.c1.p30"><s sid="51" id="wallypug.c1.s51">"Nothing," I replied.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="wallypug.c1.p31"><s sid="52" id="wallypug.c1.s52">"Very well, then, what was it?" he asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="wallypug.c1.p32"><s sid="53" id="wallypug.c1.s53">"What do you mean?" said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="wallypug.c1.p33"><s sid="54" id="wallypug.c1.s54">"Why, stupid, you said Nobody and nothing, didn't you, and as two negatives make an affirmative that means he must have said something."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="wallypug.c1.p34"><s sid="55" id="wallypug.c1.s55">"I'm afraid I don't quite understand," I said.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="wallypug.c1.p35"><s sid="56" id="wallypug.c1.s56">"Ignorant ostrich!" remarked the crow contemptuously.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="wallypug.c1.p36"><s sid="57" id="wallypug.c1.s57">"Look here," I cried, getting very indignant, "I will not be spoken to like that by a mere bird!"</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="wallypug.c1.p37"><s sid="58" id="wallypug.c1.s58">"Oh, really!</s> <s sid="59" id="wallypug.c1.s59">Who do you think you are, pray, you ridiculous biped?</s> <s sid="60" id="wallypug.c1.s60">Where's your hat?"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="wallypug.c1.p38"><s sid="61" id="wallypug.c1.s61">I was too indignant to answer, and though I should have liked to have asked the name of the place I was at, I determined not to hold any further conversation with the insolent bird, and walked away in the direction of "Somewhere," pursued by the sound of mocking laughter from the crow.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="wallypug.c1.p39"><s sid="62" id="wallypug.c1.s62">["WHERE'S YOUR HAT?"]</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="wallypug.c1.p40"><s sid="63" id="wallypug.c1.s63">I had not gone far, however, before I perceived a curious kind of carriage coming towards me.</s> <s sid="64" id="wallypug.c1.s64">It was a sort of rickshaw, and was drawn by a kangaroo, who was jerking it along behind him.</s> <s sid="65" id="wallypug.c1.s65">A large ape sat inside, hugging a carpet bag, and holding on to the dashboard with his toes.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="wallypug.c1.p41"><s sid="66" id="wallypug.c1.s66">"Let's pass him with withering contempt," I heard one of them say.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="wallypug.c1.p42"><s sid="67" id="wallypug.c1.s67">"All right," was the reply.</s> <s sid="68" id="wallypug.c1.s68">"Drive on."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="wallypug.c1.p43"><s sid="69" id="wallypug.c1.s69">"I say, Man," called out the Ape, as they passed, "we're not taking the slightest notice of you."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="wallypug.c1.p44"><s sid="70" id="wallypug.c1.s70">"Oh, aren't you?</s> <s sid="71" id="wallypug.c1.s71">Well, I'm sure I don't care," I replied rather crossly.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="wallypug.c1.p45"><s sid="72" id="wallypug.c1.s72">The Kangaroo stopped and stared at me in amazement, and the Ape got out of the rickshaw and came towards me, looking very indignant.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="wallypug.c1.p46"><s sid="73" id="wallypug.c1.s73">"Do you know who I am?" he asked, striking an attitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="wallypug.c1.p47"><s sid="74" id="wallypug.c1.s74">"No, I don't," I replied, "and what's more, I don't care."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="wallypug.c1.p48"><s sid="75" id="wallypug.c1.s75">"But I'm a person of consequence," he gasped.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="wallypug.c1.p49"><s sid="76" id="wallypug.c1.s76">"You are only an ape or a monkey," I said firmly.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="wallypug.c1.p51"><s sid="80" id="wallypug.c1.s80">"Indeed," I said unconcernedly.</s> <s sid="81" id="wallypug.c1.s81">"I am afraid I've never heard of you."</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="wallypug.c1.p52"><s sid="82" id="wallypug.c1.s82">"Never heard of Oom Hi," cried the Ape.</s> <s sid="83" id="wallypug.c1.s83">"Why, I am the inventor of Broncho."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="wallypug.c1.p54" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="wallypug.c1.s87">"This," continued Oom Hi, taking out a bottle, "is the article; it is called <qs/>'Broncho,'<qe/> and is excellent for coughs, colds, and affections of the throat; you will notice that each bottle bears a label stating that the mixture is prepared according to my own formula, and bears my signature; none other is genuine without it.</s> <s sid="88" id="wallypug.c1.s88">The Wallypug, when he returned from England and heard that I had invented it, declared that I must be a literary genius."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="wallypug.c1.p57"><s sid="93" id="wallypug.c1.s93">"A literary genius," repeated the Ape, smirking complacently.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="wallypug.c1.p59"><s sid="96" id="wallypug.c1.s96">"I don't know, I'm sure," admitted Oom Hi, "but the Wallypug said that in England any one who invented anything of that sort was supposed to possess great literary talent."</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="wallypug.c16.p93"><s sid="206" id="wallypug.c16.s206">"Is it a very large forest, Uncle?" said Olive.</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="wallypug.c16.p94"><s sid="207" id="wallypug.c16.s207">"Yes, very large," he replied rather sleepily, to tell the truth: for both he and Auntie had been nodding a little, and Rex had once or twice been fairly asleep.</s> <s sid="208" id="wallypug.c16.s208">But Olive's imagination was far too hard at work to let her sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="96" id="wallypug.c16.p96"><s sid="210" id="wallypug.c16.s210">"Oh yes, by far," he replied, for he had not heard clearly what she said, and fancied it was "the largest hereabouts."</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="wallypug.c16.p97"><s sid="211" id="wallypug.c16.s211">"Dear me!" thought Olive, looking round her with awe and satisfaction.</s> <s sid="212" id="wallypug.c16.s212">"If there are dwarfs anywhere, then it must be here."</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="wallypug.c16.p98"><s sid="213" id="wallypug.c16.s213">And she was just beginning another.</s> <s sid="214" id="wallypug.c16.s214">"And please, Uncle, is----?" when her aunt looked up and said lazily--</s> </p>

<p pid="100" id="wallypug.c16.p100"><s sid="219" id="wallypug.c16.s219">Auntie was a truer prophet than she knew; for when they got to the little hamlet in the wood, where they were to rest, something proved to be wrong with one of the horse's shoes; _so_ wrong, indeed, that after a prolonged examination, at which all the inhabitants turned out to assist, it was decided that the horse must be re-shod before he could go any farther; and this made it impossible for the party who had come in the carriage to go any farther either.</s> <s sid="220" id="wallypug.c16.s220">For the nearest smithy was two miles off; the horse must be led there and back by the driver, which would take at least two, if not three, hours.</s> <s sid="221" id="wallypug.c16.s221">It was now past six, and they had come barely half way.</s> <s sid="222" id="wallypug.c16.s222">The driver shook his head, and said he would not like to go on to the town till morning.</s> <s sid="223" id="wallypug.c16.s223">The horse had pricked his foot; it might cause inflammation to drive him farther without a rest, and the carriage was far too heavy for the other horse alone, which had suddenly struck the children's uncle as a brilliant idea.</s> </p>

<p pid="101" id="wallypug.c16.p101"><s sid="224" id="wallypug.c16.s224">"There would be no difficulty about the harnessing, any way," he said to Auntie, laughing; "for all the vehicles hereabouts drawn by one horse have the animal at one side of a pole, instead of between shafts."</s> </p>

<p pid="102" id="wallypug.c16.p102"><s sid="225" id="wallypug.c16.s225">But Auntie thought it better to give in.</s> </p>

<p pid="103" id="wallypug.c16.p103"><s sid="226" id="wallypug.c16.s226">"It really doesn't much matter," she said; "we can stay here well enough.</s> <s sid="227" id="wallypug.c16.s227">There are two bedrooms, and no doubt they can give us something to eat; beer and sausages, and brown bread any way."</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="wallypug.c16.p104"><s sid="228" id="wallypug.c16.s228">And so it was settled greatly to Olive's satisfaction; it would give her capital opportunities for a dwarf hunt! though as to this she kept her own counsel.</s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="wallypug.c16.p105"><s sid="229" id="wallypug.c16.s229">The landlady of the little post-house where they had stopped was accustomed to occasional visits of this kind from benighted or distressed travelers.</s> <s sid="230" id="wallypug.c16.s230">She thought nothing of turning her two daughters out of their bedroom, which, it must be owned, was very clean, for Auntie and Olive, and a second room on the ground-floor was prepared for Rex and his uncle.</s> <s sid="231" id="wallypug.c16.s231">She had coffee ready in five minutes, and promised them a comfortable supper before bedtime.</s> <s sid="232" id="wallypug.c16.s232">Altogether, everything seemed very satisfactory, and when they felt a little refreshed, Auntie proposed a walk--"a good long walk," she said, "would do us good.</s> <s sid="233" id="wallypug.c16.s233">And the landlady says we get out of the forest up there behind the house, where the ground rises, and that there is a lovely view.</s> <s sid="234" id="wallypug.c16.s234">It will be rather a climb, but it isn't more than three quarters of an hour from here, and we have not walked all day."</s> </p>

<p pid="106" id="wallypug.c16.p106"><s sid="235" id="wallypug.c16.s235">Uncle thought it a good idea, and Rex was ready to start at once; but Olive looked less pleased.</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="wallypug.c16.p107"><s sid="236" id="wallypug.c16.s236">"Don't you want to come, Olive?" said Auntie.</s> <s sid="237" id="wallypug.c16.s237">"Are you tired?</s> <s sid="238" id="wallypug.c16.s238">You didn't take a nap like the rest of us."</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="wallypug.c16.p108"><s sid="239" id="wallypug.c16.s239">"I am a little tired," said Olive, which was true in one sense, though not in another, for she was quite fit for a walk.</s> <s sid="240" id="wallypug.c16.s240">It struck her that her excuse was not quite an honest one, so she added, "If you don't mind, I would rather stay about here.</s> <s sid="241" id="wallypug.c16.s241">I don't mind being alone, and I have my book.</s> <s sid="242" id="wallypug.c16.s242">And I do so like the forest."</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="wallypug.c16.p109"><s sid="243" id="wallypug.c16.s243">"Very well," said her uncle; "only don't lose yourself.</s> <s sid="244" id="wallypug.c16.s244">She is perfectly safe," he added, turning to her aunt; "there are neither wolves, nor bears, nor robbers nowadays, in these peaceful forests."</s> </p>

<p pid="110" id="wallypug.c16.p110"><s sid="245" id="wallypug.c16.s245">So the three set off, leaving Olive to her own devices.</s> <s sid="246" id="wallypug.c16.s246">She waited till they were out of sight, then she made her preparations.</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="wallypug.c16.p111"><s sid="247" id="wallypug.c16.s247">"I'd better take my purse," she said to herself, "in case I meet the dwarfs.</s> <s sid="248" id="wallypug.c16.s248">Auntie told me to be very polite, and perhaps they would like some of these tiny pieces; they just look as if they were meant for them."</s> <s sid="249" id="wallypug.c16.s249">So she chose out a few one-pfennig copper coins, which are much smaller than our farthings, and one or two silver pieces, worth about twopence-halfpenny each, still smaller.</s> <s sid="250" id="wallypug.c16.s250">Then she put in her pocket half a slice of the brown bread they had had with their coffee, and arming herself, more for appearance'-sake than anything else, with her parasol and the book she had with her in her traveling bag, she set off on her solitary ramble.</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="wallypug.c16.p112"><s sid="251" id="wallypug.c16.s251">It was still hot--though the forest trees made a pleasant shade.</s> <s sid="252" id="wallypug.c16.s252">Olive walked some way, farther and farther, as far as she could make out, into the heart of the forest, but in her inexperience she took no sort of care to notice the way she went, or to make for herself any kind of landmarks.</s> <s sid="253" id="wallypug.c16.s253">She just wandered on and on, tempted first by some mysterious little path, and then by another, her mind full of the idea of the discoveries she was perhaps about to make.</s> <s sid="254" id="wallypug.c16.s254">Now and then a squirrel darted across from one tree to another, disappearing among the branches almost before Olive could be sure she had seen it, or some wild wood birds, less familiar to the little foreigner, would startle her with a shrill, strange note.</s> <s sid="255" id="wallypug.c16.s255">There were here and there lovely flowers growing among the moss, and more than once she heard the sound of not far off trickling water.</s> <s sid="256" id="wallypug.c16.s256">It was all strangely beautiful, and she would greatly have enjoyed and admired it had not her mind been so full of the queer fascinating idea of the blue dwarfs.</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="wallypug.c16.p113"><s sid="257" id="wallypug.c16.s257">At last--she had wandered about for some time--Olive began to feel tired.</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="wallypug.c16.p114"><s sid="258" id="wallypug.c16.s258">"I may as well sit down a little," she thought; "I have lots of time to get back.</s> <s sid="259" id="wallypug.c16.s259">This seems the very heart of the forest.</s> <s sid="260" id="wallypug.c16.s260">They are just as likely to be seen here as anywhere else."</s> </p>

<p pid="115" id="wallypug.c16.p115"><s sid="261" id="wallypug.c16.s261">So Olive ensconced herself in a comfortable corner, her back against the root of a tree, which seemed hollowed out on purpose to serve as an armchair.</s> <s sid="262" id="wallypug.c16.s262">She thought at first she would read a little, but the light was already slightly waning, and the tree shadows made it still fainter.</s> <s sid="263" id="wallypug.c16.s263">Besides, Olive had plenty to think of--she did not require any amusement.</s> <s sid="264" id="wallypug.c16.s264">Queer little noises now and then made themselves heard--once or twice it really sounded as if small feet were pattering along, or as if shrill little voices were laughing in the distance; and with each sound, Olive's heart beat faster with excitement--not with fear.</s> </p>

<p pid="116" id="wallypug.c16.p116"><s sid="265" id="wallypug.c16.s265">"If I sit very still," she thought, "who knows what I may see?</s> <s sid="266" id="wallypug.c16.s266">Of course, it would be much nicer and prettier if the dwarfs were quite tiny--not like the little man we saw in the street at that place--I forget the name--for he was not pretty at all--but like the blue dwarfs at the manufactory.</s> <s sid="267" id="wallypug.c16.s267">But that, I suppose, is impossible, for they would be really like fairies.</s> <s sid="268" id="wallypug.c16.s268">But they might be something between: not so big as the little man, and yet bigger than the blue dwarfs."</s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="wallypug.c16.p117"><s sid="269" id="wallypug.c16.s269">And then Olive grew a little confused in trying to settle in her mind how big, or how small rather, it was possible or impossible for a nation of dwarfs to be.</s> <s sid="270" id="wallypug.c16.s270">She thought it over till she hardly seemed sure what she was trying to decide.</s> <s sid="271" id="wallypug.c16.s271">She kept saying to herself, "Any way, they could not but be a good deal bigger than my thumb!</s> <s sid="272" id="wallypug.c16.s272">What does that mean?</s> <s sid="273" id="wallypug.c16.s273">Perhaps it means more in German measures than in English, perhaps----"</s> </p>

<p pid="119" id="wallypug.c16.p119"><s sid="279" id="wallypug.c16.s279">"It has a very roasty smell," thought Olive; "where can it have come from?"</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="wallypug.c16.p120"><s sid="280" id="wallypug.c16.s280">And hardly had she asked herself the question, when a sudden noise all round her made her again look up.</s> <s sid="281" id="wallypug.c16.s281">They were sliding down the branches of the tree in all directions.</s> <s sid="282" id="wallypug.c16.s282">At first, to her dazzled eyes, they seemed a whole army, but as they touched the ground one by one, and she was able to distinguish them better, she saw that after all there were not so _very_ many.</s> <s sid="283" id="wallypug.c16.s283">One, two, three, she began quickly counting to herself, not aloud, of course--that would not have been polite--one, two, three, up to twelve, then thirteen, fourteen and so on up to--yes, there were just twenty-four of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="wallypug.c16.p121"><s sid="284" id="wallypug.c16.s284">"Two of each," said Olive to herself; "a double set of the blue dwarfs."</s> </p>

<p pid="141" id="wallypug.c16.p141"><s sid="325" id="wallypug.c16.s325">"But you called us 'blue,'" said the second; and it really was a relief to hear him finish a sentence comfortably by himself, only Olive felt very puzzled by what he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="143" id="wallypug.c16.p143"><s sid="330" id="wallypug.c16.s330">"How very amusing!" said the dwarfs, this time again speaking together.</s> </p>

<p pid="144" id="wallypug.c16.p144"><s sid="331" id="wallypug.c16.s331">Olive could not see that it was very amusing, but she was afraid of saying so, for fear it should be rude.</s> </p>

<p pid="146" id="wallypug.c16.p146"><s sid="336" id="wallypug.c16.s336">Olive felt more and more uncomfortable.</s> </p>

<p pid="148" id="wallypug.c16.p148"><s sid="342" id="wallypug.c16.s342">The two dwarfs came close and examined the piece of bread with the greatest attention.</s> <s sid="343" id="wallypug.c16.s343">They pinched and smelt it, and one of them put out his queer little pointed tongue and licked it.</s> </p>

<p pid="149" id="wallypug.c16.p149"><s sid="344" id="wallypug.c16.s344">"Not good!" he said, looking up at Olive and rolling about his eyes in a very queer way.</s> </p>

<p pid="150" id="wallypug.c16.p150"><s sid="345" id="wallypug.c16.s345">"I don't know," said Olive; "I don't think it can be bad.</s> <s sid="346" id="wallypug.c16.s346">It is the regular bread of the country.</s> <s sid="347" id="wallypug.c16.s347">I should have thought you would be accustomed to it, as you live here."</s> </p>

<p pid="151" id="wallypug.c16.p151"><s sid="348" id="wallypug.c16.s348">The two dwarfs took no notice of what she said, but suddenly turned round, and standing with their backs to Olive called out shrilly, "Gueton Tag."</s> <s sid="349" id="wallypug.c16.s349">Immediately all the other dwarfs replied in the same tone and the same words, and to Olive's great surprise they all began to move towards her, but without altering their attitudes--those on the barrel rolled towards her without getting off it; the two who were hugging their knees continued to hug them, while they came on by means of jerking themselves; the turning head-over-heels ones span along like wheels, and so on till the whole assemblage were at her feet.</s> <s sid="350" id="wallypug.c16.s350">Then she saw unfolded before her, hanging on the branches of the tree, a large mantle, just the shape of her aunt's travelling dust-cloak, which she always spread over Olive in a carriage, only, instead of being drab or fawn-colored, it was, like the dwarfs' jackets, bright blue.</s> <s sid="351" id="wallypug.c16.s351">And without any one telling her, Olive seemed to know of herself that she was to put it on.</s> </p>

<p pid="152" id="wallypug.c16.p152"><s sid="352" id="wallypug.c16.s352">She got up and reached the cloak easily; it seemed to put itself on, and Olive felt very happy and triumphant as she said to herself, "Now I'm really going to have some adventures."</s> </p>

<p pid="153" id="wallypug.c16.p153"><s sid="353" id="wallypug.c16.s353">The dwarfs marched--no! one cannot call it marching, for they had about a dozen different ways of proceeding--they moved on, and Olive in the middle, her blue cloak floating majestically on her shoulders.</s> <s sid="354" id="wallypug.c16.s354">No one spoke a word.</s> <s sid="355" id="wallypug.c16.s355">It grew darker and darker among the trees, but Olive did not feel frightened.</s> <s sid="356" id="wallypug.c16.s356">On they went, till at last she saw twinkling before them a very small but bright blue light.</s> <s sid="357" id="wallypug.c16.s357">It looked scarcely larger than the lamp of a glow-worm, but it shone out very distinct in the darkness.</s> <s sid="358" id="wallypug.c16.s358">Immediately they saw it the dwarfs set up a shout, and as it died away, to Olive's surprise, they began to sing.</s> <s sid="359" id="wallypug.c16.s359">And what do you think they sang?</s> <s sid="360" id="wallypug.c16.s360">Olive at first could hardly believe her ears as they listened to the thoroughly English song of "Home, sweet Home."</s> <s sid="361" id="wallypug.c16.s361">And the queerest thing was that they sang it very prettily, and that it sounded exactly like her aunt's voice!</s> <s sid="362" id="wallypug.c16.s362">And though they were walking close beside her, their voices when they left off singing did not so much seem to stop as to move off, to die away into the distance, which struck Olive as very odd.</s> </p>

<p pid="154" id="wallypug.c16.p154"><s sid="363" id="wallypug.c16.s363">They had now arrived at the trunk of a large tree, half way up which hung the little lamp--at least Olive supposed it must be a lamp--from which came the bright blue light.</s> </p>

<p pid="155" id="wallypug.c16.p155"><s sid="364" id="wallypug.c16.s364">"Here we are," said one of the dwarfs, she did not see which, "at the entrance to our village."</s> <s sid="365" id="wallypug.c16.s365">And thereupon all the dwarfs began climbing up the tree, swarming about it like a hive of bees, till they got some way up, when one after another they suddenly disappeared.</s> <s sid="366" id="wallypug.c16.s366">Olive could see all they did by the blue light.</s> <s sid="367" id="wallypug.c16.s367">She was beginning to wonder if she would be left standing there alone, when a shout made her look up, and she saw two dwarfs standing on a branch holding a rope ladder, which they had just thrown down, and making signs to her to mount up by it.</s> <s sid="368" id="wallypug.c16.s368">It was quite easy; up went Olive, step by step, and when she reached the place where the two dwarfs were standing, she saw how it was that they had all disappeared.</s> <s sid="369" id="wallypug.c16.s369">The tree trunk was hollow, and there were steps cut in it like a stair, down which the dwarfs signed to her that she was to go.</s> <s sid="370" id="wallypug.c16.s370">She did not need to be twice told, so eager was she to see what was to come.</s> <s sid="371" id="wallypug.c16.s371">The stair was rather difficult for her to get down without falling, for the steps were too small, being intended for the dwarfs, but Olive managed pretty well, only slipping now and then.</s> <s sid="372" id="wallypug.c16.s372">The stair seemed very long, and as she went farther it grew darker, till at last it was quite dark; by which time, fortunately, however, she felt herself again on level ground, and after waiting half a minute a door seemed to open, and she found herself standing outside the tree stair, with the prettiest sight before her eyes that she had ever seen or even imagined.</s> </p>

<p pid="156" id="wallypug.c16.p156"><s sid="373" id="wallypug.c16.s373">It was the dwarf village!</s> <s sid="374" id="wallypug.c16.s374">Rows and rows of tiny houses--none of them more than about twice as high as Olive herself, for that was quite big enough for a dwarf cottage, each with a sweet little garden in front, like what one sees in English villages, though the houses themselves were like Swiss chalets.</s> <s sid="375" id="wallypug.c16.s375">It was not dark down here, there was a soft light about as bright as we have it at summer twilight; and besides this each little house had a twinkling blue light hanging above the front door, like a sign-post.</s> <s sid="376" id="wallypug.c16.s376">And at the door of each cottage stood one of the dwarfs, with a little dwarf wife beside him; only, instead of blue, each little woman was dressed in brown, so that they were rather less showy than their husbands.</s> <s sid="377" id="wallypug.c16.s377">They all began bowing as Olive appeared, and all the little women curtseying, and Olive seemed to understand, without being told, that she was to walk up the village street to see all there was to be seen.</s> <s sid="378" id="wallypug.c16.s378">So on she marched, her blue cloak floating about her, so that sometimes it reached the roofs of the houses on each side at the same time.</s> </p>

<p pid="157" id="wallypug.c16.p157"><s sid="379" id="wallypug.c16.s379">Olive felt herself rather clumsy.</s> <s sid="380" id="wallypug.c16.s380">Her feet, which in general she was accustomed to consider rather neat, and by no means too large for her age, seemed such great awkward things.</s> <s sid="381" id="wallypug.c16.s381">If she had put one of them in at the window of a dwarf house, it would have knocked everything out of its place.</s> </p>

<p pid="158" id="wallypug.c16.p158"><s sid="382" id="wallypug.c16.s382">"Dear me!" thought Olive, "I had no idea _I_ could seem clumsy!</s> <s sid="383" id="wallypug.c16.s383">I feel like a great plowman.</s> <s sid="384" id="wallypug.c16.s384">I wish I were not so big."</s> </p>

<p pid="159" id="wallypug.c16.p159"><s sid="385" id="wallypug.c16.s385">"Yes," said a voice beside her, "it has its disadvantages;" and Olive, looking down to see who spoke--she had to look down for everything--caught sight of one of the two dwarfs with whom she had first spoken.</s> <s sid="386" id="wallypug.c16.s386">She felt a little ruffled.</s> <s sid="387" id="wallypug.c16.s387">She did not like this trick of the dwarf hearing what she thought before she said it.</s> </p>

<p pid="160" id="wallypug.c16.p160"><s sid="388" id="wallypug.c16.s388">"Everything has its disadvantages," she replied.</s> <s sid="389" id="wallypug.c16.s389">"Don't you find yourself very inconveniently small when you are up in _our_ world?"</s> </p>

<p pid="161" id="wallypug.c16.p161"><s sid="390" id="wallypug.c16.s390">"Exactly so," said the dwarf; but he did not seem the least put out.</s> </p>

<p pid="162" id="wallypug.c16.p162"><s sid="391" id="wallypug.c16.s391">"They are certainly very good-tempered," said Olive to herself.</s> <s sid="392" id="wallypug.c16.s392">Then suddenly a thought struck her.</s> </p>

<p pid="163" id="wallypug.c16.p163"><s sid="393" id="wallypug.c16.s393">"Your village is very neat and pretty," she said; "though, perhaps--I don't mean to be rude, not on any account----"</s> </p>

<p pid="164" id="wallypug.c16.p164"><s sid="394" id="wallypug.c16.s394">"No," interrupted the dwarf; "Auntie told you on no account to be rude."</s> </p>

<p pid="165" id="wallypug.c16.p165"><s sid="395" id="wallypug.c16.s395">"Auntie!" repeated Olive, in astonishment; "she is not _your_ auntie!"</s> </p>

<p pid="166" id="wallypug.c16.p166"><s sid="396" id="wallypug.c16.s396">"On no account," said the dwarf, in the same calm tone, but without seeming to take in that Olive meant to reprove him.</s> </p>

<p pid="167" id="wallypug.c16.p167"><s sid="397" id="wallypug.c16.s397">"It's no use trying to make them understand," said Olive to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="168" id="wallypug.c16.p168"><s sid="398" id="wallypug.c16.s398">"Not the least," said the dwarf; at which Olive felt so provoked that she could have stamped her feet with irritation.</s> <s sid="399" id="wallypug.c16.s399">But as _thinking_ crossly seemed in this country to be quite as bad as _speaking_ crossly, she had to try to swallow down her vexation as well as she could.</s> </p>

<p pid="169" id="wallypug.c16.p169"><s sid="400" id="wallypug.c16.s400">"I was going to say," she went on quietly, "that to my taste the village would be prettier if there was a little variety.</s> <s sid="401" id="wallypug.c16.s401">Not all the houses just the same, you know.</s> <s sid="402" id="wallypug.c16.s402">And all of _you_ are so like each other, and all your little brown wives too.</s> <s sid="403" id="wallypug.c16.s403">Are there no _children_ dwarfs?"</s> </p>

<p pid="171" id="wallypug.c16.p171"><s sid="406" id="wallypug.c16.s406">"Then where are they all?" said Olive.</s> <s sid="407" id="wallypug.c16.s407">"Are they all asleep?"</s> <s sid="408" id="wallypug.c16.s408">She put the last question rather sarcastically, but the sarcasm seemed to be lost on the little man.</s> </p>

<p pid="172" id="wallypug.c16.p172"><s sid="409" id="wallypug.c16.s409">"Yes, all asleep," he replied; "all asleep, and dreaming.</s> <s sid="410" id="wallypug.c16.s410">Children are very fond of dreaming," he went on, looking up at Olive with such a queer expression, and such a queer tone in his voice too, that Olive got a queer feeling herself, as if he meant more than his words actually said.</s> <s sid="411" id="wallypug.c16.s411">Could he mean to hint that _she_ was dreaming?</s> <s sid="412" id="wallypug.c16.s412">But a remark from the dwarf distracted her thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="173" id="wallypug.c16.p173"><s sid="413" id="wallypug.c16.s413">"Supper is ready," he said.</s> <s sid="414" id="wallypug.c16.s414">"They are all waiting."</s> <s sid="415" id="wallypug.c16.s415">And turning round, Olive saw before her a cottage a good deal larger than the others; in fact, it was almost high enough for her, with considerable stooping, to get in at the door.</s> <s sid="416" id="wallypug.c16.s416">And through the windows she saw a long table neatly covered with a bright blue table-cloth, and spread with numbers of tiny plates, and beside each plate a knife and fork and a little blue glass cup.</s> <s sid="417" id="wallypug.c16.s417">Two great dishes stood on the table, one at each end.</s> <s sid="418" id="wallypug.c16.s418">Steam was rising from each, and a delicious smell came out through the open windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="176" id="wallypug.c16.p176"><s sid="421" id="wallypug.c16.s421">Then he gave a sort of sharp, sudden cry or whistle, and immediately all the dwarfs of the village appeared as if by magic, and began hurrying into the house, but as soon as they were in the middle of the passage they fell back at each side, leaving a clear space in the middle.</s> </p>

<p pid="177" id="wallypug.c16.p177"><s sid="422" id="wallypug.c16.s422">"For you," said the first dwarf, bowing politely.</s> </p>

<p pid="178" id="wallypug.c16.p178"><s sid="423" id="wallypug.c16.s423">"Do you always have supper here altogether like that?" said Olive.</s> <s sid="424" id="wallypug.c16.s424">"How funny!"</s> </p>
