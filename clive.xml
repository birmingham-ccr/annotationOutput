<p pid="1" id="clive.c0.p1"><s>PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="clive.c0.p2"><s>In the following pages I have endeavoured to give a vivid picture of the wonderful events of the ten years, which at their commencement saw Madras in the hands of the French--Calcutta at the mercy of the Nabob of Bengal--and English influence apparently at the point of extinction in India--and which ended in the final triumph of the English, both in Bengal and Madras.</s> <s>There were yet great battles to be fought, great efforts to be made, before the vast Empire of India fell altogether into British hands; but these were but the sequel of the events I have described.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="clive.c0.p3" type="speech"><s>The historical details are, throughout the story, strictly accurate, and for them I am indebted to the history of these events written by Mr. Orme, who lived at that time, to the <qs/>"Life of Lord Clive,"<qe/> recently published by Lieutenant Colonel Malleson, and to other standard authorities.</s> <s>In this book I have devoted a somewhat smaller space to the personal adventures of my hero than in my other historical tales, but the events themselves were of such a thrilling and exciting nature that no fiction could surpass them.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="clive.c0.p4"><s>A word as to the orthography of the names and places.</s> <s>An entirely new method of spelling Indian words has lately been invented by the Indian authorities.</s> <s>This is no doubt more correct than the rough-and-ready orthography of the early traders, and I have therefore adopted it for all little-known places.</s> <s>But there are Indian names which have become household words in England, and should never be changed; and as it would be considered a gross piece of pedantry and affectation on the part of a tourist on the Continent, who should, on his return, say he had been to Genova, Firenze, and Wien, instead of Genoa, Florence, and Vienna; it is, I consider, an even worse offence to transform Arcot, Cawnpoor, and Lucknow, into Arkat, Kahnpur, and Laknao.</s> <s>I have tried, therefore, so far as possible, to give the names of well-known personages and places in the spelling familiar to Englishmen, while the new orthography has been elsewhere adopted.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 1. Leaving Home.</title>
<p pid="1" id="clive.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="clive.c1.s1">A lady in deep mourning was sitting, crying bitterly, by a fire in small lodgings in the town of Yarmouth.</s> <s sid="2" id="clive.c1.s2">Beside her stood a tall lad of sixteen.</s> <s sid="3" id="clive.c1.s3">He was slight in build, but his schoolfellows knew that Charlie Marryat's muscles were as firm and hard as those of any boy in the school.</s> <s sid="4" id="clive.c1.s4">In all sports requiring activity and endurance, rather than weight and strength, he was always conspicuous.</s> <s sid="5" id="clive.c1.s5">Not one in the school could compete with him in long-distance running, and when he was one of the hares there was but little chance for the hounds.</s> <s sid="6" id="clive.c1.s6">He was a capital swimmer, and one of the best boxers in the school.</s> <s sid="7" id="clive.c1.s7">He had a reputation for being a leader in every mischievous prank; but he was honorable and manly, would scorn to shelter himself under the semblance of a lie, and was a prime favourite with his masters, as well as his schoolfellows.</s> <s sid="8" id="clive.c1.s8">His mother bewailed the frequency with which he returned home with blackened eyes and bruised face; for between Dr. Willet's school and the fisher lads of Yarmouth there was a standing feud, whose origin dated so far back that none of those now at school could trace it.</s> <s sid="9" id="clive.c1.s9">Consequently, fierce fights often took place in the narrow rows, and sometimes the fisher boys would be driven back on to the broad quay shaded by trees, by the river, and there being reinforced from the craft along the side, would reassume the offensive and drive their opponents back into the main street.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="clive.c1.p2"><s sid="10" id="clive.c1.s10">It was but six months since Charlie had lost his father, who was the officer in command at the coast guard station, and his scanty pension was now all that remained for the support of his widow and children.</s> <s sid="11" id="clive.c1.s11">His mother had talked his future prospects over, many times, with Charlie.</s> <s sid="12" id="clive.c1.s12">The latter was willing to do anything, but could suggest nothing.</s> <s sid="13" id="clive.c1.s13">His father had but little naval interest, and had for years been employed on coast guard service.</s> <s sid="14" id="clive.c1.s14">Charlie agreed that, although he should have liked of all things to go to sea, it was useless to think of it now, for he was past the age at which he could have entered as a midshipman.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="clive.c1.p3"><s sid="15" id="clive.c1.s15">The matter had been talked over four years before, with his father; but the latter had pointed out that a life in the navy, without interest, is in most cases a very hard one.</s> <s sid="16" id="clive.c1.s16">If a chance of distinguishing himself happened, promotion would follow; but if not, he might be for years on shore, starving on half pay and waiting in vain for an appointment, while officers with more luck and better interest went over his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="clive.c1.p4"><s sid="17" id="clive.c1.s17">Other professions had been discussed, but nothing determined upon, when Lieutenant Marryat suddenly died.</s> <s sid="18" id="clive.c1.s18">Charlie, although an only son, was not an only child, as he had two sisters both younger than himself.</s> <s sid="19" id="clive.c1.s19">After a few months of effort, Mrs. Marryat found that the utmost she could hope to do, with her scanty income, was to maintain herself and daughters, and to educate them until they should reach an age when they could earn their own living as governesses; but that Charlie's keep and education were beyond her resources.</s> <s sid="20" id="clive.c1.s20">She had, therefore, very reluctantly written to an uncle, whom she had not seen for many years, her family having objected very strongly to her marriage with a penniless lieutenant in the navy.</s> <s sid="21" id="clive.c1.s21">She informed him of the loss of her husband, and that, although her income was sufficient to maintain herself and her daughters, she was most anxious to start her son, who was now sixteen, in life; and therefore begged him to use his influence to obtain for him a situation of some sort.</s> <s sid="22" id="clive.c1.s22">The letter which she now held in her hand was the answer to the appeal.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="clive.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="clive.c1.s23"><qs/>"My dear Niece,"<qe/> it began, "Since you, by your own foolish conduct and opposition to all our wishes, separated yourself from your family, and went your own way in life, I have heard little of you, as the death of your parents so shortly afterwards deprived me of all sources of information.</s> <s sid="24" id="clive.c1.s24">I regret to hear of the loss which you have suffered.</s> <s sid="25" id="clive.c1.s25">I have already taken the necessary steps to carry out your wishes.</s> <s sid="26" id="clive.c1.s26">I yesterday dined with a friend, who is one of the directors of the Honorable East India Company, and at my request he has kindly placed a writership in the Company at your son's service.</s> <s sid="27" id="clive.c1.s27">He will have to come up to London to see the board, next week, and will probably have to embark for India a fortnight later.</s> <s sid="28" id="clive.c1.s28">I shall be glad if he will take up his abode with me, during the intervening time.</s> <s sid="29" id="clive.c1.s29">I shall be glad also if you will favour me with a statement of your income and expenses, with such details as you may think necessary.</s> <s sid="30" id="clive.c1.s30">I inclose four five-pound bank notes, in order that your son may obtain such garments as may be immediately needful for his appearance before the board of directors, and for his journey to London.</s> <s sid="31" id="clive.c1.s31">I remain, my dear niece, yours sincerely,</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="clive.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="clive.c1.s33"><qs/>"It is cruel,"<qe/><sss/> Mrs. Marryat sobbed, <sse/><qs/>"cruel to take you away from us, and send you to India, where you will most likely die of fever, or be killed by a tiger, or stabbed by one of those horrid natives, in a fortnight."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="clive.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="clive.c1.s34"><qs/>"Not so bad as that, Mother, I hope,"<qe/><sls/> Charlie said sympathizingly, although he could not repress a smile; <sle/><qs/>"other people have managed to live out there, and have come back safe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="clive.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="clive.c1.s35"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> Mrs. Marryat said, sobbing; <sse/><qs/>"I know how you will come back.</s> <s sid="36" id="clive.c1.s36">A little, yellow, shrivelled up old man with no liver, and a dreadful temper, and a black servant.</s> <s sid="37" id="clive.c1.s37">I know what it will be."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="clive.c1.p10"><s sid="38" id="clive.c1.s38">This time Charlie could not help laughing.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="clive.c1.p11" type="speech" form="extended" position="beginning"><s sid="39" id="clive.c1.s39"><qs/>"That's looking too far ahead altogether, Mother.</s> <s sid="40" id="clive.c1.s40">You take the two extremes.</s> <s sid="41" id="clive.c1.s41">If I don't die in a fortnight, I am to live to be a shrivelled old man.</s> <s sid="42" id="clive.c1.s42">I'd rather take a happy medium, and look forward to coming back before my liver is all gone, or my temper all destroyed, with lots of money to make you and the girls comfortable.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="clive.c1.p12" type="speech" form="extended" position="end"><s sid="43" id="clive.c1.s43">"There is only one thing.</s> <s sid="44" id="clive.c1.s44">I wish it had been a cadetship, instead of a writership."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="clive.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="clive.c1.s45"><qs/>"That is my only comfort,"<qe/> Mrs. Marryat said.</s> <s sid="46" id="clive.c1.s46"><qs/>"If it had been a cadetship, I should have written to say that I would not let you go.</s> <s sid="47" id="clive.c1.s47">It is bad enough as it is; but if you had had to fight, I could not have borne it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="clive.c1.p14"><s sid="48" id="clive.c1.s48">Charlie did his best to console his mother, by telling her how everyone who went to India made fortunes, and how he should be sure to come back with plenty of money; and that, when the girls grew up, he should be able to find rich husbands for them; and at last he succeeded in getting her to look at matters in a less gloomy light.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="clive.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="clive.c1.s49"><qs/>"And I'm sure, Mother,"<qe/> he said, "Uncle means most kindly.</s> <s sid="50" id="clive.c1.s50">He sends twenty pounds, you see, and says that that is for immediate necessities; so I have no doubt he means to help to get my outfit, or at any rate to advance money, which I can repay him out of my salary.</s> <s sid="51" id="clive.c1.s51">The letter is rather stiff and businesslike, of course, but I suppose that's his way; and you see he asks about your income, so perhaps he means to help for the girls' education.</s> <s sid="52" id="clive.c1.s52">I should go away very happy, if I knew that you would be able to get on comfortably.</s> <s sid="53" id="clive.c1.s53">Of course it's a long way off, Mother, and I should have liked to stay at home, to be a help to you and the girls; but one can't have all one wishes.</s> <s sid="54" id="clive.c1.s54">As far as I am concerned, myself, I would rather go out as a writer there, where I shall see strange sights and a strange country, than be stuck all my life at a desk in London.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="clive.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="clive.c1.s55"><qs/>"What is Uncle like?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="clive.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="clive.c1.s56"><qs/>"He is a short man, my dear, rather stiff and pompous, with a very stiff cravat.</s> <s sid="57" id="clive.c1.s57">He used to give me his finger to shake, when I was a child, and I was always afraid of him.</s> <s sid="58" id="clive.c1.s58">He married a most disagreeable woman, only a year or two before I married, myself.</s> <s sid="59" id="clive.c1.s59">But I heard she died not very long afterwards;"<qe/> and so Mrs. Marryat got talking of her early days and relations, and was quite in good spirits again, by the time her daughters returned from school; and she told them what she was now coming to regard as the good fortune which had befallen their brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="clive.c1.p18"><s sid="60" id="clive.c1.s60">The girls were greatly affected.</s> <s sid="61" id="clive.c1.s61">They adored their brother, and the thought that he was going away for years was terrible to them.</s> <s sid="62" id="clive.c1.s62">Nothing that could be said pacified them in the slightest degree, and they did nothing but cry, until they retired to bed.</s> <s sid="63" id="clive.c1.s63">Charlie was much affected by their sorrow; but when they had retired, he took his hat and went out to tell the news of his approaching departure to some of his chums.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="clive.c1.p19"><s sid="64" id="clive.c1.s64">The next day, Mrs. Marryat wrote thanking her uncle for his kindness, and saying that Charlie would go round to London by the packet which sailed on the following Monday; and would, if the wind were fair and all went well, reach London on the Wednesday.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="clive.c1.p20"><s sid="65" id="clive.c1.s65">School was, of course, at once given up, and the girls also had a holiday till their brother's departure.</s> <s sid="66" id="clive.c1.s66">When the necessary clothes were ordered, there was little more to do; and Charlie spent the time, when his boy friends were in school, in walking with the girls along the shore, talking to them of the future, of the presents he would send them home, and of the life he should lead in India; while at other times he went out with his favourite schoolfellows, and joined in one last grand battle with the smack boys.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="clive.c1.p21"><s sid="67" id="clive.c1.s67">On Monday morning, after a sad farewell to his family, Charlie embarked on board the Yarmouth Belle, a packet which performed the journey to and from London once a fortnight.</s> <s sid="68" id="clive.c1.s68">She was a roomy lugger, built for stowage rather than speed, and her hold was crammed and her deck piled with packages of salted fish.</s> <s sid="69" id="clive.c1.s69">There were five or six other persons also bound for London, the journey to which was, in those days, regarded as an arduous undertaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="clive.c1.p22"><s sid="70" id="clive.c1.s70">As soon as the Yarmouth Belle issued from the mouth of the river, she began to pitch heavily; and Charlie, who from frequently going out with his father in the revenue cutter, was a good sailor, busied himself in doing his best for his afflicted fellow passengers.</s> <s sid="71" id="clive.c1.s71">Towards evening the wind got up, and shifting ahead, the captain dropped anchor off Lowestoft.</s> <s sid="72" id="clive.c1.s72">The next morning was finer, and the Yarmouth Belle continued her way.</s> <s sid="73" id="clive.c1.s73">It was not, however, till Thursday afternoon that she dropped anchor in the Pool.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="clive.c1.p23"><s sid="74" id="clive.c1.s74">Charlie was soon on shore, and giving his trunk to a porter, desired him to lead the way to Bread Street, in which his uncle resided; for in the last century, such things as country villas were almost unknown, and the merchants of London for the most part resided in the houses where they carried on their business.</s> <s sid="75" id="clive.c1.s75">Keeping close to the porter, to see that he did not make off with his trunk, for Charlie had received many warnings as to the extreme wickedness of London, he followed him through the busy streets, and arrived safely at his uncle's door.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="clive.c1.p24"><s sid="76" id="clive.c1.s76">It was now dusk, and Charlie, on giving his name, was shown upstairs to a large room, which was lighted by a fire blazing in the hearth.</s> <s sid="77" id="clive.c1.s77">Standing with his back to this was a gentleman whom he at once recognized, from his mother's description, as her uncle, although he was a good deal more portly than when she had seen him last.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="clive.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="clive.c1.s78"><qs/>"So you are my grandnephew,"<qe/> he said, holding out what Charlie considered to be a very limp and flabby hand towards him.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="clive.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="clive.c1.s79"><qs/>"Yes, Uncle,"<qe/><sss/> Charlie said cheerfully; <sse/><qs/>"and we are very much obliged to you, Mamma and I, for your kindness."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="clive.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="clive.c1.s80"><qs/>"Humph!"<qe/> the old gentleman grunted.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="clive.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="clive.c1.s81"><qs/>"And how is it,"<qe/><sss/> he asked severely, <sse/><qs/>"that you were not here yesterday?</s> <s sid="82" id="clive.c1.s82">My niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="clive.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="clive.c1.s83"><qs/>"We came as fast as we could, Uncle,"<qe/><sss/> Charlie laughed; <sse/><qs/>"but of course the time depends upon the wind.</s> <s sid="84" id="clive.c1.s84">The captain tells me that he has been as much as three weeks coming round."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="clive.c1.p30"><s sid="85" id="clive.c1.s85">Mr. Tufton grunted again as if to signify that such unpunctuality was altogether displeasing to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="clive.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="clive.c1.s86"><qs/>"You are tall,"<qe/><sls/> he said, looking up at Charlie, who stood half a head above him, <sle/><qs/>"and thin, very thin.</s> <s sid="87" id="clive.c1.s87">You have a loose way of standing, which I don't approve of."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="clive.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="clive.c1.s88"><qs/>"I'm sorry I'm loose, sir,"<qe/><sss/> Charlie said gravely, <sse/><qs/>"if you do not approve of it; but you see, running about and playing games make one lissome.</s> <s sid="89" id="clive.c1.s89">I suppose, now that's all over and I am going to spend my time in writing, I shall get stiffer."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="clive.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="clive.c1.s90"><qs/>"I hope so, I hope so,"<qe/> Mr. Tufton said encouragingly, and as if stiffness were one of the most desirable things in life.</s> <s sid="91" id="clive.c1.s91">"I like to see young men with a sedate bearing.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="clive.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="clive.c1.s92"><qs/>"And you left my niece and grandnieces well, I hope?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="clive.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="clive.c1.s93"><qs/>"Quite well, thank you, sir,"<qe/><sss/> Charlie said; <sse/><qs/>"but, of course, a good deal upset with parting from me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="clive.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="clive.c1.s94"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> Mr. Tufton said; <sse/><qs/>"I suppose so.</s> <s sid="95" id="clive.c1.s95">Women are so emotional.</s> <s sid="96" id="clive.c1.s96">Now there's nothing I object to more than emotion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="clive.c1.p37"><s sid="97" id="clive.c1.s97">As Charlie thought that this was probably the case, he was silent, although the idea vaguely occurred to him that he should like to excite a little emotion in his uncle, by the sudden insertion of a pin, or some other such means.</s> <s sid="98" id="clive.c1.s98">The silence continued for some little time, and then Mr. Tufton said:</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="clive.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="clive.c1.s99"><qs/>"I always dine at two o'clock; but as probably you are hungry--I have observed that boys always are hungry--some food will be served you in the next room.</s> <s sid="100" id="clive.c1.s100">I had already given my housekeeper orders.</s> <s sid="101" id="clive.c1.s101">No doubt you will find it prepared.</s> <s sid="102" id="clive.c1.s102">After that, you may like to take a walk in the streets.</s> <s sid="103" id="clive.c1.s103">I have supper at nine, by which hour you will, of course, have returned."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="clive.c1.p39"><s sid="104" id="clive.c1.s104">Charlie, as he ate his meal, thought to himself that his uncle was a pompous old gentleman, and that it would be very hard work getting on with him, for the next three weeks.</s> <s sid="105" id="clive.c1.s105">However, he consoled himself by the thought:</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="clive.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="clive.c1.s106"><qs/>"Kind is as kind does after all, and I expect the old gentleman is not as crusty as he looks."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="clive.c1.p41"><s sid="107" id="clive.c1.s107">Charlie had handed to Mr. Tufton a letter which his mother had given him, and when he returned from a ramble through the streets, he found that gentleman sitting by the fire, with lights upon a small table beside him.</s> <s sid="108" id="clive.c1.s108">Upon this Mrs. Marryat's letter lay open.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="clive.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="clive.c1.s109"><qs/>"So you have soon become tired of the streets of London, Grandnephew!"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="clive.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="clive.c1.s110"><qs/>"There is not much to see, sir.</s> <s sid="111" id="clive.c1.s111">The lamps do not burn very brightly, and the fog is coming on.</s> <s sid="112" id="clive.c1.s112">I thought that, if it grew thicker, I might lose my way, and in that case I might not have been in at the hour you named for supper."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="clive.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="clive.c1.s113"><qs/>"Humph!"<qe/> the other gentleman grunted.</s> <s sid="114" id="clive.c1.s114">"So your mother has taught you to be punctual to meals.</s> <s sid="115" id="clive.c1.s115">But, no; boys' appetites teach them to be punctual then, if never at any other time.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="clive.c1.p45" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="clive.c1.s116"><qs/>"And why, sir?"<qe/><sss/> he asked severely, <sse/><qs/>"Did my niece not write to me before?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="clive.c8.p3"><s sid="8" id="clive.c8.s8">At three o'clock, the firing of three shells from the mortars into the fort gave the signal for assault.</s> <s sid="9" id="clive.c8.s9">The men leaped up and stood to their arms, full of confidence in their ability to resist the attack.</s> <s sid="10" id="clive.c8.s10">Soon the shouts of the advancing columns testified to the equal confidence and ardour of the assailants.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="clive.c8.p5"><s sid="15" id="clive.c8.s15">Scarcely less prolonged was the struggle at the breaches.</s> <s sid="16" id="clive.c8.s16">At the first breach, a very strong force of the enemy marched resolutely forward.</s> <s sid="17" id="clive.c8.s17">They were permitted, without a shot being fired at them, to cross the dry ditch, mount the shattered debris of the wall, and pour into the interior of the fort.</s> <s sid="18" id="clive.c8.s18">Forward they advanced until, without a check, they reached the first trench bristling with spikes.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="clive.c8.p8"><s sid="26" id="clive.c8.s26">Among those who had fallen, at the great breach, was the commander of the storming party; a man of great valour.</s> <s sid="27" id="clive.c8.s27">Four hundred of his followers had also been killed, and Riza Sahib, utterly disheartened at his repulse at all points, decided not to renew the attack.</s> <s sid="28" id="clive.c8.s28">He had still more than twenty men to each of the defenders; but the obstinacy of their resistance, and the moral effect produced by it upon his troops; the knowledge that the Mahratta horse were hovering in his rear, and that Kilpatrick's little column was close at hand; determined him to raise the siege.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="clive.c8.p9"><s sid="29" id="clive.c8.s29">After the repulse of the assault, the heavy musketry fire from the houses around the fort was continued.</s> <s sid="30" id="clive.c8.s30">At two in the afternoon he asked for two hours' truce, to bury the dead.</s> <s sid="31" id="clive.c8.s31">This was granted, and on its conclusion the musketry fire was resumed, and continued until two in the morning.</s> <s sid="32" id="clive.c8.s32">Then suddenly, it ceased.</s> <s sid="33" id="clive.c8.s33">Under cover of the fire, Riza Sahib had raised the siege, and retired with his army to Vellore.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="clive.c8.p12"><s sid="42" id="clive.c8.s42">Not a moment was lost, for Clive felt the importance of, at once, following up the blow inflicted by the repulse of the enemy.</s> <s sid="43" id="clive.c8.s43">Three days were spent, in continuous labour, in putting the fort of Arcot again in a position of defence; and, leaving Kilpatrick in charge there, he marched out with two hundred Europeans, seven hundred Sepoys, and three guns, and attacked and took Timari, the little fort which before baffled him.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="clive.c8.p13"><s sid="44" id="clive.c8.s44">This done, he returned towards Arcot to await the arrival of a thousand Mahratta horse, which Murari Reo had promised him.</s> <s sid="45" id="clive.c8.s45">When these arrived, however, they proved unwilling to accompany him.</s> <s sid="46" id="clive.c8.s46">Upon their way, they had fallen in with a portion of Riza Sahib's retreating force, and had been worsted in the attack; and as the chance of plunder seemed small, while the prospect of hard blows was certain, the free-booting horsemen refused, absolutely, to join in the pursuit of the retreating enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="clive.c8.p14"><s sid="47" id="clive.c8.s47">Just at this moment, the news came in that reinforcements from Pondicherry were marching to meet Riza Sahib at Arni, a place seventeen miles south of Arcot, twenty south of Vellore.</s> <s sid="48" id="clive.c8.s48">It was stated that, with these reinforcements, a large sum of money was being brought, for the use of Riza Sahib's army.</s> <s sid="49" id="clive.c8.s49">When the Mahrattas heard the news, the chance of booty at once altered their intentions, and they declared themselves ready to follow Clive.</s> <s sid="50" id="clive.c8.s50">The greater portion of them, however, had dispersed, plundering over the country, and great delay was caused before they could be collected.</s> <s sid="51" id="clive.c8.s51">When six hundred of them had been brought together, Clive determined to wait no longer, but started at once for Arni.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="clive.c8.p15"><s sid="52" id="clive.c8.s52">The delay enabled Riza Sahib, marching down from Vellore, to meet his reinforcements; and when Clive, after a forced march of twenty miles, approached Arni, he found the enemy, composed of three hundred French troops, two thousand five hundred Sepoys, and two thousand horsemen, with four guns, drawn up before it.</s> <s sid="53" id="clive.c8.s53">Seeing their immense superiority in numbers, these advanced to the attack.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="clive.c8.p17"><s sid="61" id="clive.c8.s61">The enemy advanced at once.</s> <s sid="62" id="clive.c8.s62">His native cavalry, with some infantry, marched against the grove; while the French troops, with about fifteen hundred infantry, moved along the causeway against the village.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="clive.c8.p18"><s sid="63" id="clive.c8.s63">The fight began on the English left.</s> <s sid="64" id="clive.c8.s64">There the Mahratta cavalry fought bravely.</s> <s sid="65" id="clive.c8.s65">Issuing from the palm grove, they made repeated charges against the greatly superior forces of the enemy.</s> <s sid="66" id="clive.c8.s66">But numbers told, and the Mahrattas, fighting fiercely, were driven back into the palm grove; where they, with difficulty, maintained themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="clive.c8.p19"><s sid="67" id="clive.c8.s67">In the meantime, the fight was going on at the centre.</s> <s sid="68" id="clive.c8.s68">Clive opened fire with his guns on the long column marching, almost across his front, to attack the village.</s> <s sid="69" id="clive.c8.s69">The enemy, finding themselves exposed to a fire which they were powerless to answer, quitted the causeway, and formed up in the rice fields fronting the English position.</s> <s sid="70" id="clive.c8.s70">The guns, protected only by a few Frenchmen and natives, remained on the causeway.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="clive.c8.p20"><s sid="71" id="clive.c8.s71">Clive now despatched two of his guns, and fifty English, to aid the hard-pressed Mahrattas in the grove; and fifty others to the village, with orders to join the Sepoys there, to dash forward on to the causeway, and charge the enemy's guns.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="clive.c8.p21"><s sid="72" id="clive.c8.s72">As the column issued from the village along the causeway, at a rapid pace, the French limbered up their guns and retired at a gallop.</s> <s sid="73" id="clive.c8.s73">The infantry, dispirited at their disappearance, fell back across the rice fields; an example which their horsemen on their right, already dispirited by the loss which they were suffering, from the newly-arrived English musketry and the discharges of the field pieces, followed without delay.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="clive.c8.p22"><s sid="74" id="clive.c8.s74">Clive at once ordered a pursuit.</s> <s sid="75" id="clive.c8.s75">The Mahrattas were despatched after the enemy's cavalry, while he himself, with his infantry, advanced across the causeway and pressed upon the main body.</s> <s sid="76" id="clive.c8.s76">Three times the enemy made a stand, but each time failed to resist the impetuosity of the pursuers, and the night alone put a stop to the pursuit, by which time the enemy were completely routed.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="clive.c8.p23"><s sid="77" id="clive.c8.s77">The material loss had not been heavy, for but fifty French and a hundred and fifty natives were killed or wounded; but the army was broken up, the morale of the enemy completely destroyed; and it was proved to all Southern India, which was anxiously watching the struggle, that the English were, in the field of battle, superior to their European rivals.</s> <s sid="78" id="clive.c8.s78">This assurance alone had an immense effect.</s> <s sid="79" id="clive.c8.s79">It confirmed, in their alliance with the English, many of the chiefs whose friendship had hitherto been lukewarm; and brought over many waverers to our side.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="clive.c8.p24"><s sid="80" id="clive.c8.s80">In the fight, eight Sepoys and fifty of the Mahratta cavalry were killed or disabled.</s> <s sid="81" id="clive.c8.s81">The English did not lose a single man.</s> <s sid="82" id="clive.c8.s82">Many of Riza Sahib's soldiers came in, during the next few days, and enlisted in the British force.</s> <s sid="83" id="clive.c8.s83">The Mahrattas captured the treasure, the prospect of which had induced them to join in the fight, and the governor of Arni agreed to hold the town for Muhammud Ali.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="clive.c8.p25"><s sid="84" id="clive.c8.s84">Clive moved on at once to Conjeveram, where thirty French troops and three hundred Sepoys occupied the temple, a very strong building.</s> <s sid="85" id="clive.c8.s85">Clive brought up two eighteen-pounders from Madras, and pounded the walls; and the enemy, seeing that the place must fall, evacuated it in the night, and retired to Pondicherry.</s> <s sid="86" id="clive.c8.s86">North Arcot being now completely in the power of the English, Clive returned to Madras; and then sailed to Fort Saint David, to concert measures with Mr. Saunders for the relief of Trichinopoli.</s> <s sid="87" id="clive.c8.s87">This place still held out, thanks rather to the feebleness and indecision of Colonel Law, who commanded the besiegers, than to any effort on the part of the defenders.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="clive.c21.p34"><s sid="105" id="clive.c21.s105">To show his determination, he despatched fifteen hundred men to Hoogly, which the English had abandoned after capturing it, with instructions to help the French if attacked; and he sent a lac of rupees to Monsieur Renault, to aid him in preparing for his defence.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="clive.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="clive.c22.s1">As the English troops advanced, they were met on the outskirts of the settlement by the enemy, who contested bravely every garden and inclosure with them.</s> <s sid="2" id="clive.c22.s2">The British force was, however, too strong to be resisted, and gradually the French were driven back, until they formed in rear of the battery.</s> <s sid="3" id="clive.c22.s3">Clive at once took possession of the houses surrounding it, and from them kept up, all day, a heavy fire upon the defenders; until, at nightfall, these fell back upon the fort, after spiking their guns.</s> <s sid="4" id="clive.c22.s4">The loss of this position compelled the French to abandon the other outlying batteries, from which, during the night, they withdrew their guns into the fort.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="clive.c22.p2"><s sid="5" id="clive.c22.s5">The next four days Clive spent in bringing up the guns landed from the fleet, and establishing batteries round the fort; and on the 19th he opened fire against it.</s> <s sid="6" id="clive.c22.s6">On the same day the three men of war; the Kent of sixty-four guns, the Tiger of sixty, and the Salisbury of fifty, anchored just below the channel, which the governor believed he had blocked up.</s> <s sid="7" id="clive.c22.s7">The next four days were spent by the fleet in sounding, to discover whether the statements of the French deserter were correct.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="clive.c22.p3"><s sid="8" id="clive.c22.s8">During this time, a heavy cannonade was kept up unceasingly between Clive and the fort.</s> <s sid="9" id="clive.c22.s9">In this the garrison had the best of it, silenced some of the English guns, killed many of the assailants, and would certainly have beaten off the land attack, had the fleet not been able to interfere in the struggle.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="clive.c22.p4"><s sid="10" id="clive.c22.s10">All this time, the governor was hoping that aid would arrive from the nabob.</s> <s sid="11" id="clive.c22.s11">The latter, indeed, did send a force under Rajah Dulab Ram, but the governor of Hoogly, bribed by Omichund, sent messages to this officer urging him to halt, as Chandranagore was about to surrender, and he would only incur the anger of the English, uselessly.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="clive.c22.p5"><s sid="12" id="clive.c22.s12">On the morning of the 23rd, having ascertained that a channel was free, the fleet advanced.</s> <s sid="13" id="clive.c22.s13">The Tiger, leading, made her way through the passage and, taking up a position abreast of the northeast bastion of the fort, opened a heavy fire upon it with her guns, and harassed the besieged with a musketry fire from her tops.</s> <s sid="14" id="clive.c22.s14">The Kent was on the point of anchoring opposite the watergate, when so heavy a fire was poured upon her that, in the confusion, the cable ran out; and the ship dropped down, till she anchored at a point exposed to a heavy crossfire from the southeast and southwest bastions.</s> <s sid="15" id="clive.c22.s15">Owing to this accident, the Salisbury was forced to anchor a hundred and fifty yards below the fort.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="clive.c22.p6"><s sid="16" id="clive.c22.s16">The French fought with extreme bravery.</s> <s sid="17" id="clive.c22.s17">Vastly superior as were the English force and guns, the French fire was maintained with the greatest energy and spirit, the gunners being directed and animated by Monsieur De Vignes, captain of one of the ships which had been sunk.</s> <s sid="18" id="clive.c22.s18">No advantage was gained by the Tiger, in her struggle with the northeast bastion, and the guns of the southwest bastion galled the Kent so severely that the admiral, neglecting the southeast bastion, was forced to turn the whole of his guns upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="clive.c22.p7"><s sid="19" id="clive.c22.s19">De Vignes concentrated his fire against one point in the Kent, and presently succeeded in setting her on fire.</s> <s sid="20" id="clive.c22.s20">The conflagration spread, a panic ensued, and some seventy or eighty men jumped into the boats alongside.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="clive.c22.p8"><s sid="21" id="clive.c22.s21">The officers, however, rallied the rest of the crew.</s> <s sid="22" id="clive.c22.s22">The fire was extinguished, the men returned to their duty, and the cannonade was recommenced.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="clive.c22.p9"><s sid="23" id="clive.c22.s23">After the battle had raged for two hours, the fire of the fort began to slacken, as one after another of the guns was dismounted.</s> <s sid="24" id="clive.c22.s24">Monsieur Renault saw that the place could be no longer defended.</s> <s sid="25" id="clive.c22.s25">Of his hundred and forty-six soldiers, over ninety had been killed and wounded.</s> <s sid="26" id="clive.c22.s26">Collecting the remainder, and their officers, with twenty Sepoys, the governor ordered them to leave the fort immediately; making a detour to avoid the English, who were aiding the fleet by attacking the land side, and to march to Kossimbazar to join Monsieur Law, who commanded there.</s> <s sid="27" id="clive.c22.s27">Then, there remaining in the fort only the clerks, women, and wounded, he hoisted a flag of truce.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="clive.c22.p10"><s sid="28" id="clive.c22.s28">Terms were speedily arranged.</s> <s sid="29" id="clive.c22.s29">The governor, and all the civilians and natives, were allowed to go where they chose, with their clothes and linen.</s> <s sid="30" id="clive.c22.s30">The wounded French soldiers were to remain, as prisoners of war.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="clive.c22.p11"><s sid="31" id="clive.c22.s31">Chandranagore cost the English two hundred and six men.</s> <s sid="32" id="clive.c22.s32">The attack upon the French colony was blamed by many, at the time, for in the hour of English distress they had offered to remain neutral, instead of joining the nabob in crushing us.</s> <s sid="33" id="clive.c22.s33">Upon the other hand, there was force in the arguments with which Admiral Watson had defended his refusal to sign the treaty of neutrality.</s> <s sid="34" id="clive.c22.s34">That treaty would not be binding, unless ratified by Pondicherry; and to Pondicherry it was known that the most powerful fleet and army France had ever sent to India was on its way.</s> <s sid="35" id="clive.c22.s35">It was also known that Bussy, at the court of the Nizam of the Deccan, was in communication with the nabob.</s> <s sid="36" id="clive.c22.s36">Thus, then, in a short time English interests in India might be menaced more formidably than ever before, and the crushing out of the French colony, almost at the gates of Calcutta, was a measure of extreme importance.</s> <s sid="37" id="clive.c22.s37">It was hard upon the gallant governor of Chandranagore, but public opinion generally agreed that the urgency of the case justified the course adopted by the English authorities at Calcutta.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="clive.c22.p12"><s sid="38" id="clive.c22.s38">Suraja-u-Dowlah was filled with fury, at the news of the capture of Chandranagore; but hearing a rumour, two days later, that the Afghans were upon their march to attack him, he wrote letters to Clive and Watson, congratulating them upon their success, and offering to them the territory of Chandranagore, on the same terms upon which it had been held by the French.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="clive.c22.p13"><s sid="39" id="clive.c22.s39">But the young tyrant of Moorshedabad was swayed by constantly fluctuating feeling.</s> <s sid="40" id="clive.c22.s40">At one moment his fears were uppermost; the next, his anger and hate of the English.</s> <s sid="41" id="clive.c22.s41">Instead of recalling the army of Rajah Dulab Ram, as he had promised, he ordered it to halt at Plassey, a large village twenty-two miles south of Moorshedabad.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="clive.c22.p14"><s sid="42" id="clive.c22.s42">The English were represented at his court by Mr. Watts, who had the greatest difficulty in maintaining his position, in the constantly changing moods of the nabob.</s> <s sid="43" id="clive.c22.s43">One day the latter would threaten to order him to be led to instant execution, the next he would load him with presents.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="clive.c22.p15"><s sid="44" id="clive.c22.s44">Besides Mr. Watts, the English affairs were conducted by Omichund who, aided by the Sets, or native bankers, whom Suraja-u-Dowlah had plundered and despoiled, got up a conspiracy among the nabob's most intimate followers.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="clive.c22.p16"><s sid="45" id="clive.c22.s45">The history of these intrigues is the most unpleasant feature in the life of Clive.</s> <s sid="46" id="clive.c22.s46">Meer Jaffier, the nabob's general, himself offered to Mr. Watts to turn traitor, if the succession to the kingdom was bestowed upon him.</s> <s sid="47" id="clive.c22.s47">This was agreed to, upon his promise to pay, not only immense sums to the Company, but enormous amounts to the principal persons on the English side.</s> <s sid="48" id="clive.c22.s48">So enormous, indeed, were these demands, that even Meer Jaffier, anxious as he was to conclude the alliance, was aghast.</s> <s sid="49" id="clive.c22.s49">The squadron was to have two million and a half rupees, and the same amount was to be paid for the army.</s> <s sid="50" id="clive.c22.s50">Presents amounting to six millions of rupees were to be distributed between Clive, Major Kilpatrick, the governor, and the members of the council.</s> <s sid="51" id="clive.c22.s51">Clive's share of these enormous sums amounted to two million, eighty thousand rupees.</s> <s sid="52" id="clive.c22.s52">In those days, a rupee was worth half a crown.</s> <s sid="53" id="clive.c22.s53">Never did an English officer make such a bargain for himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="clive.c22.p17"><s sid="54" id="clive.c22.s54">But even this is not the most dishonorable feature of the transaction.</s> <s sid="55" id="clive.c22.s55">Omichund had, for some time, been kept in the dark as to what was going forward; but, obtaining information through his agents, he questioned Mr. Watts concerning it.</s> <s sid="56" id="clive.c22.s56">The latter then informed him of the whole state of affairs, and Omichund, whose services to the English had been immense, naturally demanded a share of the plunder.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="clive.c22.p18"><s sid="57" id="clive.c22.s57">Whether or not he threatened to divulge the plot to the nabob, unless his demands were satisfied, is doubtful.</s> <s sid="58" id="clive.c22.s58">At any rate, it was considered prudent to pacify him, and he was accordingly told that he should receive the sum he named.</s> <s sid="59" id="clive.c22.s59">Clive, and the members of the council, however, although willing to gratify their own extortionate greed, at the expense of Meer Jaffier, determined to rob Omichund of his share.</s> <s sid="60" id="clive.c22.s60">In order to do this, two copies of the treaty with Meer Jaffier were drawn up, on different coloured papers.</s> <s sid="61" id="clive.c22.s61">They were exactly alike, except that, in one, the amount to be given to Omichund was entirely omitted.</s> <s sid="62" id="clive.c22.s62">This was the real treaty.</s> <s sid="63" id="clive.c22.s63">The other was intended to be destroyed, after being shown to a friend of Omichund, in order to convince the latter that all was straight and honorable.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="clive.c22.p19"><s sid="64" id="clive.c22.s64">All the English authorities placed their signatures to the real treaty, but Admiral Watson indignantly refused to have anything to do with the fictitious one; or to be a party, in any way, to the deceit practised on Omichund.</s> <s sid="65" id="clive.c22.s65">In order to get out of the difficulty, Clive himself forged Admiral Watson's signature to the fictitious treaty.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="clive.c22.p20"><s sid="66" id="clive.c22.s66">A more disgraceful transaction was never entered into, by a body of English gentlemen.</s> <s sid="67" id="clive.c22.s67">That Mr. Drake and the members of his council, the pitiful cowards who fled from Calcutta, and refused to allow the ships to draw off its brave garrison, should consent to such a transaction was but natural; but that Clive, the gallant and dashing commander, should have stooped to it, is sad, indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="clive.c22.p21"><s sid="68" id="clive.c22.s68">It may be said that, to the end of his life, Clive defended his conduct in this transaction, under the excuse that Omichund was a scoundrel.</s> <s sid="69" id="clive.c22.s69">The Indian was not, indeed, an estimable character.</s> <s sid="70" id="clive.c22.s70">Openly, he was the friend and confidant of the nabob while, all the time, he was engaged in bribing and corrupting his officers, and in plotting with his enemies.</s> <s sid="71" id="clive.c22.s71">This, however, in no way alters the facts that he rendered inestimable service to the English; and that the men who deceived and cheated him were, to the full, as greedy and grasping as himself; without, in the case of the governor and his council, having rendered any service whatever to the cause.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="clive.c22.p22"><s sid="72" id="clive.c22.s72">At last, the negotiations were complete.</s> <s sid="73" id="clive.c22.s73">More and more severely did Clive press upon the nabob.</s> <s sid="74" id="clive.c22.s74">Having compelled him to expel Law and the French, first from Moorshedabad and then from his dominions, he pressed fresh demands upon him; until the unfortunate prince, driven to despair, and buoyed up with the hope that he should receive assistance from Bussy, who had just expelled the English from their factory at Vizapatam, ordered Meer Jaffier to advance, with fifteen thousand men, to reinforce Rajah Dulab Ram at Plassey.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="clive.c22.p23"><s sid="75" id="clive.c22.s75">Clive, in fact, forced on hostilities.</s> <s sid="76" id="clive.c22.s76">His presence, with that of a considerable portion of his army, was urgently required at Madras.</s> <s sid="77" id="clive.c22.s77">He was sure, however, that the instant he had gone, and the English force was greatly weakened, the nabob would again commence hostilities; and the belief was shared by all in India.</s> <s sid="78" id="clive.c22.s78">He was, therefore, determined to force on the crisis, as soon as possible; in order that, the nabob being disposed of, he should be able to send reinforcements to Madras.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="clive.c22.p24"><s sid="79" id="clive.c22.s79">While these negotiations had been going on, Charlie Marryat had remained in Calcutta.</s> <s sid="80" id="clive.c22.s80">He had been severely wounded in the attack on Chandranagore, and was carried down to Calcutta in a boat.</s> <s sid="81" id="clive.c22.s81">On arriving there, he heard that the Lizzie Anderson had just cast anchor off the fort.</s> <s sid="82" id="clive.c22.s82">He caused himself at once to be conveyed on board, and was received with the greatest heartiness and pleasure, by his old friend, the captain; and assiduously attended by the doctor of the ship.</s> <s sid="83" id="clive.c22.s83">In order that he might have as much air as possible, the captain had a sort of tent, with a double covering, erected on deck.</s> <s sid="84" id="clive.c22.s84">During the daytime the sides of this were lifted, so that the air could pass freely across the bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="clive.c22.p25"><s sid="85" id="clive.c22.s85">Charlie's wound was a severe one and, had he been nursed in a hospital on shore, it is probable that it would have been fatal.</s> <s sid="86" id="clive.c22.s86">Thanks, however, to the comforts on board ship, the freshness and coolness of the situation, and the care of all surrounding him, he was, after some weeks' illness, pronounced convalescent; and was sufficiently recovered to join the force with which Clive marched against Plassey.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="clive.c22.p26"><s sid="87" id="clive.c22.s87">This force consisted of nine hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred artillerymen, fifty sailors, and two thousand one hundred Sepoys.</s> <s sid="88" id="clive.c22.s88">The artillery consisted of eight six-pounders and two small howitzers.</s> <s sid="89" id="clive.c22.s89">The army of the nabob was fifty thousand strong, and against such a force it was, indeed, an adventurous task for an army of three thousand men, of whom only one-third were Europeans, to advance to the attack.</s> <s sid="90" id="clive.c22.s90">Everything depended, in fact, upon Meer Jaffier and his two colleagues in treachery, Rajah Dulab Ram and Yar Lutf Khan.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="clive.c22.p27"><s sid="91" id="clive.c22.s91">The nabob, on hearing of Clive's advance, had sent to Monsieur Law; who was, with a hundred and fifty men, at a place over a hundred miles distant; to which he had, in accordance with the orders of Clive, been obliged to retire; and begged him to advance to join him, with all speed.</s> <s sid="92" id="clive.c22.s92">The nabob had with him forty or fifty Frenchmen, commanded by Monsieur Saint Frais, formerly one of the council of Chandranagore.</s> <s sid="93" id="clive.c22.s93">These had some field pieces of their own, and also directed the native artillery, of fifty-three guns; principally thirty-two, twenty-four, and eighteen pounders.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="clive.c22.p28"><s sid="94" id="clive.c22.s94">Had Clive been sure of the cooperation of Meer Jaffier and his confederates, who commanded three out of the four divisions of the nabob's army, he need not have hesitated.</s> <s sid="95" id="clive.c22.s95">But he was, till the last moment, in ignorance whether to rely upon them.</s> <s sid="96" id="clive.c22.s96">The nabob, having become suspicious of Meer Jaffier, had obtained from him an oath, sworn on the Koran, of fidelity; and although the traitor continued his correspondence with Clive, his letters were of a very dubious character, and Clive was in total ignorance as to his real intentions.</s> <s sid="97" id="clive.c22.s97">So doubtful, indeed, was he that, when only a few miles of ground and the river Bhagirathi lay between him and the enemy, Clive felt the position so serious that he called a council of war; and put to them the question whether they should attack the nabob, or fortify themselves at Katwa, and hold that place until the rainy season, which had just set in with great violence, should abate.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="clive.c22.p29"><s sid="98" id="clive.c22.s98">All the officers above the rank of subalterns, twenty in number, were present.</s> <s sid="99" id="clive.c22.s99">Clive himself, contrary to custom, gave his vote first in favour of halting at Katwa.</s> <s sid="100" id="clive.c22.s100">Major Kilpatrick, who commanded the Company's troops, Major Grant of the 37th, and ten other officers voted the same way.</s> <s sid="101" id="clive.c22.s101">Major Eyre Coote declared in favour of an immediate advance.</s> <s sid="102" id="clive.c22.s102">He argued that the troops were in high spirits, and had hitherto been everywhere successful, and that a delay would allow Monsieur Law and his troops to arrive.</s> <s sid="103" id="clive.c22.s103">He considered that, if they determined not to fight, they should fall back upon Calcutta.</s> <s sid="104" id="clive.c22.s104">Charlie Marryat supported him, as did five other officers, all belonging to the Indian service.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="clive.c22.p30"><s sid="105" id="clive.c22.s105">The decision taken, the council separated, and Clive strolled away to a grove, and sat down by himself.</s> <s sid="106" id="clive.c22.s106">There he thought over, in his mind, the arguments which had been advanced by both sides.</s> <s sid="107" id="clive.c22.s107">He saw the force of the arguments which had been adduced by Major Eyre Coote and Charlie Marryat; and his own experience showed him that the daring course is always the most prudent one, in fighting Asiatics.</s> <s sid="108" id="clive.c22.s108">At last, he came to a conclusion.</s> <s sid="109" id="clive.c22.s109">Rising, he returned to the camp; and, meeting Major Coote on the way, informed him that he had changed his mind, and would fight the next day.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="clive.c22.p31"><s sid="110" id="clive.c22.s110">Charlie returned to his tent after the council broke up, disheartened at the result.</s> <s sid="111" id="clive.c22.s111">He was greeted by Tim.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="clive.c25.p31"><s sid="93" id="clive.c25.s93">For a week the siege continued, and then Charlie determined to evacuate the place.</s> <s sid="94" id="clive.c25.s94">The rajah's treasure was made up into small sacks, which were fastened to the horses' croups.</s> <s sid="95" id="clive.c25.s95">Had it not been for these animals, he would have defended the place to the last, confident in his power to devise fresh means to repel fresh assaults.</s> <s sid="96" id="clive.c25.s96">The store of forage, however, collected by the enemy for their own use in the temple, was now exhausted.</s> <s sid="97" id="clive.c25.s97">Charlie directed Peters, with twenty men, to sally out from the gate at midnight, to enter the nearest house on the right hand side, and to follow the communications made by the enemy before the assault, until they came to the end of the street.</s> <s sid="98" id="clive.c25.s98">Lieutenant Hallowes, with a similar party, was to take the left side.</s> <s sid="99" id="clive.c25.s99">If they found any guards within the houses, they were to overpower these; and, rushing straight on, to attack the battery, and spike the guns.</s> <s sid="100" id="clive.c25.s100">Should they find the houses deserted, they were to gather in the houses nearest the battery, when Peters was to fire his pistol as a signal to Hallowes, and both parties were to attack the battery.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="clive.c26.p1"><s sid="1" id="clive.c26.s1">At last, weary of inactivity, the Marquis de Conflans and Colonel Forde arrived simultaneously, on the 8th of December, at a determination to bring matters to a crisis.</s> <s sid="2" id="clive.c26.s2">Conflans had heard, from a deserter, that Forde had omitted to occupy a mound which, at a short distance from his camp, commanded the position.</s> <s sid="3" id="clive.c26.s3">He determined to seize this during the night, and to open fire with his guns, and that his main army should take advantage of the confusion, which the sudden attack would occasion, to fall upon the English.</s> <s sid="4" id="clive.c26.s4">Forde, on his part, had determined to march at four o'clock in the morning to a village named Condore, three miles distant, whence he could threaten the French flank.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="clive.c26.p2"><s sid="5" id="clive.c26.s5">Ignorant of each other's intentions, the English and French left their camps at night.</s> <s sid="6" id="clive.c26.s6">Forde marched at a quarter past four, as arranged with Anandraz; but the rajah and his people, with the usual native aversion to punctuality, remained quietly asleep, and a few minutes after daybreak they were roughly awakened, by a deadly fire poured by six guns into the camp.</s> <s sid="7" id="clive.c26.s7">The rajah sent messenger after messenger to Forde, urging him to return; and he himself, with his frightened army, hurried towards Condore.</s> <s sid="8" id="clive.c26.s8">Forde had, indeed, retraced his steps immediately he heard the fire of the guns, and soon met the rajah's rabble in full flight; and, uniting with them, marched back to Condore.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="clive.c26.p3"><s sid="9" id="clive.c26.s9">Conflans supposed that the fire of his guns had driven the whole of his opponents in a panic from Chambol; and, determining to take advantage of the confusion, marched with his force against them.</s> <s sid="10" id="clive.c26.s10">Forde at once prepared for the battle.</s> <s sid="11" id="clive.c26.s11">In the centre he placed the English, including the rajah's forty Europeans.</s> <s sid="12" id="clive.c26.s12">Next to these, on either side, he placed his Sepoys, and posted the troops of Anandraz on the right and left flanks.</s> <s sid="13" id="clive.c26.s13">He then advanced towards the enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="clive.c26.p4"><s sid="14" id="clive.c26.s14">The French guns opened fire.</s> <s sid="15" id="clive.c26.s15">Forde halted.</s> <s sid="16" id="clive.c26.s16">In the position in which he found himself, his centre occupied a field of Indian corn, so high that they were concealed from the enemy.</s> <s sid="17" id="clive.c26.s17">Conflans had moved towards the English left, with the intention, apparently, of turning that flank; and after the artillery battle on both sides had continued for forty minutes, he ordered his troops to advance.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="clive.c26.p5"><s sid="18" id="clive.c26.s18">In Madras, both the English and French dress their Sepoys in white.</s> <s sid="19" id="clive.c26.s19">In Bengal, however, since the raising of Sepoy regiments after the recapture of Calcutta, the English had clothed them in red.</s> <s sid="20" id="clive.c26.s20">Conflans, therefore, thought that the force he was about to attack was the English contingent; and that, if he could defeat this, the rout of his enemy would be secured.</s> <s sid="21" id="clive.c26.s21">The French advanced with great rapidity, and attacked the Sepoys in front and flank, so vigorously that they broke in disorder.</s> <s sid="22" id="clive.c26.s22">The rajah's troops fled instantly; and, in spite of the exhortations of Forde, the Sepoys presently followed their example, and fled with the rajah's troops to Chambol, pursued by the enemy's horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="clive.c26.p6"><s sid="23" id="clive.c26.s23">They would have suffered even more severely than they did, in this pursuit, had not Charlie Marryat launched his little squadron at the enemy's horse.</s> <s sid="24" id="clive.c26.s24">Keeping his men well together, he made repeated charges, several times riding through and through them; until at last they desisted from the pursuit and, forming in a compact body, fell back towards the field of battle; Charlie, who had already lost twelve men, not thinking it prudent again to attack so strong a force.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="clive.c26.p7"><s sid="25" id="clive.c26.s25">Conflans' easy success over the Sepoys was fatal to him.</s> <s sid="26" id="clive.c26.s26">Believing that he had defeated the English, he gave orders to several companies of the French troops to press on in pursuit, without delay.</s> <s sid="27" id="clive.c26.s27">They started off in hot speed, proceeding without much order or regularity, when they were suddenly confronted by the whole line of English troops, in solid order, advancing from the high corn to take the place lately occupied by the Sepoys.</s> <s sid="28" id="clive.c26.s28">In vain, the scattered and surprised companies of the French endeavoured to reform, and make head against them.</s> <s sid="29" id="clive.c26.s29">So heavy was the fire of musketry opened by the British line, immediately they had taken up their position, that the French broke their ranks, and ran back as fast as they could to regain their guns, which were fully half a mile in the rear.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="clive.c26.p8"><s sid="30" id="clive.c26.s30">In the meantime, the French Sepoys on their left had been gradually driving back the English right; but Forde, disregarding this, pressed forward in hot pursuit of the French with his English, behind whom the greater portion of the beaten Sepoys had already rallied.</s> <s sid="31" id="clive.c26.s31">Keeping his men well together, he advanced at the fullest speed, following so closely upon the enemy that the latter had only time to fire one or two rounds, with their thirteen guns, before the English were upon them.</s> <s sid="32" id="clive.c26.s32">The French, who had already lost heart by the serious check which had befallen them, were unable to stand the shock, and at once retreated, leaving their guns behind them.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="clive.c26.p9"><s sid="33" id="clive.c26.s33">As Forde had anticipated, the French Sepoys, seeing their centre and right defeated, desisted from their attack on the English right, and fell back upon their camp.</s> <s sid="34" id="clive.c26.s34">The English Sepoys at once marched forward, and joined Forde's force.</s> <s sid="35" id="clive.c26.s35">The rajah's troops, however, the whole of whom had fled, remained cowering in the shelter of a large dry tank.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="clive.c26.p10"><s sid="36" id="clive.c26.s36">Forde did not wait for them; but, leaving his guns behind him, pressed forward, an hour after the defeat of the French, against their camp.</s> <s sid="37" id="clive.c26.s37">To reach this, he had to pass along a narrow valley, commanded by the French heavy guns.</s> <s sid="38" id="clive.c26.s38">These opened fire, but the English pressed forward without wavering.</s> <s sid="39" id="clive.c26.s39">The defenders, not yet recovered from the effects of their defeat in the plain, at once gave way, and retreated in the utmost confusion towards Rajahmahendri.</s> <s sid="40" id="clive.c26.s40">Had the cavalry of Anandraz been at hand to follow up the advantage, great numbers might have been captured.</s> <s sid="41" id="clive.c26.s41">As it was, Charlie Marryat, with his little force, harassed them for some miles; but was unable to effect any serious damage on so strong a body.</s> <s sid="42" id="clive.c26.s42">The English captured thirty-two pieces of cannon, and all the stores, ammunition, and tents of the French.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="clive.c26.p11"><s sid="43" id="clive.c26.s43">Forde at once despatched a battalion of Sepoys, under Captain Knox, in pursuit; and this officer pressed on so vigorously that he approached Rajahmahendri the same evening.</s> <s sid="44" id="clive.c26.s44">Two more native battalions reached Knox during the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="clive.c26.p12"><s sid="45" id="clive.c26.s45">So thoroughly dispirited were the enemy, that the sight of the red-coated Sepoys of Knox, whom they could not distinguish from English, induced them to abandon Rajahmahendri in all haste, although it contained a strong mud fort, with several guns.</s> <s sid="46" id="clive.c26.s46">The Godavery is two miles wide, and all night the passage of the river in boats continued; and when, at daybreak next morning, Knox broke into the town, he found fifteen Europeans still on the banks, expecting a returning boat.</s> <s sid="47" id="clive.c26.s47">These he captured; and seeing, upon the opposite bank, a party about to disembark guns and stores from another boat, he opened fire from the guns of the fort towards it; and, although the shot could scarcely reach halfway across the river, such was the terror of the enemy that they forsook the boat, and fled.</s> <s sid="48" id="clive.c26.s48">Knox at once sent a boat across, and brought back that containing the guns.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="clive.c26.p13"><s sid="49" id="clive.c26.s49">The French retreated to Masulipatam, the capital of the province, a port which rivalled Madras in its commerce.</s> <s sid="50" id="clive.c26.s50">Forde determined to follow them there, but he was hindered by want of money to pay his troops.</s> <s sid="51" id="clive.c26.s51">This the Rajah Anandraz, who had promised to supply money, now, excited and arrogant by the victory which he had done nothing towards gaining, refused to supply; and many weeks were spent in negotiations, before Forde was able to move forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="clive.c26.p14"><s sid="52" id="clive.c26.s52">Charlie was no longer with him.</s> <s sid="53" id="clive.c26.s53">The very day before the fight of Condore, letters had arrived from Madras, stating the urgency of the position there; and, upon the night after the battle, Colonel Forde ordered Charlie to return to aid in the defence of that city, before which the French had appeared on the 29th of November.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="clive.c26.p15"><s sid="54" id="clive.c26.s54">Several skirmishes took place outside the city, and the English then retired within the fort.</s> <s sid="55" id="clive.c26.s55">The force consisted of sixteen hundred white troops, and two thousand three hundred Sepoys.</s> <s sid="56" id="clive.c26.s56">The nabob, who had also retired into the town, had two hundred horse and a huge retinue of attendants.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="clive.c26.p16"><s sid="57" id="clive.c26.s57">On the morning of the 14th the French occupied the town, and the next day the English made a sortie, with six hundred men.</s> <s sid="58" id="clive.c26.s58">These, for a while, drove the French before them through the streets of Madras; but as the French gradually rallied, the fire upon the English was so heavy that the sortie was repulsed, with a loss of two hundred soldiers and six officers killed, wounded, and prisoners.</s> <s sid="59" id="clive.c26.s59">The French loss had been about the same.</s> <s sid="60" id="clive.c26.s60">Had not a large quantity of the French troops broken into the wine stores on their arrival, and drunk to a point of intoxication, it is probable that none of the British party would have returned to the fort.</s> <s sid="61" id="clive.c26.s61">The sortie had, however, the effect that Saubinet, one of the best of the French officers, was killed, and Count D'Estaign, an able general, taken prisoner.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="clive.c26.p17"><s sid="62" id="clive.c26.s62">For some time, the siege proceeded slowly, the French waiting for the arrival of their siege artillery, by ship, from Pondicherry.</s> <s sid="63" id="clive.c26.s63">The fort of Madras was now a far more formidable post than it had been when the French before captured it.</s> <s sid="64" id="clive.c26.s64">In the year 1743 Mr. Smith, an engineer, had marked out the lines for a considerable increase in the fortifications.</s> <s sid="65" id="clive.c26.s65">The ditch was dug and faced with brick, but on account of the expense, nothing further had been done.</s> <s sid="66" id="clive.c26.s66">The French had added somewhat to the fortifications during their stay there in 1750.</s> <s sid="67" id="clive.c26.s67">Nothing had been done by the English when they recovered the town, until the news of the preparations which the French were making for the siege of the place had been received.</s> <s sid="68" id="clive.c26.s68">Four thousand natives were then set to work; and these, in eighteen months, had completed the fortifications, as designed by Mr. Smith, just before the arrival of the French.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="clive.c26.p18"><s sid="69" id="clive.c26.s69">The latter determined to attack from the northern side.</s> <s sid="70" id="clive.c26.s70">Here the fort was protected by a demi-bastion, next to the sea; and by the Royal Bastion, the wall between the two being covered by a work known as the North Ravelin.</s> <s sid="71" id="clive.c26.s71">The defence was also strengthened by the fire of the northwest lunette, and Pigot's Bastion.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="clive.c26.p19"><s sid="72" id="clive.c26.s72">Against these the French threw up four batteries.</s> <s sid="73" id="clive.c26.s73">Lally's Battery, erected by the regiment of that name, was on the seashore directly facing the demi-bastion.</s> <s sid="74" id="clive.c26.s74">To its right was the Burying Ground Battery, facing the Royal Bastion.</s> <s sid="75" id="clive.c26.s75">Against the western face of this position the French regiment of Lorraine erected a strong work, while farther round to the west, on a rising ground, they threw up a battery called the Hospital Battery, which kept up a crossfire on the English position.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="clive.c26.p20"><s sid="76" id="clive.c26.s76">To prevent the French from pressing forward along the strip of shore between the fort and the sea, the English erected a strong stockade, behind which was a battery called the Fascine Battery.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="clive.c26.p21"><s sid="77" id="clive.c26.s77">A few days after the siege began, it was found that the numbers crowded up in the fort could scarcely be accommodated; and the rajah was, therefore, invited to leave by sea, on board a ship which would land him at the Dutch settlement of Negapatam, whence he might journey through the Tanjore country to Trichinopoli.</s> <s sid="78" id="clive.c26.s78">This proposal he willingly accepted, and embarked with his wife, women, and children, his other followers leaving by the land side, opposite to that invested by the French.</s> <s sid="79" id="clive.c26.s79">Thus the garrison were relieved of the embarrassment, and consumption of food, caused by four hundred men and two hundred horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="clive.c26.p22"><s sid="80" id="clive.c26.s80">Charlie rode, with his troop, without interruption through the country, avoiding all bodies of the enemy until he reached the sea, fifteen miles north of Madras.</s> <s sid="81" id="clive.c26.s81">Here he hired a native boat and, leaving the troops under the command of Ensign Anstey, sailed for Madras; in order to inform the garrison of Forde's victory over the French, and to concert, with the governor, as to the measures which he wished him to carry out to harass the enemy.</s> <s sid="82" id="clive.c26.s82">He was accompanied only by Tim and Hossein.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="clive.c26.p23"><s sid="83" id="clive.c26.s83">The wind was fair and, starting an hour before sunset, the boat ran into Madras roads two hours later.</s> <s sid="84" id="clive.c26.s84">The Harlem, which had that day arrived with artillery for the French from Pondicherry, fired at the little craft; and the native boatmen were about to turn the head of the craft northward again.</s> <s sid="85" id="clive.c26.s85">Charlie, however, drew his pistol, and Hossein took his place with his drawn tulwar by the helmsman.</s> <s sid="86" id="clive.c26.s86">The boatmen, thereupon, again continued their course; and, though several shots fell near them, they escaped untouched, and anchored just outside the surf, abreast of the fort.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="clive.c26.p24"><s sid="87" id="clive.c26.s87">The English had taken the precaution of erecting a number of huts under the walls of the fort for the boatmen, in order to be able to communicate with any ship arriving, or to send messages in or out.</s> <s sid="88" id="clive.c26.s88">As soon as the boat anchored, a catamaran put out, and brought Charlie and his followers to shore.</s> <s sid="89" id="clive.c26.s89">There was great joy at the receipt of his news, and the guns of the fort fired twenty-one shots towards the enemy, in honor of the victory.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="clive.c26.p25"><s sid="90" id="clive.c26.s90">Governor Pigot was in general command of the defence, having under him Colonel Lawrence, in command of the troops.</s> <s sid="91" id="clive.c26.s91">The latter, after inquiring from Charlie the character of the officer he had left in command of his troop, and finding that he was able and energetic, requested Charlie to send orders to him to join either the force under Captain Preston, at Chingalpatt, or that of a native leader, Mahomed Issoof, both of whom were ravaging and destroying the country about Conjeveram, whence the French besieging Madras drew most of their provisions.</s> <s sid="92" id="clive.c26.s92">Charlie himself was requested to remain in the fort, where his experience in sieges would render him of great value.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="clive.c26.p26"><s sid="93" id="clive.c26.s93">At daybreak on the 2nd of January, the Lorraine and Lally Batteries opened fire.</s> <s sid="94" id="clive.c26.s94">The English guns, however, proved superior in weight and number, dismounted two of the cannon, and silenced the others.</s> <s sid="95" id="clive.c26.s95">The French mortars continued to throw heavy shell into the fort, and that night most of the European women and children were sent away, in native boats.</s> <s sid="96" id="clive.c26.s96">The French batteries, finding the superiority of the English fire, ceased firing until the 6th, when seven guns and six large mortars from Lally's Battery, and eight guns and two mortars from the Lorraine Battery, opened upon the town.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="clive.c26.p27"><s sid="97" id="clive.c26.s97">The cannonade now continued without intermission, but the enemy gained but little advantage.</s> <s sid="98" id="clive.c26.s98">Every day, however, added to their strength, as fresh vessels with artillery continued to arrive from Pondicherry.</s> <s sid="99" id="clive.c26.s99">They were now pushing their approaches from Lally's Battery towards the demi-bastion.</s> <s sid="100" id="clive.c26.s100">The losses on the part of the besieged were considerable, many being killed and wounded each day.</s> <s sid="101" id="clive.c26.s101">This continued to the end of the month, in spite of many gallant sorties by parties of the besiegers, who repeatedly killed and drove out the working parties in the head of the French trenches.</s> <s sid="102" id="clive.c26.s102">These progressed steadily, and reached to the outworks of the demi-bastion.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="clive.c26.p28"><s sid="103" id="clive.c26.s103">On the 25th the Shaftesbury, one of the Company's trading vessels, commanded by Captain Inglis, was seen approaching.</s> <s sid="104" id="clive.c26.s104">The five French ships hoisted English colours.</s> <s sid="105" id="clive.c26.s105">A catamaran was sent out to warn her, and at nine o'clock in the evening she came to anchor.</s> <s sid="106" id="clive.c26.s106">She had on board only some invalids, but brought the welcome news that three other ships, with troops, would soon be up.</s> <s sid="107" id="clive.c26.s107">She had on board, too, thirty-seven chests of silver, and many military stores, among them hand grenades and large shell, which were most welcome to the garrison, who had nearly expended their supply.</s> <s sid="108" id="clive.c26.s108">The native boats went off from the fort, and brought on shore the ammunition and stores.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="clive.c26.p29"><s sid="109" id="clive.c26.s109">In the afternoon the Shaftesbury was attacked by the two French ships, the Bristol and the Harlem.</s> <s sid="110" id="clive.c26.s110">She fought them for two hours, and then sailed in and anchored again near the fort.</s> <s sid="111" id="clive.c26.s111">The French ships lay off at a distance, and these and one of their batteries played upon the Shaftesbury after she had anchored, and continued to do so for the next three days.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="clive.c26.p30"><s sid="112" id="clive.c26.s112">Many of the guns of the fort were dismounted by the artillery fire, which had continued, with scarcely any intermission, for a month.</s> <s sid="113" id="clive.c26.s113">The parapets of the ramparts were in many places beaten down, and the walls exposed to the enemy's fire greatly damaged.</s> <s sid="114" id="clive.c26.s114">The enemy now opened their breaching battery close to the works, and on the 7th two breaches had been effected, and Lally ordered his principal engineer and artillery officers to give their opinion as to the practicability of an assault.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="clive.c26.p31"><s sid="115" id="clive.c26.s115">These, however, considered that the assault would have no prospect of success, as the guns commanding the ditch were still uninjured, and the palisades which stormers must climb over before reaching the breach untouched.</s> <s sid="116" id="clive.c26.s116">So heavy a crossfire could be brought to bear by the besieged upon an assaulting column, that it would be swept away before it could mount the breach.</s> <s sid="117" id="clive.c26.s117">These officers added their opinion that, considering the number of men defending the fort in comparison with those attacking it, final success could not be looked for, and further prosecution of the works would only entail a useless loss of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="clive.c26.p32"><s sid="118" id="clive.c26.s118">On the 9th of February, the French attacked Mahomed Issoof's men and those of Captain Preston; the whole under the command of Major Calliaud, who had come up from Trichinopoli, and had taken station three miles in rear of the French position.</s> <s sid="119" id="clive.c26.s119">The greater part of the natives, as usual, behaved badly; but Calliaud, with the artillery and a few Sepoys, defended himself till nightfall; and then drew off.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="clive.c26.p33"><s sid="120" id="clive.c26.s120">For the next week the French continued to fire, and their approaches were pushed on.</s> <s sid="121" id="clive.c26.s121">Several sorties were made, but matters remained unchanged until the 14th, when six English ships were seen standing into the roads; and that night the French drew out from their trenches, and retreated.</s> <s sid="122" id="clive.c26.s122">The next morning six hundred troops landed from the ships, and the garrison, who had so stoutly resisted the assaults made upon them for forty-two days, sallied out to inspect the enemy's works.</s> <s sid="123" id="clive.c26.s123">Fifty-two cannon were left in them, and so great was the hurry with which the French retreated that they left forty-four sick in the hospital behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="clive.c26.p34"><s sid="124" id="clive.c26.s124">The fort fired, during the siege, 26,554 rounds from their cannon, 7502 shells, threw 1990 hand grenades, and expended 200,000 musketry cartridges.</s> <s sid="125" id="clive.c26.s125">Thirty pieces of cannon and five mortars had been dismounted during the siege.</s> <s sid="126" id="clive.c26.s126">Of the Europeans, the loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners was five hundred and seventy-nine.</s> <s sid="127" id="clive.c26.s127">Three hundred and twenty-two Sepoys were killed and wounded, and four hundred and forty deserted during the siege.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="clive.c26.p35"><s sid="128" id="clive.c26.s128">In spite of the resolution with which the French had pushed the siege, it was, from the first, destined to failure.</s> <s sid="129" id="clive.c26.s129">The garrison were well provisioned, had great stores of ammunition, and plenty of spare cannon to replace those disabled or dismounted.</s> <s sid="130" id="clive.c26.s130">The works were strong, and the garrison not greatly inferior in number to the besiegers.</s> <s sid="131" id="clive.c26.s131">The French, on the other hand, had to bring their artillery, ammunition, and stores by water from Pondicherry; and the activity of the English parties in their rear rendered it extremely difficult for them to receive supplies of food, by land.</s> <s sid="132" id="clive.c26.s132">Lally had disgusted even the French officers and soldiers by his arrogance, and passionate temper; while by the Sepoys he was absolutely hated.</s> </p>
