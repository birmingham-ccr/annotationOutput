<title>CHAPTER I. SIR BEVIS.</title>
<p pid="1" id="woodmagic.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="woodmagic.c1.s1">One morning as little "Sir" Bevis [such was his pet name] was digging in the farmhouse garden, he saw a daisy, and throwing aside his spade, he sat down on the grass to pick the flower to pieces.</s> <s sid="2" id="woodmagic.c1.s2">He pulled the pink-tipped petals off one by one, and as they dropped they were lost.</s> <s sid="3" id="woodmagic.c1.s3">Next he gathered a bright dandelion, and squeezed the white juice from the hollow stem, which drying presently, left his fingers stained with brown spots.</s> <s sid="4" id="woodmagic.c1.s4">Then he drew forth a bennet from its sheath, and bit and sucked it till his teeth were green from the sap.</s> <s sid="5" id="woodmagic.c1.s5">Lying at full length, he drummed the earth with his toes, while the tall grass blades tickled his cheeks.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c1.p2"><s sid="6" id="woodmagic.c1.s6">Presently, rolling on his back, he drummed again with his heels.</s> <s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c1.s7">He looked up at the blue sky, but only for a moment, because the glare of light was too strong in his eyes.</s> <s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c1.s8">After a minute, he turned on his side, thrust out one arm, placed his head on it, and drew up one knee, as if going to sleep.</s> <s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c1.s9">His little brown wrist, bared by the sleeve shortening as he extended his arm, bent down the grass, and his still browner fingers played with the blades, and every now and then tore one off.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c1.s10">A flutter of wings sounded among the blossom on an apple-tree close by, and instantly Bevis sat up, knowing it must be a goldfinch thinking of building a nest in the branches.</s> <s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c1.s11">If the trunk of the tree had not been so big, he would have tried to climb it at once, but he knew he could not do it, nor could he see the bird for the leaves and bloom.</s> <s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c1.s12">A puff of wind came and showered the petals down upon him; they fell like snowflakes on his face and dotted the grass.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="woodmagic.c1.p4"><s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c1.s13">Buzz!</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c1.s14">A great bumble-bee, with a band of red gold across his back, flew up, and hovered near, wavering to and fro in the air as he stayed to look at a flower.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="woodmagic.c1.p5"><s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c1.s15">Buzz!</s> <s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c1.s16">Bevis listened, and knew very well what he was saying.</s> <s sid="17" id="woodmagic.c1.s17">It was:</s> <s sid="18" id="woodmagic.c1.s18">"This is a sweet little garden, my darling; a very pleasant garden; all grass and daisies, and apple-trees, and narrow patches with flowers and fruit-trees one side, and a wall and currant-bushes another side, and a low box-hedge and a haha, where you can see the high mowing grass quite underneath you; and a round summer-house in the corner, painted as blue inside as a hedge-sparrow's egg is outside; and then another haha with iron railings, which you are always climbing up, Bevis, on the fourth side, with stone steps leading down to a meadow, where the cows are feeding, and where they have left all the buttercups standing as tall as your waist, sir.</s> <s sid="19" id="woodmagic.c1.s19">The gate in the iron railings is not fastened, and besides, there is a gap in the box-hedge, and it is easy to drop down the haha wall, but that is mowing grass there.</s> <s sid="20" id="woodmagic.c1.s20">You know very well you could not come to any harm in the meadow; they said you were not to go outside the garden, but that's all nonsense, and very stupid.</s> <s sid="21" id="woodmagic.c1.s21">_I_ am going outside the garden, Bevis.</s> <s sid="22" id="woodmagic.c1.s22">Good-morning, dear."</s> <s sid="23" id="woodmagic.c1.s23">Buzz!</s> <s sid="24" id="woodmagic.c1.s24">And the great bumble-bee flew slowly between the iron railings, out among the buttercups, and away up the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="woodmagic.c1.p6"><s sid="25" id="woodmagic.c1.s25">Bevis went to the railings, and stood on the lowest bar; then he opened the gate a little way, but it squeaked so loud upon its rusty hinges that he let it shut again.</s> <s sid="26" id="woodmagic.c1.s26">He walked round the garden along beside the box-hedge to the patch by the lilac trees; they were single lilacs, which are much more beautiful than the double, and all bowed down with a mass of bloom.</s> <s sid="27" id="woodmagic.c1.s27">Some rhubarb grew there, and to bring it up the faster, they had put a round wooden box on it, hollowed out from the sawn butt of an elm, which was rotten within and easily scooped.</s> <s sid="28" id="woodmagic.c1.s28">The top was covered with an old board, and every time that Bevis passed he lifted up the corner of the board and peeped in, to see if the large red, swelling knobs were yet bursting.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c1.p7"><s sid="29" id="woodmagic.c1.s29">One of these round wooden boxes had been split and spoilt, and half of it was left lying with the hollow part downwards.</s> <s sid="30" id="woodmagic.c1.s30">Under this shelter a toad had his house.</s> <s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c1.s31">Bevis peered in at him, and touched him with a twig to make him move an inch or two, for he was so lazy, and sat there all day long, except when it rained.</s> <s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c1.s32">Sometimes the toad told him a story, but not very often, for he was a silent old philosopher, and not very fond of anybody.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c1.s33">He had a nephew, quite a lively young fellow, in the cucumber frame on the other side of the lilac bushes, at whom Bevis also peered nearly every day after they had lifted the frame and propped it up with wedges.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="woodmagic.c1.p8"><s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c1.s34">The gooseberries were no bigger than beads, but he tasted two, and then a thrush began to sing on an ash-tree in the hedge of the meadow.</s> <s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c1.s35">"Bevis!</s> <s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c1.s36">Bevis!" said the thrush, and he turned round to listen:</s> <s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c1.s37">"My dearest Bevis, have you forgotten the meadow, and the buttercups, and the sorrel?</s> <s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c1.s38">You know the sorrel, don't you, that tastes so pleasant if you nibble the leaf?</s> <s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c1.s39">And I have a nest in the bushes, not very far up the hedge, and you may take just one egg; there are only two yet.</s> <s sid="40" id="woodmagic.c1.s40">But don't tell any more boys about it, or we shall not have one left.</s> <s sid="41" id="woodmagic.c1.s41">That is a very sweet garden, but it is very small.</s> <s sid="42" id="woodmagic.c1.s42">I like all these fields to fly about in, and the swallows fly ever so much farther than I can; so far away and so high, that I cannot tell you how they find their way home to the chimney.</s> <s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c1.s43">But they will tell you, if you ask them.</s> <s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c1.s44">Good-morning!</s> <s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c1.s45">I am going over the brook."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c1.p9"><s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c1.s46">Bevis went to the iron railings and got up two bars, and looked over; but he could not yet make up his mind, so he went inside the summer-house, which had one small round window.</s> <s sid="47" id="woodmagic.c1.s47">All the lower part of the blue walls was scribbled and marked with pencil, where he had written and drawn, and put down his ideas and notes.</s> <s sid="48" id="woodmagic.c1.s48">The lines were somewhat intermingled, and crossed each other, and some stretched out long distances, and came back in sharp angles.</s> <s sid="49" id="woodmagic.c1.s49">But Bevis knew very well what he meant when he wrote it all.</s> <s sid="50" id="woodmagic.c1.s50">Taking a stump of cedar pencil from his pocket, one end of it much gnawn, he added a few scrawls to the inscriptions, and then stood on the seat to look out of the round window, which was darkened by an old cobweb.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c1.p10"><s sid="51" id="woodmagic.c1.s51">Once upon a time there was a very cunning spider--a very cunning spider indeed.</s> <s sid="52" id="woodmagic.c1.s52">The old toad by the rhubarb told Bevis there had not been such a cunning spider for many summers; he knew almost as much about flies as the old toad, and caught such a great number, that the toad began to think there would be none left for him.</s> <s sid="53" id="woodmagic.c1.s53">Now the toad was extremely fond of flies, and he watched the spider with envy, and grew more angry about it every day.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="woodmagic.c1.p11"><s sid="54" id="woodmagic.c1.s54">As he sat blinking and winking by the rhubarb in his house all day long, the toad never left off thinking, thinking, thinking about the spider.</s> <s sid="55" id="woodmagic.c1.s55">And as he kept thinking, thinking, thinking, so he told Bevis, he recollected that he knew a great deal about a good many other things besides flies.</s> <s sid="56" id="woodmagic.c1.s56">So one day, after several weeks of thinking, he crawled out of his house in the sunshine, which he did not like at all, and went across the grass to the iron railings, where the spider had then got his web.</s> <s sid="57" id="woodmagic.c1.s57">The spider saw him coming, and being very proud of his cleverness, began to taunt and tease him.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c1.p12"><s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c1.s58">"Your back is all over warts, and you are an old toad," he said.</s> <s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c1.s59">"You are so old, that I heard the swallows saying their great-great-great-grandmothers, when they built in the chimney, did not know when you were born.</s> <s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c1.s60">And you have got foolish, and past doing anything, and so stupid that you hardly know when it is going to rain.</s> <s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c1.s61">Why, the sun is shining bright, you stupid old toad, and there isn't a chance of a single drop falling.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c1.s62">You look very ugly down there in the grass.</s> <s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c1.s63">Now, don't you wish that you were me and could catch more flies than you could eat?</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c1.s64">Why, I can catch wasps and bees, and tie them up so tight with my threads that they cannot sting nor even move their wings, nor so much as wriggle their bodies.</s> <s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c1.s65">I am the very cleverest and most cunning spider that ever lived."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="woodmagic.c1.p13"><s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c1.s66">"Indeed, you are," replied the toad.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c1.s67">"I have been thinking so all the summer; and so much do I admire you, that I have come all this way, across in the hot sun, to tell you something."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="woodmagic.c1.p14"><s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c1.s68">"Tell _me_ something!" said the spider, much offended, "_I_ know everything."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="woodmagic.c1.p15"><s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c1.s69">"Oh, yes, honoured sir," said the toad; "you have such wonderful eyes, and such a sharp mind, it is true that you know everything about the sun, and the moon, and the earth, and flies.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c1.s70">But, as you have studied all these great and important things, you could hardly see all the very little trifles like a poor old toad."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="woodmagic.c1.p16"><s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c1.s71">"Oh, yes, I can.</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c1.s72">I know everything--everything!"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c1.p17"><s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c1.s73">"But, sir," went on the toad so humbly, "this is such a little--such a very little--thing, and a spider like you, in such a high position of life, could not mind me telling you such a mere nothing."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c1.p18"><s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c1.s74">"Well, I don't mind," said the spider--"you may go on, and tell me, if you like."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c1.p19"><s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c1.s75">"The fact is," said the toad, "while I have been sitting in my hole, I have noticed that such a lot of the flies that come into this garden presently go into the summer-house there, and when they are in the summer-house, they always go to that little round window, which is sometimes quite black with them; for it is the nature of flies to buzz over glass."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="woodmagic.c1.p20"><s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c1.s76">"I do not know so much about that," said the spider; "for I have never lived in houses, being an independent insect; but it is possible you may be right.</s> <s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c1.s77">At any rate, it is not of much consequence.</s> <s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c1.s78">You had better go up into the window, old toad."</s> <s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c1.s79">Now this was a sneer on the part of the spider.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="woodmagic.c1.p21"><s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c1.s80">"But I can't climb up into the window," said the toad; "all I can do is to crawl about the ground, but you can run up a wall quickly.</s> <s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c1.s81">How I do wish I was a spider, like you.</s> <s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c1.s82">Oh, dear!"</s> <s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c1.s83">And then the toad turned round, after bowing to the clever spider, and went back to his hole.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="woodmagic.c1.p22"><s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c1.s84">Now the spider was secretly very much mortified and angry with himself, because he had not noticed this about the flies going to the window in the summer-house.</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c1.s85">At first he said to himself that it was not true; but he could not help looking that way now and then, and every time he looked, there was the window crowded with flies.</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c1.s86">They had all the garden to buzz about in, and all the fields, but instead of wandering under the trees, and over the flowers, they preferred to go into the summer-house and crawl over the glass of the little window, though it was very dirty from so many feet.</s> <s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c1.s87">For a long time, the spider was too proud to go there too; but one day such a splendid blue-bottle fly got in the window and made such a tremendous buzzing, that he could not resist it any more.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="woodmagic.c1.p23"><s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c1.s88">So he left his web by the railings, and climbed up the blue-painted wall, over Bevis's writings and marks, and spun such a web in the window as had never before been seen.</s> <s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c1.s89">It was the largest and the finest, and the most beautifully-arranged web that had ever been made, and it caught such a number of flies that the spider grew fatter every day.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c1.s90">In a week's time he was so big that he could no longer hide in the crack he had chosen, he was quite a giant; and the toad came across the grass one night and looked at him, but the spider was now so bloated he would not recognise the toad.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="woodmagic.c1.p24"><s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c1.s91">But one morning a robin came to the iron railings, and perched on the top, and put his head a little on one side, to show his black eye the better.</s> <s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c1.s92">Then he flew inside the summer-house, alighted in the window, and gobbled up the spider in an instant.</s> <s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c1.s93">The old toad shut his eye and opened it again, and went on thinking, for that was just what he knew would happen.</s> <s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c1.s94">Ever so many times in his very long life he had seen spiders go up there, but no sooner had they got fat than a robin or a wren came in and ate them.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c1.s95">Some of the clever spider's web was there still when Bevis looked out of the window, all dusty and draggled, with the skins and wings of some gnats and a dead leaf entangled in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="woodmagic.c1.p25"><s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c1.s96">As he looked, a white butterfly came along the meadow, and instantly he ran out, flung open the gate, rushed down the steps, and taking no heed of the squeak the gate made as it shut behind him, raced after the butterfly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c1.p26"><s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c1.s97">The tall buttercups brushed his knees, and bent on either side as if a wind was rushing through them.</s> <s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c1.s98">A bennet slipped up his knickerbockers and tickled his leg.</s> <s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c1.s99">His toes only touched the ground, neither his heels nor the hollow of his foot; and from so light a pressure the grass, bowed but not crushed, rose up, leaving no more mark of his passage than if a grasshopper had gone by.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="woodmagic.c1.p27"><s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c1.s100">Daintily fanning himself with his wings, the butterfly went before Bevis, not yet knowing that he was chased, but sauntering along just above the buttercups.</s> <s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c1.s101">He peeped as he flew under the lids of the flowers' eyes, to see if any of them loved him.</s> <s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c1.s102">There was a glossy green leaf which he thought he should like to feel, it looked so soft and satin-like.</s> <s sid="103" id="woodmagic.c1.s103">So he alighted on it, and then saw Bevis coming, his hat on the very back of his head, and his hand stretched out to catch him.</s> <s sid="104" id="woodmagic.c1.s104">The butterfly wheeled himself round on the leaf, shut up his wings, and seemed so innocent, till Bevis fell on his knee, and then under his fingers there was nothing but the leaf.</s> <s sid="105" id="woodmagic.c1.s105">His cheek flushed, his eye lit up, and away he darted again after the butterfly, which had got several yards ahead before he could recover himself.</s> <s sid="106" id="woodmagic.c1.s106">He ran now faster than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="woodmagic.c1.p28"><s sid="107" id="woodmagic.c1.s107">"Race on," said the buttercups; "race on, Bevis; that butterfly disdains us because we are so many, and all alike."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="woodmagic.c1.p29"><s sid="108" id="woodmagic.c1.s108">"Be quick," said a great moon-daisy to him; "catch him, dear.</s> <s sid="109" id="woodmagic.c1.s109">I asked him to stay and tell me a story, but he would not."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="woodmagic.c1.p30"><s sid="110" id="woodmagic.c1.s110">"Never mind me," said the clover; "you may step on me if you like, love."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c1.p31"><s sid="111" id="woodmagic.c1.s111">"But just look at me for a moment, pet, as you go by," cried the purple vetch by the hedge.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="woodmagic.c1.p32"><s sid="112" id="woodmagic.c1.s112">A colt in the field, seeing Bevis running so fast, thought he too must join the fun, so he whisked his tail, stretched his long floundering legs, and galloped away.</s> <s sid="113" id="woodmagic.c1.s113">Then the mare whinnied and galloped too, and the ground shook under her heavy hoofs.</s> <s sid="114" id="woodmagic.c1.s114">The cows lifted their heads from gathering the grass close round the slender bennets, and wondered why any one could be so foolish as to rush about, when there was plenty to eat and no hurry.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="woodmagic.c1.p33"><s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c1.s115">The cunning deceitful butterfly, so soon as Bevis came near, turned aside and went along a furrow.</s> <s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c1.s116">Bevis, running in the furrow, caught his foot in the long creepers of the crowfoot, and fell down bump, and pricked his hand with a thistle.</s> <s sid="117" id="woodmagic.c1.s117">Up he jumped again, red as a peony, and shouting in his rage, ran on so quickly that he nearly overtook the butterfly.</s> <s sid="118" id="woodmagic.c1.s118">But they were now nearer the other hedge.</s> <s sid="119" id="woodmagic.c1.s119">The butterfly, frightened at the shouting and Bevis's resolution, rose over the brambles, and Bevis stopping short flung his hat at him.</s> <s sid="120" id="woodmagic.c1.s120">The hat did not hit the butterfly, but the wind it made puffed him round, and so frightened him, that he flew up half as high as the elms, and went into the next field.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="woodmagic.c1.p34"><s sid="121" id="woodmagic.c1.s121">When Bevis looked down, there was his hat, hung on a branch of ash, far beyond his reach.</s> <s sid="122" id="woodmagic.c1.s122">He could not touch the lowest leaf, jump as much as he would.</s> <s sid="123" id="woodmagic.c1.s123">His next thought was a stone to throw, but there were none in the meadow.</s> <s sid="124" id="woodmagic.c1.s124">Then he put his hand in his jacket pocket for his knife, to cut a long stick.</s> <s sid="125" id="woodmagic.c1.s125">It was not in that pocket, nor in the one on the other side, nor in his knickers.</s> <s sid="126" id="woodmagic.c1.s126">Now the knife was Bevis's greatest treasure--his very greatest.</s> <s sid="127" id="woodmagic.c1.s127">He looked all round bewildered, and the tears rose in his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="woodmagic.c1.p35"><s sid="128" id="woodmagic.c1.s128">Just then Pan, the spaniel, who had worked his head loose from the collar and followed him, ran out of the hedge between Bevis's legs with such joyful force, that Bevis was almost overthrown, and burst into a fit of laughter.</s> <s sid="129" id="woodmagic.c1.s129">Pan ran back into the hedge to hunt, and Bevis, with tears rolling down his cheeks into the dimples made by his smiles, dropped on hands and knees and crept in after the dog under the briars.</s> <s sid="130" id="woodmagic.c1.s130">On the bank there was a dead grey stick, a branch that had fallen from the elms.</s> <s sid="131" id="woodmagic.c1.s131">It was heavy, but Bevis heaved it up, and pushed it through the boughs and thrust his hat off.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c2.p3"><s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c2.s11">First they thought of the brook, lest he should have walked in among the flags that were coming up so green and strong.</s> <s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c2.s12">Then they thought of the tallet over the stable,--perhaps he had climbed up there again from the manger, over the heads of the great cart-horses, quietly eating their hay, while he put his foot on the manger and then on the projecting steps in the corner, and into the hayrack--and so up.</s> <s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c2.s13">He had done it once before, and could not get down, and so the tallet was searched.</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c2.s14">One man was sent to the Long Pond, with orders to look everywhere, and borrow the punt and push in among the bulrushes.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="woodmagic.c2.p4"><s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c2.s15">Another was despatched to the Close, to gruffly inquire where the cottage boys were, and what they had been doing, for Bevis was known to hanker after their company, to go catching loach under the stones in the stream that crossed the road, and creeping under the arch of the bridge, and taking the moor-hens' eggs from the banks of the ponds where the rushes were thick.</s> <s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c2.s16">Another was put on the pony, to gallop up the road after the carter and his waggon, for he had set off that morning with a load of hay for the hills that could be seen to the southward.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="woodmagic.c2.p5"><s sid="17" id="woodmagic.c2.s17">Running over every possible thing that Bevis could have done in his mind, his papa remembered that he had lately taken to asking about the road, and would not be satisfied till they had taken him up to the sign-post--a mile beyond the village, and explained the meaning of it.</s> <s sid="18" id="woodmagic.c2.s18">Some one had told him that it was the road to Southampton--the place where the ships came.</s> <s sid="19" id="woodmagic.c2.s19">Now, Bevis was full of the ships, drawing them on the blue wall of the summer-house, and floating a boat on the trough in the cow-yard, and looking wistfully up the broad dusty highway, as if he could see the masts and yards sixty miles away or more.</s> <s sid="20" id="woodmagic.c2.s20">Perhaps when the carter went with the waggon that way, Bevis had slipped up the footpath that made a short cut across the fields, and joined the waggon at the cross-roads, that he might ride to the hills thinking to see the sea on the other side.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="woodmagic.c2.p6"><s sid="21" id="woodmagic.c2.s21">And the bailiff, not to be behindhand, having just come in for his lunch, ran out again without so much as wetting his stubbly white beard in the froth of the drawn quart of ale, and made away as fast as his stiff legs could carry him to where there was a steam ploughing engine at work--a mile distant.</s> <s sid="22" id="woodmagic.c2.s22">The sight of the white steam, and the humming of the fly-wheel, always set Bevis "on the jig," as the village folk called it, to get to the machinery, and the smell of the cotton waste and oil wafted on the wind was to him like the scent of battle to the war-horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c2.p7"><s sid="23" id="woodmagic.c2.s23">But Bevis was not in the tallet, nor the brook, nor among the bulrushes of the Long Pond, nor under the bridge dabbling for loach, nor watching the steam plough, and the cottage boys swore their hardest (and they knew how to swear quite properly) that they had not seen him that morning.</s> <s sid="24" id="woodmagic.c2.s24">But they would look for him, and forthwith eagerly started to scour the fields and hedges.</s> <s sid="25" id="woodmagic.c2.s25">Meantime, Bevis, quite happy, was sleeping under the oak in the shadow, with Pan every now and then coming out of the rabbit-hole to snort out the sand that got into his nostrils.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c2.p9"><s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c2.s31">The bailiff turned the collar over thoughtfully with his foot, and felt his scanty white beard with his hard hand; and then he went back to the cart-house.</s> <s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c2.s32">Up in the cart-house, on the ledge of the wall beneath the thatch, there were three or four sticks, each about four feet long and as thick as your thumb, with the bark on--some were ground ash, some crab-tree, and one was hazel.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c2.s33">This one was straight and as hard as could be.</s> <s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c2.s34">These sticks were put there for the time when the cows were moved, so that the men might find their sticks quick.</s> <s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c2.s35">Each had his stick, and the bailiff's was the hazel one.</s> <s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c2.s36">With the staff in his hand the bailiff set out straight across the grass, looking neither to the right nor the left, but walking deliberately and without hesitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c2.p10"><s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c2.s37">He got through a gap in one hedge, and then he turned to the corner making towards the rabbit-burrows, for he guessed that Pan had gone there.</s> <s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c2.s38">As he approached he saw Bevis sleeping, and smiled, for looking for the dog he had found the boy.</s> <s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c2.s39">But first stepping softly up to Bevis, and seeing that he was quite right and unhurt, only asleep, the bailiff went to the hedge and thrust his staff into the hole where Pan was at work.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c2.p12"><s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c2.s43">Bevis battled hard for his dog, but the bailiff had had his lunch delayed, and his peace of mind upset about the boy, and he was resolutely relieving himself upon the spaniel.</s> <s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c2.s44">Now the hazel rod, being dry and stiff, was like a bar of iron, and did not yield or bend in the least, but made the spaniel's ribs rattle.</s> <s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c2.s45">Pan could not get low enough into the grass; he ceased to howl, so great was the pain, but merely whimpered, and the tears filled his brown eyes.</s> <s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c2.s46">At last the bailiff ceased, and immediately Bevis pulled out his handkerchief, and sat down on the grass and wiped away the spaniel's tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c2.p17"><s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c2.s58">There were the last fragments of the great box of wooden bricks, cut and chipped, and notched and splintered by that treasure, his pocket-knife.</s> <s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c2.s59">There was the tin box for the paste, or the worms in moss, when he went fishing.</s> <s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c2.s60">There was the wheel of his old wheelbarrow, long since smashed and numbered with the Noah's arks that have gone the usual way.</s> <s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c2.s61">There was the brazen cylinder of a miniature steam-engine bent out of all shape.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c2.s62">There was the hammer-head made specially for him by the blacksmith down in the village, without a handle, for people were tired of putting new handles to it, he broke them so quickly.</s> <s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c2.s63">There was a horse-shoe, and the iron catch of a gate, and besides these a boxwood top, which he could not spin, but which he had payed away half the savings in his money-box for, because he had seen it split the other boys' tops in the road.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c2.p18"><s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c2.s64">In one corner was a brass cannon, the touch-hole blackened by the explosion of gunpowder, and by it the lock of an ancient pistol--the lock only, and neither barrel nor handle.</s> <s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c2.s65">An old hunting-crop, some feathers from pheasants' tails, part of a mole-trap, an old brazen bugle, much battered, a wooden fig-box full of rusty nails, several scraps of deal board and stumps of cedar pencil were heaped together in confusion.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c2.s66">But these were not all, nor could any written inventory exhaust the contents, and give a perfect list of all that cupboard held.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c2.s67">There was always something new in it:</s> <s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c2.s68">Bevis never went there, but he found something.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c2.p19"><s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c2.s69">With the hunting-crop he followed the harriers and chased the doubling hare; with the cannon he fought battles, such as he saw in the pictures; the bugle, too, sounded the charge (the bailiff sometimes blew it in the garden to please him, and the hollow "who-oo!" it made echoed over the fields); with the deal boards and the rusty nails, and the hammer-head, he built houses, and even cities.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c2.s70">The jagged and splintered wooden bricks, six inches long, were not bricks, but great beams and baulks of timber; the wheel of the wheelbarrow was the centre of many curious pieces of mechanism.</s> <s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c2.s71">He could see these things easily.</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c2.s72">So he sat down at his cupboard and forgot the lecture instantly; the pout disappeared from his lips as he plunged his hand into the inexhaustible cupboard.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="woodmagic.c2.p36"><s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c2.s115">"And you frightened my mother," said Bevis, "by running across her bed in the night;" and he began to press on the spring of the gin.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="woodmagic.c2.p37"><s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c2.s116">"Yes, that he did," said the weasel, overjoyed; "and he made a hole in the boards of the floor, and it was down that hole that the half-sovereign rolled and was lost, and the poor maid-servant sent away because they thought she had stolen it."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="woodmagic.c2.p42"><s sid="132" id="woodmagic.c2.s132">Then a rook went over and cawed, and Bevis, looking up at the bird, caught a glimpse of the swing over the wall--it stood under the sycamore tree.</s> <s sid="133" id="woodmagic.c2.s133">Dropping the bit of apple, away he ran to the swing, and sat in it, and pushed himself off.</s> <s sid="134" id="woodmagic.c2.s134">As he swung forward he straightened his legs and leant back; when he swung back he drew his feet under him and leant forward, and by continuing this the weight of his body caused the swing to rise like a pendulum till he went up among the sycamore boughs, nearly as high as the ivy-grown roof of the summer-house, just opposite.</s> <s sid="135" id="woodmagic.c2.s135">There he went to and fro, as easily as possible, shutting his eyes and humming to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="woodmagic.c2.p48"><s sid="155" id="woodmagic.c2.s155">Immediately afterwards ten sparrows came from the house-top into the bushes, chattering and struggling all together, scratching, pecking, buffeting, and all talking at once.</s> <s sid="156" id="woodmagic.c2.s156">After they had had a good fight they all went back to the house-top, and began to tell each other what tremendous blows they had given.</s> <s sid="157" id="woodmagic.c2.s157">Then there was such a great cawing from the rook trees, which were a long way off, that it was evident a battle was going on there, and Bevis heard the chaffinch say that one of the rooks had been caught stealing his cousin's sticks.</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="woodmagic.c3.p97"><s sid="310" id="woodmagic.c3.s310">"Well," said the thrush, much relieved, "is that all? snails are very nice to eat."</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="woodmagic.c3.p98"><s sid="311" id="woodmagic.c3.s311">"Was it not brutally cruel?" asked the weasel.</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="woodmagic.c3.p111"><s sid="336" id="woodmagic.c3.s336">Bevis was very angry when he saw how the weasel had deceived him, and felt so sorry for the poor thrush, whose speckled breast was all pierced by the shot, and who would never sing any more.</s> <s sid="337" id="woodmagic.c3.s337">He did not know what to do, he was so cross; but presently he ran home to fetch Pan, to see if Pan could hunt out the weasel.</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="woodmagic.c3.p112"><s sid="338" id="woodmagic.c3.s338">When he had gone a little way the weasel came out of the hole, and went down into the ditch and feasted on the thrush's egg, which he could not have got had not the shot knocked the nest to pieces, just as he had contrived.</s> <s sid="339" id="woodmagic.c3.s339">He never tasted so sweet an egg as that one, and as he sucked it up he laughed as he thought how cleverly he had deceived them all.</s> <s sid="340" id="woodmagic.c3.s340">When he heard Pan bark he went back into the hole, and so along the hedge till he reached the copse; and then creeping into another hole, a very small one, where no dog could get at him, he curled himself up very comfortably and went to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="woodmagic.c7.p124"><s sid="303" id="woodmagic.c7.s303">"It is quite feasible, I am sure," said the crow; "especially if Prince Tchack-tchack continues his undutiful course, and if Choo Hoo should come up with his army."</s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="woodmagic.c7.p125"><s sid="304" id="woodmagic.c7.s304">"I must think about it," said Cloctaw; "we must not be too hasty."</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="woodmagic.c7.p127"><s sid="307" id="woodmagic.c7.s307">"Perfectly private," said Cloctaw; and they parted.</s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="woodmagic.c7.p130"><s sid="317" id="woodmagic.c7.s317">But Cloctaw turned a deaf ear to these kindly proposals, and could not be made to see the advantages so benevolently suggested.</s> <s sid="318" id="woodmagic.c7.s318">He would in no degree abate his dignity, his right, power, or position.</s> <s sid="319" id="woodmagic.c7.s319">He adhered to St.</s> <s sid="320" id="woodmagic.c7.s320">Paul.</s> <s sid="321" id="woodmagic.c7.s321">There he had built all his days, and there he meant to stay to the last, for having seen so much of the world, well he knew that possession is ten points of the law, and well he understood the envy and jealousy which dictated these friendly counsels.</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="woodmagic.c7.p136"><s sid="336" id="woodmagic.c7.s336">But the fact was the fox recollected that the mouse had had a long start, and it was very doubtful if the stoat could overtake him, and if he did, most likely the rat would come to meet his friend, and the stoat would get the worst of the encounter.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="woodmagic.c8.p44"><s sid="121" id="woodmagic.c8.s121">About the same time, it happened that a missel-thrush arrived at the court, a son of the favourite missel-thrush, the only bird whom Kapchack (and the farmer) allowed to build in the orchard.</s> <s sid="122" id="woodmagic.c8.s122">The missel-thrush had just travelled through part of the country which once belonged to Kapchack, but which Choo Hoo had over-run the year before, and he brought Kapchack such a terrible account of the mighty armies that he saw assembling, that the king was beside himself with terror.</s> <s sid="123" id="woodmagic.c8.s123">Next came a crow, one of Kauc's warriors, who had been that way, and he said that two captains of the wood-pigeons, hearing of the peewits' defeat, had already, and without staying for instructions from Choo Hoo, entered the country and taken possession of a copse on the slope of the hill from which the peewits had descended.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="woodmagic.c8.p48"><s sid="133" id="woodmagic.c8.s133">"Even their language, as you yourself have heard, is very contracted and poor, without inflection or expression, being nothing but the repetition of the same sounds, by which means--that is simply by the number and the depth of hollowness of the same monosyllables--they convey their wishes to each other.</s> <s sid="134" id="woodmagic.c8.s134">It is, indeed, wonderful how they can do so, and our learned men, from this circumstance, have held that the language of the wood-pigeon is the most difficult to acquire, so much so that it is scarce possible for one who has not been born among the barbarians to attain to any facility in the use of these gutturals.</s> <s sid="135" id="woodmagic.c8.s135">This is the reason why little or no intercourse has ever taken place between us who are civilised and these hordes; that which has gone on has been entirely conducted by the aid of interpreters, being those few wood-pigeons who have come away from the main body, and dwell peaceably in our midst.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="woodmagic.c8.p53"><s sid="150" id="woodmagic.c8.s150">"Finding himself in danger, Choo Hoo, not one whit abashed, instead of fleeing, came before the elders and openly reproached them with misgovernment, cowardice, and the concealment or loss of certain ancient prophecies, which foretold the future power of the wood-pigeons, and which he accused them of holding back out of jealousy, lest they should lose the miserable petty authority they enjoyed on account of their age.</s> <s sid="151" id="woodmagic.c8.s151">Now, whether there were really any such prophecies, I cannot tell you, or whether it was one of Choo Hoo's clever artifices, it is a moot point among our most learned antiquaries; the owl, who has the best means of information, told me once that he believed there was some ground for the assertion.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="woodmagic.c8.p59"><s sid="167" id="woodmagic.c8.s167">"But Choo Hoo, deeply distressed in mind, said that he would relieve them from the burden of his presence rather than thus be the cause of their sorrow.</s> <s sid="168" id="woodmagic.c8.s168">He therefore left those provinces and flew out of the country, leaving word behind him that he would never return till he had seen the raven, and recovered from him those ancient prophecies that had so long been lost.</s> <s sid="169" id="woodmagic.c8.s169">He flew away, and disappeared in the distance; the days and weeks passed, but he did not return, and at last Kapchack, relieved of his apprehensions, recalled his murderous troops, and the pigeons were left in peace to lament their Choo Hoo.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="woodmagic.c8.p60"><s sid="170" id="woodmagic.c8.s170">"A twelvemonth passed, and still Choo Hoo did not come; the people said he had been called to the happy Forest of the Heroes, and averred that sometimes they heard his voice calling to them when no one was near.</s> <s sid="171" id="woodmagic.c8.s171">There was no doubt that he had gone with the raven.</s> <s sid="172" id="woodmagic.c8.s172">The raven, you must know, my dear Sir Bevis, was once the principal judge and arbiter of justice amongst us, so much so that he was above kings, and it is certain that had he been here we should not have had to submit to the sanguinary tyranny of Kapchack, nor condemned to witness the scandalous behaviour of his court, or the still greater scandal of his own private life.</s> <s sid="173" id="woodmagic.c8.s173">But for some reason the raven mysteriously left this country about a hundred years ago, leaving behind him certain prophecies, some of which no doubt you have heard, especially that upon his return there will be no more famine, nor frost, nor slaughter, nor conflict, but we shall all live together in peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="woodmagic.c8.p61"><s sid="174" id="woodmagic.c8.s174">"However that may be, the raven has never come back; the learned hold that he must have died long since, for he was so aged when he went away no one knew his years, hinting in their disbelief that he went away to die, and so surround his death with a halo of mystery; but the common people are quite of a different opinion, and strenuously uphold the belief that he will some day return.</s> <s sid="175" id="woodmagic.c8.s175">Well, as I told you, a twelvemonth went by, and Choo Hoo did not come, when suddenly in the spring (when Kapchack himself was much occupied in his palace, and most of his spies were busy with their nests, and the matter had almost been forgotten) Choo Hoo reappeared, bringing with him the most beautiful young bride that was ever beheld, as he himself was, on the other hand, the strongest and swiftest of the wood-pigeons.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="woodmagic.c8.p63"><s sid="178" id="woodmagic.c8.s178">"Choo Hoo told them that, after many months of wandering, he had at last succeeded in finding the raven; at least he had not seen the raven himself, but the raven had sent a special messenger, the hawfinch, to tell him to be of good cheer, and to return to the wood-pigeons, and to lead them forth against Kapchack, who tottered upon his throne; and that he (the raven) would send the night-jar, or goat-sucker, with crooked and evil counsels to confound Kapchack's wisdom.</s> <s sid="179" id="woodmagic.c8.s179">And indeed, Bevis, my dear, I have myself seen several night-jars about here, and I am rather inclined to think that there is some truth in this part at least of what Choo Hoo says; for it is an old proverb, which I daresay you have heard, that when the gods design the destruction of a monarch they first make him mad, and what can be more mad than Kapchack's proposed marriage with the jay, to which he was doubtless instigated by the night-jars, who, like genii of the air, have been floating in the dusky summer twilight round about his palace?</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="woodmagic.c8.p64"><s sid="180" id="woodmagic.c8.s180">"And they have, I really believe, confounded his council and turned his wisdom to folly; for Kapchack has been so cunning for so many, many years, and all his family have been so cunning, and all his councillors, that now I do believe (only I do not meddle with politics) that this extreme cunning is too clever, and that they will overreach themselves.</s> <s sid="181" id="woodmagic.c8.s181">However, we shall see what is said at the council by-and-by.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="woodmagic.c8.p69"><s sid="200" id="woodmagic.c8.s200">"For in the winter, when the Long Pond is frozen, and the brook nearly covered with ice, and all the ponds and ditches likewise, so vast a horde cannot find enough to satisfy their thirst, and must consequently disperse.</s> <s sid="201" id="woodmagic.c8.s201">Were it not for this Choo Hoo must ere now have overwhelmed us.</s> <s sid="202" id="woodmagic.c8.s202">As it is, Kapchack shivers in his claws, and we all dread the approaching autumn, for Choo Hoo has now approached so near as to be at our very doors.</s> <s sid="203" id="woodmagic.c8.s203">If he only knew one thing he would have no difficulty in remaining here and utterly destroying us."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c9.p2"><s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c9.s7">Cloctaw, the jackdaw, who had flown to the council with him, upon arrival, left his side, and perched rather in the rear.</s> <s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c9.s8">Reynard, the fox, and Sec, the stoat, his friend, waited the approach of the king by some fern near the foot of the pollard.</s> <s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c9.s9">The owl every now and then appeared at the window of his castle, sometimes to see who had arrived, and sometimes to look for the king, who was not yet in sight.</s> <s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c9.s10">Having glanced round, the owl retreated to his study, doubtless to prepare his speech for this important occasion.</s> <s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c9.s11">The heaving up of the leaves and earth, as if an underground plough was at work, showed that the mole had not forgotten his duty; he had come to show his loyalty, and he brought a message from the badger, who had long since been left outside the concert of the animals and birds, humbly begging King Kapchack to accept his homage.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c9.p3"><s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c9.s12">It is true that neither the hare nor the rabbit were present, but that signified nothing, for they had no influence whatever.</s> <s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c9.s13">But the pheasant, who often stood aloof from the court, in his pride of lineage despising Kapchack though he was king, came on this occasion, for he too, like the squirrel, was alarmed at the progress of Choo Hoo, and dreaded a scarcity of the berries of the earth.</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c9.s14">Tchink, the chaffinch, one of the first to come, could not perch still, but restlessly passed round the circle, now talking to one and now to another, and sometimes peering in at the owl's window.</s> <s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c9.s15">But merry as he was, he turned his back upon Te-te, the tomtit, and chief of the spies, disdaining the acquaintance of a common informer.</s> <s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c9.s16">Te-te, not one whit abashed, sat on a willow, and lifted his voice from time to time.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c9.p31"><s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c9.s65">The owl became pale, remembering the secret meeting of the birds, and what was said there, all of which the treacherous weasel must have overheard.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c9.s66">He passed it off by exclaiming:</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c9.s67">"This is really intolerable".</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="woodmagic.c9.p39"><s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c9.s81">When he came near, the weasel fell down and bowed himself before the king, who said nothing, but eyed him scornfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="woodmagic.c9.p45"><s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c9.s94">The number of the rooks, too, was not accurate, and did not give a true idea of their power, for it was the original estimate furnished many years ago, when Kapchack first organised his army, and although the rooks had greatly increased since then, the same return was always made.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c9.s95">But it was well understood that the nation of the rooks could send, and doubtless would send, quite ten thousand beaks into the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="woodmagic.c9.p94"><s sid="241" id="woodmagic.c9.s241">"But in fact I, for once, with the service of your majesty in view, descended (repugnant as it was to my feelings) to play the eavesdropper, and I overheard all that was said, and I can convince your majesty that there are far greater traitors in your dominions than you ever supposed me to be.</s> <s sid="242" id="woodmagic.c9.s242">The gnat does not know half that took place at the council, for he only had it second-hand from that villain, the fox, who is, I believe, secretly bent on your destruction.</s> <s sid="243" id="woodmagic.c9.s243">But I can tell you not only all that went on--I can also relate to you the designs of Kauc, the crow, who conferred with Cloctaw in private, after the meeting was over.</s> <s sid="244" id="woodmagic.c9.s244">And I can also give you good reasons for suspecting Ki Ki, the hawk, whom you have just nominated to the command of your forces, of the intention of making a bargain with Choo Hoo, and of handing you over to him a prisoner."</s> </p>

<p pid="95" id="woodmagic.c9.p95"><s sid="245" id="woodmagic.c9.s245">Now this last was a pure invention of the weasel's out of envy, since Ki Ki had obtained such distinction.</s> <s sid="246" id="woodmagic.c9.s246">Kapchack, much alarmed at these words, ordered him to relate everything in order, and the weasel told him all that had been said at the council, all that Kauc, the crow, had said to Cloctaw, and a hundred other matters which he made up himself.</s> <s sid="247" id="woodmagic.c9.s247">When Kapchack heard these things he was quite confounded, and exclaimed that he was surrounded with traitors, and that he did not see which way to turn.</s> <s sid="248" id="woodmagic.c9.s248">He hopped a little way off, in order the better to consider by himself, and leant his head upon one side.</s> </p>

<p pid="96" id="woodmagic.c9.p96"><s sid="249" id="woodmagic.c9.s249">First he thought to himself:</s> <s sid="250" id="woodmagic.c9.s250">"I must take the command from Ki Ki, but I cannot do that suddenly, lest he should go over to Choo Hoo.</s> <s sid="251" id="woodmagic.c9.s251">I will therefore do it gradually.</s> <s sid="252" id="woodmagic.c9.s252">I will countermand the order for an immediate attack; that will give me time to arrange.</s> <s sid="253" id="woodmagic.c9.s253">Who is to take Ki Ki's place?</s> <s sid="254" id="woodmagic.c9.s254">Clearly the weasel, for though he is an archtraitor, yet he is in the same boat with me; for I know it to be perfectly true that all of them are bitter against him."</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="woodmagic.c9.p97"><s sid="255" id="woodmagic.c9.s255">So he went back to the weasel, and told him that he should give him the chief command of the forces, on the third day following, and meantime told him to come early in the evening to the drain which passed under the orchard, where his palace was, so that he could concert the details of this great state business in secret with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="woodmagic.c9.p98"><s sid="256" id="woodmagic.c9.s256">The weasel, beyond measure delighted at the turn things had taken, and rejoicing extremely at the impending fall of Ki Ki, whom he hated, thanked Kapchack with all his might, till Kapchack, enjoining on him the necessity of secrecy, said "Good-afternoon"; and flew away towards the firs, where his guard was waiting for him.</s> <s sid="257" id="woodmagic.c9.s257">Then the weasel, puffed up and treading the ground proudly, went back to his cave in the elm, and Bevis, seeing that there was nothing more going on that day, stole back to the raspberry canes.</s> </p>

<p pid="99" id="woodmagic.c9.p99"><s sid="258" id="woodmagic.c9.s258">None of them had noticed, not even the cunning weasel, that the mole, when the council broke up, had not left with the rest: indeed, being under the surface of the earth, they easily overlooked him.</s> <s sid="259" id="woodmagic.c9.s259">Now the mole, who hated the weasel beyond all, had waited to have the pleasure of hearing King Kapchack upbraid the traitor, and presently consign him to execution.</s> <s sid="260" id="woodmagic.c9.s260">Fancy then his feelings when, after all, the weasel was received into the highest favour, and promised the supreme command of the army, while he himself was not even noticed, though he was a clever engineer, and could mine and countermine, and carry on siege operations better than any of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="100" id="woodmagic.c9.p100"><s sid="261" id="woodmagic.c9.s261">He listened to all that was said attentively, and then, so soon as Kapchack had flown away, and the weasel had gone to his hole, and Bevis to the raspberries, he drove a tunnel to the edge of the copse, and there calling a fly, sent him with a message to the hawk, asking Ki Ki to meet him beside the leaning stone in the field (which Bevis had once passed), because he had a secret to communicate which would brook no delay.</s> <s sid="262" id="woodmagic.c9.s262">At the same time, as Kapchack was flying to the firs where his guards were waiting, it occurred to him that, although he had no alternative, it was dangerous in the extreme to trust the army to the weasel, who, perhaps, just as there was an opportunity of victory, would retire, and leave him to be destroyed.</s> <s sid="263" id="woodmagic.c9.s263">Thinking about this, he perched on a low hawthorn bush, and asked himself whether it was worth while to attempt to defend a kingdom held under such precarious tenure.</s> <s sid="264" id="woodmagic.c9.s264">Would it not be better to make terms with Choo Hoo, who was not unreasonable, and to divide the territory, and thus reign in peace and safety over half at least,--making it, of course, a condition of the compact that Choo Hoo should help him to put down all domestic traitors?</s> </p>

<p pid="101" id="woodmagic.c9.p101"><s sid="265" id="woodmagic.c9.s265">The idea seemed so good that, first glancing round to see that he was not observed, he called a thrush, who had been coming to the hawthorn, but dared not enter it while the king was there.</s> <s sid="266" id="woodmagic.c9.s266">The thrush, much frightened, came as he was bid, and Kapchack carefully instructed him in what he was to do.</s> <s sid="267" id="woodmagic.c9.s267">Having learnt his message by heart, the thrush, delighted beyond expression at so high a negotiation being entrusted to him, flew straight away towards Choo Hoo's camp.</s> <s sid="268" id="woodmagic.c9.s268">But not unobserved; for just then Ki Ki, wheeling in the air at an immense height, whither he had gone to survey the scene of war, chanced to look down and saw him quit the king, and marked the course he took.</s> <s sid="269" id="woodmagic.c9.s269">Kapchack, unaware that Ki Ki had detected this manoeuvre, now returned to his guards, and flew to his palace.</s> </p>

<p pid="102" id="woodmagic.c9.p102"><s sid="270" id="woodmagic.c9.s270">Meantime the weasel, curled up on his divan in the elm, was thinking over the extraordinary good fortune that had befallen him.</s> <s sid="271" id="woodmagic.c9.s271">Yet such was his sagacity that even when thus about to attain almost the topmost pinnacle of his ambition, he did not forget the instability of affairs, but sought to confirm his position, or even to advance it.</s> <s sid="272" id="woodmagic.c9.s272">He reflected that Kapchack was not only cunning beyond everything ever known, but he was just now a prey to anxieties, and consumed with jealousy, which upset the tenor of his mind, so that his course could not be depended upon, but might be changed in a moment.</s> <s sid="273" id="woodmagic.c9.s273">The favour of a despotic monarch was never a firm staff to lean upon; when that monarch was on the brink of a crisis which threatened both his throne and his life, his smile might become a frown before any one was aware that a change was impending.</s> </p>

<p pid="103" id="woodmagic.c9.p103"><s sid="274" id="woodmagic.c9.s274">Impressed with these ideas, the weasel asked himself how he could at once secure his position and advance himself to further dignity.</s> <s sid="275" id="woodmagic.c9.s275">He considered that up to the present the forces of Kapchack had always been compelled to retreat before the overwhelming masses thrown against them by Choo Hoo.</s> <s sid="276" id="woodmagic.c9.s276">He could scarcely hope under the most favourable circumstances to do more than defend the frontier, and should Choo Hoo win the battle, Kapchack would either be taken prisoner, or, what was not at all unlikely, fall a victim during the confusion, and be assassinated, perhaps, by the villainous crow.</s> <s sid="277" id="woodmagic.c9.s277">Where, then, would be his own high command?</s> <s sid="278" id="woodmagic.c9.s278">But by making terms with Choo Hoo he might himself obtain the throne, and reign perfectly secure as Choo Hoo's regent.</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="woodmagic.c9.p104"><s sid="279" id="woodmagic.c9.s279">On coming to this conclusion, he called to his old friend the humble-bee, and said he desired to send a message to Choo Hoo, the purport of which must not be divulged to any flower upon the route.</s> <s sid="280" id="woodmagic.c9.s280">The humble-bee instantly guessed that this message must be something to the injury of Kapchack, and resenting the manner in which he had been hustled from the council, declared that he would carry it without a moment's delay.</s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="woodmagic.c9.p105"><s sid="281" id="woodmagic.c9.s281">"Go then, my friend," said the weasel.</s> <s sid="282" id="woodmagic.c9.s282">"Go straight to Choo Hoo, and say:</s> <s sid="283" id="woodmagic.c9.s283">'The weasel is appointed to the command of King Kapchack's army, and will supersede Ki Ki, the hawk, upon the third day.</s> <s sid="284" id="woodmagic.c9.s284">On that day he will lead forth the army to the south, professing to go upon a flank march, and to take you in the rear.</s> <s sid="285" id="woodmagic.c9.s285">Be not deceived by this movement, but so soon as you see that the guards are withdrawn from the frontier, cross the border in force, and proceed straight towards the palace.</s> <s sid="286" id="woodmagic.c9.s286">When Kapchack's army finds you between it and its base of supplies it will disperse, and you will obtain an easy victory.</s> </p>

<p pid="106" id="woodmagic.c9.p106"><s sid="287" id="woodmagic.c9.s287">"'And in proof of his good-will towards you, the weasel, furthermore, bade me inform you of the great secret which has hitherto been preserved with such care, and which will enable your army to remain in this place all the winter.</s> <s sid="288" id="woodmagic.c9.s288">In the squirrel's copse there is a spring, which is never frozen, but always affords excellent drinking water, and moistens a considerable extent of ground.'"</s> <s sid="289" id="woodmagic.c9.s289">This was the weasel's message, and without a moment's delay the humble-bee buzzed away direct to Choo Hoo's camp.</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="woodmagic.c9.p108"><s sid="292" id="woodmagic.c9.s292">Now, the mole hated Ki Ki exceedingly, because, as previously related, he had killed his wife, but he hated the weasel, who had persecuted him all his life, even more, and by thus betraying the weasel to the hawk he hoped to set the two traitors by the ears, and to gratify his own vengeance by seeing them tear each other to pieces.</s> <s sid="293" id="woodmagic.c9.s293">Accordingly he now informed Ki Ki of everything--how the weasel had disclosed the names of all those who attended the secret meeting (except one, _i.e._, the owl, which, for reasons of his own, the weasel had suppressed), particularly stating that Ki Ki had taken a foremost part, that Kapchack was enraged against the hawk, and had already promised the weasel the chief command, so that in three days Ki Ki would be superseded.</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="woodmagic.c9.p109"><s sid="294" id="woodmagic.c9.s294">Ki Ki, suppressing his agitation, thanked the mole very cordially for his trouble, and soared towards the sky, but he had scarce gone a hundred yards before one of Kapchack's body-guard met him with a message from the king countermanding the advance of the army which had been decided upon.</s> <s sid="295" id="woodmagic.c9.s295">Ki Ki replied that his majesty's orders should be implicitly obeyed and continued his upward flight.</s> <s sid="296" id="woodmagic.c9.s296">He had now no doubt that what the mole had told him was correct in every particular, since it had been so immediately confirmed; and as for the thrush, it seemed clear that Kapchack had some design of saving himself by the sacrifice of his friends.</s> <s sid="297" id="woodmagic.c9.s297">That must be his reasons for countermanding the advance--to give time for negotiation.</s> <s sid="298" id="woodmagic.c9.s298">Angry beyond measure, Ki Ki flew to his own clump of trees, and calling to him a keen young hawk--one of his guard, and who was only too delighted to be selected for confidential employment--sent him with a flag of truce to Choo Hoo.</s> </p>

<p pid="110" id="woodmagic.c9.p110"><s sid="299" id="woodmagic.c9.s299">He was to say that Ki Ki, being disgusted with the treachery of King Kapchack, had determined to abandon his cause, and that on the day of battle, in the midst of the confusion, if Choo Hoo would push forward rapidly, Ki Ki would draw off his contingent and expose the centre, when Kapchack must inevitably be destroyed.</s> <s sid="300" id="woodmagic.c9.s300">Away flew the hawk, and thus in one hour Choo Hoo received three messengers.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c10.p26"><s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c10.s68">"I will," said the weasel, "and first of all, you know the fine large cake that your mamma is making for you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="woodmagic.c10.p30"><s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c10.s75">"Because," said the weasel, "the mouse has found out where your mamma has put it in the cupboard, and there is a little chink through which he can smell it, but he cannot quite get through, nor is he strong enough to gnaw such very hard wood, else you may depend he would have kept the secret to himself.</s> <s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c10.s76">But as he could not creep through he has gone and told Raoul, the rat, who has such strong teeth he can bite a way through anything, and to-night, when you are all in bed and firm asleep, and everything is quiet, Yish, the mouse, is going to show the rat where the chink is, the rat is going to gnaw a hole, and in the morning there will be very little left of your cake."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c10.p31"><s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c10.s77">"I will tell the bailiff," said Bevis, in a rage, "and the bailiff shall set a trap for the rat."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="woodmagic.c10.p32"><s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c10.s78">"Well, that was what I was going to suggest," said the weasel; "but upon consideration I am not so sure that it is much use telling the bailiff, because, as I daresay you recollect, the bailiff has often tried his hand setting up a trap for the rat, but has never yet caught him, from which I conclude that the rat knows all the places where the bailiff sets the trap, and takes good care not to go that way without previous examination."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="woodmagic.c10.p33"><s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c10.s79">"I'll set up the trap," said Bevis, "I'll set it up myself in a new place.</s> <s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c10.s80">Let me see, where can I put it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="woodmagic.c10.p34"><s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c10.s81">"I think it would be a very good plan if you did put it up yourself," said the weasel, "because there is no doubt you understand more about these things than the bailiff, who is getting old."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="woodmagic.c10.p35"><s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c10.s82">"Yes," said Bevis, "I know all about it--I can do it very well indeed."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="woodmagic.c10.p36" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c10.s83">"Just what I thought," said the weasel; "I thought to myself, Bevis knows all about it--Bevis can do it.</s> <s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c10.s84">Now, as the bailiff has set up the trap by the drain or grating beside the cart-house, and under the wood-pile, and by the pump, and has never caught the rat, it is clear that the rat knows these places as well as the bailiff, and if you remember there is a good deal of grass grows there, so that the rat no doubt says to himself:</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c10.s85"><qs/>'Aha!</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c10.s86">They are sure to put the trap here, because they think I shall not see it in the grass--as if I was so silly.'<qe/></s> <s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c10.s87">So that, depend upon it, he is always very careful how he goes through the grass there.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="woodmagic.c10.p37"><s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c10.s88">"Therefore I think the best place you could select to set up the trap would be somewhere where there is no kind of cover, no grass, nor anything, where it is quite bare and open, and where the rat would run along quickly and never think of any danger.</s> <s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c10.s89">And he would be sure to run much faster and not stay to look under his feet in crossing such places, lest Pan should see him and give chase, or your papa should come round the corner with a gun.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c10.s90">Now I know there is one such place the rat passes every evening; it is a favourite path of his, because it is a short cut to the stable--it is under the wall of the pig-sty.</s> <s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c10.s91">I know this, because I once lived with the rat a little while, and saw all his habits.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="woodmagic.c10.p38"><s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c10.s92">"Well, under this wall it is quite open, and he always runs by extremely fast, and that is the best place to put the trap.</s> <s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c10.s93">Now when you have set the trap, in order to hide it from view do you get your little spade with which you dig in your garden, and take a spadeful of the dust that lies about there (as it is so dry there is plenty of dust) and throw it over the trap.</s> <s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c10.s94">The dust will hide the trap, and will also prevent the rat (for he has a wonderful sharp nose of his own) from scenting where your fingers touched it.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c10.s95">In the morning you are sure to find him caught.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="woodmagic.c10.p39"><s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c10.s96">"By-the-by, you had better not say anything to your mamma that you know of the cake, else perhaps she will move it from the cupboard, and then the rat may go on some other moonlit ramble instead.</s> <s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c10.s97">As I said, in the morning you are sure to find him in the trap, and then do not listen to anything he has to say, for he has a lying tongue, but let Pan loose, who will instantly worry him to death."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="woodmagic.c10.p40"><s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c10.s98">"I will do as you say," said Bevis, "for I see that it is a very clever way to catch the rat, but, Sir Weasel, you have told me so many false stories that I can scarce believe you now it is plain you are telling me the truth; nor shall I feel certain that you are this time (for once in your wicked life) saying the truth, unless I know why you are so anxious for the rat to be caught."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="woodmagic.c10.p41"><s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c10.s99">"Why," said the weasel, "I will tell you the reason; this afternoon the rat played me a very mean and scurvy trick; he disgraced me before the king, and made me a common laughing-stock to all the council, for which I swore to have his life.</s> <s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c10.s100">Besides, upon one occasion he bit his teeth right through my ear--the marks of it are there still.</s> <s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c10.s101">See for yourself."</s> <s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c10.s102">So the weasel thrust his head out of his hole, and Bevis saw the marks left by the rat's teeth, and was convinced that the weasel, out of malice, had at last been able for once to tell the truth.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="woodmagic.c10.p42"><s sid="103" id="woodmagic.c10.s103">"You are a horrid wretch," said Bevis, "still you know how to catch the rat, and I will go home and do it; but I cannot find my way out of this thicket--the squirrel ought to come."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="woodmagic.c10.p43"><s sid="104" id="woodmagic.c10.s104">"The way is under the ash bough there," said the weasel, "and when you are outside the thicket turn to your left and go downhill, and you will come to the timber--and meantime I will send for the dragon-fly, who will overtake you."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="woodmagic.c10.p44"><s sid="105" id="woodmagic.c10.s105">"All right, horrid wretch," said Bevis, and away he went.</s> <s sid="106" id="woodmagic.c10.s106">Now all this that the weasel had said really was true, except about the cake; it was true that the rat was very careful going through the grass, and that he knew where the bailiff set the gin, and that he used to run very quickly across the exposed place under the wall of the pig-sty.</s> <s sid="107" id="woodmagic.c10.s107">But the story about the cake he had made up out of his cunning head just to set Bevis at work to put up the trap; and he hoped too, that while Bevis was setting up the gin, the spring would slip and pinch his fingers.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="woodmagic.c10.p45"><s sid="108" id="woodmagic.c10.s108">By thus catching the rat, the weasel meant in the first place to gratify his own personal malice, and next to get rid of a very formidable competitor.</s> <s sid="109" id="woodmagic.c10.s109">For the rat was very large and very strong, and brave and bold beyond all the others; so much so that the weasel would even have preferred to have a struggle with the fox (though he was so much bigger), whose nostril he could bite, than to meet the rat in fair and equal combat.</s> <s sid="110" id="woodmagic.c10.s110">Besides, he hated the rat beyond measure, because the rat had helped him out of the drain, which was when his ear was bitten through.</s> <s sid="111" id="woodmagic.c10.s111">He intended to go down to the farmyard very early next morning when the rat was caught, and to go as near as he dared and taunt the rat, and tell him how Pan would presently come and crunch up his ribs.</s> <s sid="112" id="woodmagic.c10.s112">To see the rat twist, and hear him groan, would be rare sport; it made his eyes glisten to think of it.</s> <s sid="113" id="woodmagic.c10.s113">He was very desirous that Bevis should find his way home all right, so he at once sent a wasp for the dragon-fly, and the dragon-fly at once started after Bevis.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="woodmagic.c10.p46"><s sid="114" id="woodmagic.c10.s114">Just after the weasel had sent the wasp, the humble-bee returned from Choo Hoo, and delivered the emperor's message, which the weasel saw at once was intended to encourage him in his proposed treachery.</s> <s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c10.s115">He thanked the humble-bee for the care and speed with which his errand had been accomplished, and then curled himself up on his divan to go to sleep, so as to be ready to go down early in the morning and torment the rat.</s> <s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c10.s116">As he was very happy since his schemes were prospering, he went to sleep in a minute as comfortable as could be.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="woodmagic.c10.p47"><s sid="117" id="woodmagic.c10.s117">Bevis crept through the thicket, and turned to the left, and went down the hill, and found the timber, and then went along the green track till he came to the stile.</s> <s sid="118" id="woodmagic.c10.s118">He got over the bridge and followed the footpath, when the dragon-fly overtook him and apologised most sincerely for his neglect.</s> <s sid="119" id="woodmagic.c10.s119">"For," said he, "we are so busy making ready for the army, and I have had so much to do going to and fro with messages, that, my dear Sir Bevis, you must forgive me for forgetting you.</s> <s sid="120" id="woodmagic.c10.s120">Next time I will send a moth to stay close by you, so that the moment you want me the moth can go and fetch me."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="woodmagic.c10.p49"><s sid="123" id="woodmagic.c10.s123">Now there was a snail on the wall, and the snail looked out of his shell and said:</s> <s sid="124" id="woodmagic.c10.s124">"Sir Bevis, do not be too quick.</s> <s sid="125" id="woodmagic.c10.s125">Believe me, if you are too quick to-day you are sure to be sorry to-morrow."</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="woodmagic.c10.p51"><s sid="128" id="woodmagic.c10.s128">"That was your fault," he said to the snail; and snatching the poor thing off the wall, he flung him ever so far; fortunately the snail fell on the grass, and was not hurt, but he said to himself that in future, no matter what he saw going on, he would never interfere, but let people hurt themselves as much as they liked.</s> <s sid="129" id="woodmagic.c10.s129">But Bevis, though he was so hasty, was also very persevering, and presently he succeeded in setting up the trap, and then taking his spade he spread the dust over it and so hid it as the weasel had told him to.</s> <s sid="130" id="woodmagic.c10.s130">He then went and put his spade back in the summer-house, and having told Pan that in the morning there would be a fine big rat for him to worry, went indoors.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c11.p7"><s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c11.s31">After a while the fox came to the conclusion that this must be the toad who, very many years ago, for some offence committed against the state, was imprisoned by Kapchack's orders in the butt of an elm, there to remain till the end of the world.</s> <s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c11.s32">Curious to know why the toad had been punished in this terrible manner, the fox resolved to speak to the prisoner, from whom perhaps he might learn something to Kapchack's disadvantage.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c11.s33">Waiting, therefore, till the crack opened as the gust came, the fox spoke into it, and the toad, only too delighted to get some one to talk to at last, replied directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="woodmagic.c11.p22"><s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c11.s63">The same night, the weasel, having had a very pleasant nap upon his divan in the elm in the squirrel's copse, woke up soon after midnight, and started for the farm, in order to enjoy the pleasure of seeing the rat in the gin, which he had instructed Bevis how to set up.</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c11.s64">Had it not been for this he would not have faced so terrible a tempest, but to see the rat in torture he would have gone through anything.</s> <s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c11.s65">As he crept along a furrow, not far outside the copse, choosing that route that he might be somewhat sheltered in the hollow from the wind, he saw a wire which a poacher had set up, and stayed to consider how he could turn it to his advantage.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="woodmagic.c11.p23"><s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c11.s66">"There is Ulu, the hare," he said to himself, "who lives in the wheat-field; I had her son, he was very sweet and tender, and also her nephew, who was not so juicy, and I have noticed that she has got very plump of late.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c11.s67">She is up on the hill to-night I have no doubt, notwithstanding the tempest, dancing and flirting with her disreputable companions, for vice has such an attraction for some minds that they cannot forego its pleasures, even at the utmost personal inconvenience.</s> <s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c11.s68">Such revels, at such a time of tempest, while the wrath of heaven is wreaked upon the trees, are nothing short of sacrilege, and I for one have always set my mind against irreverence.</s> <s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c11.s69">I shall do the world a service if I rid it of such an abandoned creature."</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c11.s70">So he called to a moor-hen, who was flying over from the Long Pond at a tremendous pace, being carried before the wind, and the moor-hen, not without a great deal of trouble, managed to wheel round (she was never very clever with her wings) to receive his commands, for she did not dare to pass over or slight so high a personage.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="woodmagic.c11.p24"><s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c11.s71">"Moor-hen," said the weasel, "do you go direct to the hills and find Ulu, the hare, and tell her that little Sir Bevis, of whom she is so fond, is lost in the copse, and that he is crying bitterly because of the darkness and the wind, and what will become of him I do not know.</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c11.s72">I have done my very best to show him the way home, but he cherishes an unfortunate prejudice against me, and will not listen to what I say.</s> <s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c11.s73">Therefore if the hare does not come immediately and show him the way I greatly fear that he will be knocked down by the branches, or cry his dear pretty darling heart out; and tell her that he is at this minute close to the birches.</s> <s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c11.s74">Go quickly, Moor-hen."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="woodmagic.c11.p25"><s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c11.s75">"I will, my lord," said the moor-hen, and away she flew.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c11.p26"><s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c11.s76">Then the weasel proceeded on his way, and shortly afterwards arrived at the farm.</s> <s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c11.s77">As he came quietly down from the rick-yard, he said to himself:</s> <s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c11.s78">"I will keep a good way from the wall, as it is so dark, and I do not know the exact place where Bevis has put the trap.</s> <s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c11.s79">Besides, it is just possible that the rat may not yet have passed that way, for he does most of his business in the early morning, and it is not yet dawn."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="woodmagic.c11.p27"><s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c11.s80">So he crossed over to the wood-pile and listened carefully, but could hear no groans, as he had expected; but, on consideration, he put this down to the wind, which he observed blew the sound away from him.</s> <s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c11.s81">He then slipped over to the grass by the cart-house wall, intending to listen at the mouth of the drain to hear if the rat was within, and then if that was not the case, to go on along towards the wall of the pig-sty, for he began to think the rat must have been stunned by the trap, and so could not squeak.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="woodmagic.c11.p28"><s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c11.s82">If that was the case, he thought he would just bite off the end of the rat's tail, in revenge for the terrible meal he had once been obliged to make upon his own, and also to wake up the rat to the misery of his position.</s> <s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c11.s83">But just as he approached the mouth of the drain, sniffing and listening with the utmost caution, it happened that a drop of rain fell through a chink in the top of Pan's tub, and woke him from his slumber.</s> <s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c11.s84">Pan shook himself and turned round, and the weasel, hearing the disturbance, dreaded lest Pan was loose, and had caught scent of him.</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c11.s85">He darted forwards to get into the drain, when the trap, which the bailiff had so carefully removed from where Bevis had set it, snapped him up in a second.</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c11.s86">The shock and the pain made him faint; he turned over and lay still.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="woodmagic.c11.p29"><s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c11.s87">About the same time the moor-hen, borne swiftly along by the wind on her way to the river, reached the hills, and seeing the hare, flew low down and delivered the weasel's message as well as she could.</s> <s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c11.s88">The hare was dreadfully alarmed about Sir Bevis, and anxious to relieve him from his fright in the dark copse, raced down the hill, and over the fields as fast as she could go, making towards that part of the copse where the birches stood, as the weasel had directed, knowing that in running there she would find her neck in a noose.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="woodmagic.c11.p30"><s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c11.s89">It happened just as he had foreseen.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c11.s90">She came along as fast as the wind, and could already see the copse like a thicker darkness before her, when the loop of the wire drew up around her neck, and over she rolled in the furrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c11.p31"><s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c11.s91">Now the weasel had hoped that the wire would not hang her at once.</s> <s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c11.s92">He intended to have come back from the farm, and from taunting the rat in the trap, in time to put his teeth into her veins, before, in her convulsive efforts to get free, she tightened the noose and died.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="woodmagic.c11.p32"><s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c11.s93">And this, too, happened exactly as the weasel had intended, but in a different manner, and with a different result; for it had chanced that the wind, in the course of its ravages among the trees, snapped off a twig of ash, which rolling over and over before the blast along the sward, came against the stick which upheld the wire, and the end of the twig where it had broken from the tree lodged in the loop.</s> <s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c11.s94">Thus, when Ulu kicked, and struggled, and screamed, in her fear, the noose indeed drew up tight and half-strangled her, but not quite, because the little piece of wood prevented it.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c11.s95">But, exhausted with pain and terror, and partially choked, the poor hare at last could do nothing else but crouch down in the furrow, where the rain fell on and soaked her warm coat of fur.</s> <s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c11.s96">For as the dawn came on the wind sank, and the rain fell.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="woodmagic.c11.p33"><s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c11.s97">In this unhappy plight she passed the rest of the night, dreading every moment lest the fox should come along (as she could not run away), and not less afraid of the daybreak, when some one would certainly find her.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="woodmagic.c11.p34"><s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c11.s98">After many weary hours, the bailiff coming to his work in the morning with a sack over his shoulders to keep out the rain, saw something on the grass, and pounced upon the wretched hare.</s> <s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c11.s99">Already his great thumb was against the back of her neck--already she was thrown across his knee--already she felt her sinews stretch, as he proceeded to break her neck, regardless of her shrieks--when suddenly it occurred to him how delighted Bevis would be with a living hare.</s> <s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c11.s100">For the bailiff was very fond of Bevis, and would have done anything to please him.</s> <s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c11.s101">So he took the hare in his arms, and carried her down to the farm.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="woodmagic.c11.p35"><s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c11.s102">When Bevis got up and came to breakfast, the bailiff came in and brought him the hare, expecting that he would be highly pleased.</s> <s sid="103" id="woodmagic.c11.s103">But Bevis in an instant recognised his friend who had shown him his way in the cowslips, and flew into a rage, and beat the bailiff with his fist for his cruelty.</s> <s sid="104" id="woodmagic.c11.s104">Nothing would satisfy him but he must let the hare go free before he touched his breakfast.</s> <s sid="105" id="woodmagic.c11.s105">He would not sit down, he stamped and made such a to-do that at last they let him have his own way.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="woodmagic.c11.p36"><s sid="106" id="woodmagic.c11.s106">He would not even allow the bailiff to carry the hare for him; he took her in his arms and went with her up the footpath into the field.</s> <s sid="107" id="woodmagic.c11.s107">He would not even permit them to follow him.</s> <s sid="108" id="woodmagic.c11.s108">Now, the hare knew him very well but could not speak when any one else was near, for it is very well known to be a law among hares and birds, and such creatures, that they can only talk to one human being, and are dumb when more than one are present.</s> <s sid="109" id="woodmagic.c11.s109">But when Bevis had taken her out into the footpath, and set her down, and stroked her back, and her long ears, black at the tip, and had told her to go straight up the footpath, and not through the long grass, because it was wet with the rain, the hare told him how she came in the wire through the wicked weasel telling her that he was lost in the copse.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="woodmagic.c11.p37"><s sid="110" id="woodmagic.c11.s110">"I was not lost," said Bevis; "I went to bed, and saw the owl go by.</s> <s sid="111" id="woodmagic.c11.s111">The weasel told another of his stories--now, I remember, he told me to set the trap for the rat."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="woodmagic.c11.p38"><s sid="112" id="woodmagic.c11.s112">"Did he?" said the hare; "then you may depend it is some more of his dreadful wickedness; there will be no peace in the world while he is allowed to go roaming about."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="woodmagic.c11.p39"><s sid="113" id="woodmagic.c11.s113">"No," said Bevis, "that there will not: but as sure as my papa's gun, which is the best gun in the country, as sure as my papa's gun I will kill him the next time I see him.</s> <s sid="114" id="woodmagic.c11.s114">I will not listen to the squirrel, I will cut the weasel's tree down, and chop off his head."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="woodmagic.c11.p40"><s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c11.s115">"I hope you will, dear," said the hare.</s> <s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c11.s116">"But now I must be gone, for I can hear Pan barking, and no doubt he can smell me; besides which, it is broad daylight, and I must go and hide; good-bye, my dear Sir Bevis."</s> <s sid="117" id="woodmagic.c11.s117">And away went the hare up the footpath till Bevis lost sight of her through the gateway.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="woodmagic.c11.p41"><s sid="118" id="woodmagic.c11.s118">Then he went to his breakfast, and directly afterwards, putting on his greatcoat, for it still rained a little, he went up to the wall by the pig-sty expecting to find the rat in the trap.</s> <s sid="119" id="woodmagic.c11.s119">But the trap was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="woodmagic.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="woodmagic.c12.s1">The very same morning, after the rain had ceased, the keeper who looked after the great woods at the other end of the Long Pond set out with his gun and his dogs to walk round the preserves.</s> <s sid="2" id="woodmagic.c12.s2">Now the dogs he took with him were the very best dogs he had, for that night a young gentleman, who had just succeeded to the estate, was coming down from London, and on the following morning would be sure to go out shooting.</s> <s sid="3" id="woodmagic.c12.s3">This young gentleman had unexpectedly come into the property through the death of the owner, who was shot in his bedroom by a burglar.</s> <s sid="4" id="woodmagic.c12.s4">The robber had once been his groom, and the squirrel told Bevis how it all happened through a flint falling out of the hole in the bottom of the waggon which belonged to the old farmer in whose orchard Kapchack had his palace.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c12.p2"><s sid="5" id="woodmagic.c12.s5">The heir had been kept at a distance during the old gentleman's lifetime, for the old gentleman always meant to marry and have a son, but did not do so, and also always meant to make a will and leave the best part of his estate to somebody else, but he did not do so, and as the old toad in the rhubarb patch told Bevis afterwards when he heard the story, if you are only going to do a thing, it would be no use if you lived a thousand years, it would always be just the same.</s> <s sid="6" id="woodmagic.c12.s6">So the young fellow, who had been poor all his life, when he thus suddenly jumped into such a property, was not a little elated, and wrote to the keeper that he should come down and have some shooting.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c12.p3"><s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c12.s7">The keeper was rather alarmed at this, for the former owner was not a sporting man, and did not look strictly after such things, so that the game had been neglected and had got scarce; and what was worse, the dogs were out of training.</s> <s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c12.s8">He therefore got up early that morning, intending to go his rounds quickly, and then take the dogs out into the stubble, and try and thrash them into some use.</s> <s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c12.s9">Presently, as he walked along, he came to the glade in the woods, and saw the dead hawk hanging from the trap up in the old oak-tree.</s> <s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c12.s10">Pleased to find that his trap, so cunningly placed, had not been prepared in vain, he went up to the oak, leaned his gun against the trunk, ordered the dogs to lie down (which they did with some reluctance), and then climbed up into the tree to re-set the gin.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="woodmagic.c12.p4"><s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c12.s11">He took the hawk from the trap (his feathers were all draggled and wet from the rain), and threw the dead bird down; and, whether it was that the act of throwing it caused an extra strain upon the bough, or whether the storm had cracked it in the night, or whether it had rotted away more than appeared on the surface, or whether it was all of these things together, certain it is the bough broke, and down came the keeper thud on the sward.</s> <s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c12.s12">The bough fell down with him, and as it fell it struck the gun, and the gun exploded, and although the dogs scampered aside when they heard the crack, they did not scamper so quick but one of them was shot dead, and the other two were mortally wounded.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="woodmagic.c12.p5"><s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c12.s13">For a while the keeper lay there stunned, with the wet grass against his face.</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c12.s14">But by-and-by, coming to himself, he sat up with difficulty, and called for assistance, for he could not move, having sprained one ankle, and broken the small bone of the other leg.</s> <s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c12.s15">There he sat and shouted, but no one came for some time, till presently a slouching labourer (it was the very same who put up the wire by the copse in which the hare was caught) chanced to pass by outside the wood.</s> <s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c12.s16">The keeper saw him, but hoarse with shouting, and feeling faint too (for a sprained ankle is extremely painful), he could not make him hear.</s> <s sid="17" id="woodmagic.c12.s17">But he bethought him of his gun, and dragging it to him, hastily put in a cartridge and fired.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="woodmagic.c12.p6"><s sid="18" id="woodmagic.c12.s18">The report drew the labourer's attention, and peering into the wood, he saw some one on the ground waving a white handkerchief.</s> <s sid="19" id="woodmagic.c12.s19">After looking a long time, he made up his mind to go and see what it was; but then he recollected that if he put his foot inside the wood he should be trespassing, and as he had got a wire in his pocket that would be a serious matter.</s> <s sid="20" id="woodmagic.c12.s20">So he altered his mind, and went on.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c12.p7"><s sid="21" id="woodmagic.c12.s21">Very likely the keeper was angry, but there was no one to hear what he said except the dead hawk.</s> <s sid="22" id="woodmagic.c12.s22">He would have fired off fifty cartridges if he had had them, but as he did not like a weight to carry he had only two or three, and these did not attract attention.</s> <s sid="23" id="woodmagic.c12.s23">As for the labourer, about midday, when he sat down to lunch in the cart-house at the farm where he worked with the other men, he did just mention that he thought he had seen something white waving in the wood, and they said it was odd, but very likely nothing to speak of.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="woodmagic.c12.p8"><s sid="24" id="woodmagic.c12.s24">One of the wounded dogs ran home, bleeding all the way, and there crept into his kennel and died; the other could not get so far, but dropped in a hedge.</s> <s sid="25" id="woodmagic.c12.s25">The keeper's wife wondered why he did not come home to dinner, but supposed, with a sigh, that he had looked in at an alehouse, and went on with her work.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c12.p9"><s sid="26" id="woodmagic.c12.s26">The keeper shouted again when his throat got less hoarse, but all the answer he obtained was the echo from the wood.</s> <s sid="27" id="woodmagic.c12.s27">He tried to crawl, but the pain was so exquisite he got but a very little way, and there he had to lie.</s> <s sid="28" id="woodmagic.c12.s28">The sun rose higher and shone out as the clouds rolled away, and the rain-drops on the grass glistened bright till presently they dried up.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c12.p10"><s sid="29" id="woodmagic.c12.s29">With the gleaming of the sun there was motion in the woods: blackbirds came forth and crossed the glades; thrushes flew past; a jay fluttered round the tops of the firs; after a while a pheasant came along the verge of the underwood, now stepping out into the grass, and now back again into the bushes.</s> <s sid="30" id="woodmagic.c12.s30">There was a pleasant cawing of rooks, and several small parties of wood-pigeons (doubtless from Choo Hoo's camp) went over.</s> <s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c12.s31">Two or three rabbits hopped out and fed; humble-bees went buzzing by; a green woodpecker flashed across the glade and disappeared among the trees as if an arrow had been shot into the woods.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="woodmagic.c12.p11"><s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c12.s32">The slow hours went on, and as the sun grew hotter the keeper, unable to move, began to suffer from the fierceness of the rays, for anything still finds out the heat more than that which is in movement.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c12.s33">First he lifted his hat from time to time above his head, but it was not much relief, as the wind had fallen.</s> <s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c12.s34">Next he tried placing his handkerchief inside his hat.</s> <s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c12.s35">At last he took off his coat, stuck the barrels of his gun into the ground (soft from the rain), and hung the coat upon it.</s> <s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c12.s36">This gave him a little shadow.</s> <s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c12.s37">The dead oak-tree having no leaves cast but a narrow shade, and that fell on the opposite side to where he was.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c12.p12"><s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c12.s38">In the afternoon, when the heat was very great and all the other birds appeared to have gone, a crow came (one of Kauc's retainers) and perched low down on an ash-tree not more than fifty yards away.</s> <s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c12.s39">Perhaps it was the dead dog; perhaps it was the knowledge that the man was helpless, that brought him.</s> <s sid="40" id="woodmagic.c12.s40">There he perched, and the keeper reviled him, wishing that he had but saved one of his cartridges, and forgetting that even then the barrels of his gun were too full of earth.</s> <s sid="41" id="woodmagic.c12.s41">After a while the crow flew idly across to the other side of the glade, and went out of sight; but it was only for a short time, and presently he came back again.</s> <s sid="42" id="woodmagic.c12.s42">This the crow did several times, always returning to the ash.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="woodmagic.c12.p13"><s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c12.s43">The keeper ran over in his mind the people who would probably miss him, and cause a search to be made.</s> <s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c12.s44">First there was his wife; but once, when he had been a long time from home, and she in a great alarm had sought for him, she found him drunk at the alehouse, and he beat her for her trouble.</s> <s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c12.s45">It was not likely that she would come.</s> <s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c12.s46">The lad who acted as his assistant (he had but one, for, as previously stated, the former owner did not shoot) was not likely to look for him either, for not long since, bringing a message to his superior, he discovered him selling some game, and was knocked down for his pains.</s> <s sid="47" id="woodmagic.c12.s47">As for his companions at the alehouse, they would be all out in the fields, and would not assemble till night: several of them he knew were poachers, and though glad enough to share his beer would not have looked towards him if in distress.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="woodmagic.c12.p14"><s sid="48" id="woodmagic.c12.s48">The slow hours wore on, and the sun declining a little, the shadow of the dead oak moved round, and together with his coat sheltered him fairly well.</s> <s sid="49" id="woodmagic.c12.s49">Weary with the unwonted labour of thinking, the tension of his mind began to yield, and by-and-by he dropped asleep, lying at full length upon his back.</s> <s sid="50" id="woodmagic.c12.s50">The crow returned once more to the ash, and looked at the sleeping man and the dead dog, cleaned his beak against the bough, and uttered a low croak.</s> <s sid="51" id="woodmagic.c12.s51">Once he flew a little way out towards them, but there was the gun: it was true he knew very well there was no powder (for, in the first place, he could not smell any, and, secondly, if there had been any he knew he should have had the shot singing about his ears long before this; you see, he could put two and two together), still there was the gun.</s> <s sid="52" id="woodmagic.c12.s52">The dog does not like the corner where the walking-stick stands.</s> <s sid="53" id="woodmagic.c12.s53">The crow did not like the gun, though it was stuck in the ground: he went back to the ash, cleaned his bill, and waited.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="woodmagic.c12.p15"><s sid="54" id="woodmagic.c12.s54">Something came stealthily through the grass, now stopping, now advancing with a creeping, evil motion.</s> <s sid="55" id="woodmagic.c12.s55">It was the weasel.</s> <s sid="56" id="woodmagic.c12.s56">When he stole away from the wood-pile, after escaping from the trap, he made up the field towards the copse, but upon reflection he determined to abandon his lair in the hollow elm, for he had so abused Bevis's good-nature that he doubted whether Bevis might not attack him even there despite the squirrel.</s> <s sid="57" id="woodmagic.c12.s57">He did not know exactly where to go, knowing that every creature was in secret his enemy, and in his wounded state, unable to move quickly or properly defend himself, he dreaded to trust himself near them.</s> <s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c12.s58">After a while he remembered the old dead oak, which was also hollow within, and which was so far from the copse it was not probable Bevis would find it.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="woodmagic.c12.p16"><s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c12.s59">Thither he bent his painful steps, for his broken rib hurt him very much, and after many pauses to rest, presently, in the afternoon, he came near.</s> <s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c12.s60">Lifting his head above the grass he saw the dead dog, and the sleeping keeper; he watched them a long time, and seeing that neither of them moved he advanced closer.</s> <s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c12.s61">As he approached he saw the dead hawk, and recognised one of Ki Ki's retainers; then coming to the dog, the blood from the shot wounds excited his terrible thirst.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c12.s62">But it had ceased to flow; he sniffed at it and then went towards the man.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c12.p17"><s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c12.s63">The crow, envious, but afraid to join the venture, watched him from the ash.</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c12.s64">Every few inches the weasel stayed, lifted his head; looked, and listened.</s> <s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c12.s65">Then he advanced again, paused, and again approached.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c12.s66">In five minutes he had reached the keeper's feet; two minutes more and he was by his waist.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c12.s67">He listened again; he sniffed, he knew it was dangerous, but he could not check the resistless prompting of his appetite.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c12.p18"><s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c12.s68">He crept up on the keeper's chest; the crow fidgeted on the ash.</s> <s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c12.s69">He crept up to the necktie; the crow came down on a lower bough.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c12.s70">He moved yet another inch to the collar; the crow flew out ten yards and settled on the ground.</s> <s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c12.s71">The collar was stiff, and partly covered that part of the neck which fascinated the weasel's gaze.</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c12.s72">He put his foot softly on the collar; the crow hopped thrice towards them.</s> <s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c12.s73">He brought up his other foot, he sniffed--the breath came warm from the man's half-open lips--he adventured the risk, and placed his paw on the keeper's neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c12.p19"><s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c12.s74">Instantly--as if he had received an electric shock--the keeper started to his knees, shuddering; the weasel dropped from his neck upon the ground, the crow hastened back to the ash.</s> <s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c12.s75">With a blow of his open hand the keeper knocked the weasel yards away; then, in his rage and fear, with whitened face, he wished instead he had beaten the creature down upon the earth, for the weasel, despite the grinding of his broken rib, began to crawl off, and he could not reach him.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="woodmagic.c12.p20"><s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c12.s76">He looked round for a stick or stone, there was none; he put his hand in his pocket, but his knife had slipped out when he fell from the tree.</s> <s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c12.s77">He passed his hands over his waistcoat seeking for something, felt his watch--a heavy silver one--and in his fury snatched it from the swivel, and hurled it at the weasel.</s> <s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c12.s78">The watch thrown with such force missed the weasel, struck the sward, and bounded up against the oak: the glass shivered and flew sparkling a second in the sunshine; the watch glanced aside, and dropped in the grass.</s> <s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c12.s79">When he looked again the weasel had gone.</s> <s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c12.s80">It was an hour before the keeper recovered himself--the shuddering terror with which he woke up haunted him in the broad daylight.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="woodmagic.c12.p21"><s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c12.s81">An intolerable thirst now tormented him, but the furrow was dry.</s> <s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c12.s82">In the morning, he remembered it had contained a little water from the rain, which during the day had sunk into the earth.</s> <s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c12.s83">He picked a bennet from the grass and bit it, but it was sapless, dried by the summer heat.</s> <s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c12.s84">He looked for a leaf of sorrel, but there was none.</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c12.s85">The slow hours wore on; the sun sank below the wood, and the long shadows stretched out.</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c12.s86">By-and-by the grass became cooler to the touch; dew was forming upon it.</s> <s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c12.s87">Overhead the rooks streamed homewards to their roosting trees.</s> <s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c12.s88">They cawed incessantly as they flew; they were talking about Kapchack and Choo Hoo, but he did not understand them.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="woodmagic.c12.p22"><s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c12.s89">The shadows reached across the glade, and yonder the rabbits appeared again from among the bushes where their burrows were.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c12.s90">He began now to seriously think that he should have to pass the night there.</s> <s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c12.s91">His ankle was swollen, and the pain almost beyond endurance.</s> <s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c12.s92">The slightest attempt at motion caused intense agony.</s> <s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c12.s93">His one hope now was that the same slouching labourer who had passed in the morning would go back that way at night; but as the shadows deepened that hope departed, and he doubted too whether any one could see him through the underwood in the dark.</s> <s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c12.s94">The slouching labourer purposely avoided that route home.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c12.s95">He did not want to see anything, if anything there was.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="woodmagic.c12.p23"><s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c12.s96">He went round by the high road, and having had his supper, and given his wife a clout in the head, he sauntered down to the alehouse.</s> <s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c12.s97">After he had taken three quarts of beer, he mentioned the curious incident of the white handkerchief in the woods to his mates, who congratulated him on his sense in refraining from going near it, as most likely it was one of that keeper's tricks, just to get somebody into the wood.</s> <s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c12.s98">More talk, and more beer.</s> <s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c12.s99">By-and-by the keeper's wife began to feel alarmed.</s> <s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c12.s100">She had already found the dead dog in the kennel; but that did not surprise her in the least, knowing her husband's temper, and that if a dog disobeyed it was not at all unusual for a cartridge to go whistling after him.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="woodmagic.c12.p24"><s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c12.s101">But when the evening came, and the darkness fell; when she had gone down to the alehouse, braving his wrath, and found that he was not there, the woman began to get hysterical.</s> <s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c12.s102">The lad who acted as assistant had gone home, so she went out into the nearest stubble herself, thinking that her husband must have finished his round before lunch, and was somewhere in the newly-reaped fields.</s> <s sid="103" id="woodmagic.c12.s103">But after walking about the rustling stubble till she was weary, she came back to the alehouse, and begged the men to tell her if they had seen anything of him.</s> <s sid="104" id="woodmagic.c12.s104">Then they told her about the white handkerchief which the slouching poacher had seen in the wood that morning.</s> <s sid="105" id="woodmagic.c12.s105">She turned on him like a tiger, and fiercely upbraided him; then rushed from the house.</s> <s sid="106" id="woodmagic.c12.s106">The sloucher took up his quart, and said that he saw "no call" to hurry.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="woodmagic.c12.p25"><s sid="107" id="woodmagic.c12.s107">But some of the men went after the wife.</s> <s sid="108" id="woodmagic.c12.s108">The keeper was found, and brought home on a cart, but not before he had seen the owl go by, and the dark speck of the bat passing to and fro overhead.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c12.p26"><s sid="109" id="woodmagic.c12.s109">All that day Bevis did not go to the copse, being much upset with the cheat the weasel had played him, and also because they said the grass and the hedges would be so wet after the storm.</s> <s sid="110" id="woodmagic.c12.s110">Nor did anything take place in the copse, for King Kapchack moped in his fortress, the orchard, the whole day long, so greatly was he depressed by the widespread treason of which the owl had informed him.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="woodmagic.c12.p27"><s sid="111" id="woodmagic.c12.s111">Choo Hoo, thinking that the treaty was concluded, relaxed the strictness of discipline, and permitted his army to spread abroad from the camp and forage for themselves.</s> <s sid="112" id="woodmagic.c12.s112">He expected the return of the ambassador with further communications, and ordered search to be made for every dainty for his entertainment; while the thrush, for whom this care was taken, had not only ceased to exist, but it would have been impossible to collect his feathers, blown away to every quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="woodmagic.c12.p28"><s sid="113" id="woodmagic.c12.s113">The vast horde of barbarians were the more pleased with the liberty accorded to them, because they had spent so ill a night while the gale raged through their camp.</s> <s sid="114" id="woodmagic.c12.s114">So soon as the sun began to gleam through the retreating clouds, they went forth in small parties, many of which the keeper saw go over him while lying helpless by the dead oak-tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="woodmagic.c12.p29"><s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c12.s115">King Kapchack, after the owl had informed him of the bewildering maze of treason with which he was surrounded, moped, as has been said before, upon his perch.</s> <s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c12.s116">In the morning, wet and draggled from the storm, his feathers out of place, and without the spirit to arrange them, he seemed to have grown twenty years older in one night, so pitiable did he appear.</s> <s sid="117" id="woodmagic.c12.s117">Nor did the glowing sun, which filled all other hearts with joy, reach his gloomy soul.</s> <s sid="118" id="woodmagic.c12.s118">He saw no resource; no enterprise suggested itself to him; all was dark at noonday.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="woodmagic.c12.p30"><s sid="119" id="woodmagic.c12.s119">An ominous accident which had befallen the aged apple-tree in which his palace stood contributed to this depression of mind.</s> <s sid="120" id="woodmagic.c12.s120">The gale had cracked a very large bough, which, having shown signs of weakness, had for many years been supported by a prop carefully put up by the farmer.</s> <s sid="121" id="woodmagic.c12.s121">But whether the prop in course of time had decayed at the line where the air and earth exercise their corroding influence upon wood; or whether the bough had stiffened with age, and could not swing easily to the wind; or whether, as seems most likely, the event occurred at that juncture in order to indicate the course of fate, it is certain that the huge bough was torn partly away from the trunk, leaving a gaping cavity.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c12.p31"><s sid="122" id="woodmagic.c12.s122">Kapchack viewed the injury to the tree, which had so long sustained his family and fortune, with the utmost concern; it seemed an omen of approaching destruction so plain and unmistakable that he could not look at it; he turned his mournful gaze in the opposite direction.</s> <s sid="123" id="woodmagic.c12.s123">The day passed slowly, as slowly as it did to the keeper lying beneath the oak, and the king, though he would have resented intrusion with the sharpest language, noticed with an increasing sense of wrong that the court was deserted, and with one exception none called to pay their respects.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="woodmagic.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="woodmagic.c13.s1">The next morning Bevis's papa looking at the almanac found there was going to be an eclipse of the sun, so Bevis took a piece of glass (part of one of the many window panes he had broken) and smoked it over a candle, so as to be able to watch the phenomenon without injury to his eyes.</s> <s sid="2" id="woodmagic.c13.s2">When the obscuration began too, the dairy-maid brought him a bucket of clear water in which the sun was reflected and could be distinctly seen.</s> <s sid="3" id="woodmagic.c13.s3">But before the eclipse had proceeded beyond the mere edge of the sun, Bevis heard the champing of a bit, and the impatient pawing of hoofs, and running up to the stable to see who it was, found that his papa was just on the point of driving over in the dog-cart to see another farmer (the very old gentleman in whose orchard Kapchack's palace was situated) about a load of straw.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c13.p2"><s sid="4" id="woodmagic.c13.s4">Bevis of course insisted upon going too, the smoked glass was thrown aside, he clambered up and held the reins, and away they went, the eclipse now counting for nothing.</s> <s sid="5" id="woodmagic.c13.s5">After a while, however, as they went swiftly along the road, they came to a hill, and from the summit saw a long way off a vast shadow like that cast by some immense cloud which came towards them over the earth, and in a second or two arrived, and as it were put out the light.</s> <s sid="6" id="woodmagic.c13.s6">They looked up and the sun was almost gone.</s> <s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c13.s7">In its place was a dark body, with a rim of light round it, and flames shooting forth.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c13.p3"><s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c13.s8">As they came slowly down the hill a pheasant crowed as he flew up to roost, the little birds retired to the thickets, and at the farmyards they passed the fowls went up to their perches.</s> <s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c13.s9">Presently they left the highway and drove along a lane across the fields, which had once been divided from each other by gates.</s> <s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c13.s10">Of these there was nothing now standing but the posts, some of which could hardly be said to stand, but declining from the perpendicular, were only kept from falling by the bushes.</s> <s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c13.s11">The lane was so rough and so bad from want of mending that they could only walk the impatient horse, and at times the jolting was extremely unpleasant.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c13.p9"><s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c13.s34">Once upon a time, many, many years ago, when the old gentleman was young, and lived with his mother at the farmhouse, it happened that he fell in love.</s> <s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c13.s35">The lady he loved was very young, very beautiful, very proud, very capricious, and very poor.</s> <s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c13.s36">She lived in a house in the village little better than a cottage, with an old woman who was said to be her aunt.</s> <s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c13.s37">As the young farmer was well off, for the land was his own, and he had no one to keep but his old mother, and as the young lady dearly loved him, there seemed no possible obstacle in their way.</s> <s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c13.s38">But it is well known that a brook can never run straight, and thus, though all looked so smooth, there were, in reality, two difficulties.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c13.p10"><s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c13.s39">The first of these was the farmer's old mother, who having been mistress in the farmhouse for very nearly fifty years, did not like, after half-a-century, to give place to a mere girl.</s> <s sid="40" id="woodmagic.c13.s40">She could not refrain from uttering disparaging remarks about her, to which her son, being fond of his mother, could not reply, though it angered him to the heart, and at such times he used to take down his long single-barrelled gun with brass fittings, and go out shooting.</s> <s sid="41" id="woodmagic.c13.s41">More than once the jealous mother had insulted the young lady openly in the village street, which conduct, of course, as things fly from roof to roof with the sparrows, was known all over the place, and caused the lady to toss her head like a filly in spring to show that she did not care for such an old harridan, though in secret it hurt her pride beyond expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="woodmagic.c13.p11"><s sid="42" id="woodmagic.c13.s42">So great was the difficulty this caused, that the young lady, notwithstanding she was so fond of the handsome young farmer, who rode so well and shot so straight, and could carry her in his arms as if she were no more than a lamb, would never put her dainty foot, which looked so little and pretty even in the rude shoes made for her by the village cobbler, over the threshold of his house.</s> <s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c13.s43">She would never come in, she said, except as a wife, while he on his part, anxious as he was to marry her, could not, from affection for his mother, summon up courage to bring her in, as it were, rough-shod over his mother's feelings.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c13.p12"><s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c13.s44">Their meetings, therefore, as she would not come indoors, were always held in the farmer's orchard, where was a seat in an arbour, a few yards in front of which stood the ancient apple-tree in which Kapchack, who was also very young in those days, had built his nest.</s> <s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c13.s45">At this arbour they met every day, and often twice a day, and even once again in the evening, and could there chat and make love as sweetly as they pleased, because the orchard was enclosed by a high wall which quite shut out all spying eyes, and had a gate with lock and key.</s> <s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c13.s46">The young lady had a duplicate key, and came straight to the orchard from the cottage where she lived by a footpath which crossed the lane along which Bevis had been driven.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="woodmagic.c13.p13"><s sid="47" id="woodmagic.c13.s47">It happened that the footpath just by the lane, on coming near the orchard, passed a moist place, which in rainy weather was liable to be flooded, and as this was inconvenient for her, her lover had a waggon-load of flints brought down from the hills where the hares held their revels, and placed in the hollow so as to fill it up, and over these he placed faggots of nut-tree wood, so that she could step across perfectly clean and dry.</s> <s sid="48" id="woodmagic.c13.s48">In this orchard, then, they had their constant rendezvous; they were there every day when the nightingale first began to sing in the spring, and when the apple-trees were hidden with their pink blossom, when the haymakers were at work in the meadow, when the reapers cut the corn, and when the call of the first fieldfare sounded overhead.</s> <s sid="49" id="woodmagic.c13.s49">The golden and rosy apples dropped at their feet, they laughed and ate them, and taking out the brown pips she pressed them between her thumb and finger to see how far they would shoot.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="woodmagic.c13.p14"><s sid="50" id="woodmagic.c13.s50">Though they had begun to talk about their affairs in the spring, and had kept on all the summer and autumn, and though they kept on as often as the weather was dry (when they walked up and down the long orchard for warmth, sheltered by the wall), yet when the spring came again they had not half finished.</s> <s sid="51" id="woodmagic.c13.s51">Thus they were very happy, and the lady used particularly to laugh at the antics of the magpie, who became so accustomed to their presence as to go on with the repairs to his nest without the least shyness.</s> <s sid="52" id="woodmagic.c13.s52">Kapchack, being then very young and full of spirits, and only just married, and in the honeymoon of prosperity, played such freaks and behaved in so amusing a manner that the lady became quite attached to him, and in order to protect her favourite, her lover drove away all the other large birds that came near the orchard, and would not permit any one whatever to get up into Kapchack's apple-tree, nor even to gather the fruit, which hung on the boughs till the wind pushed it off.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="woodmagic.c13.p15"><s sid="53" id="woodmagic.c13.s53">Thus, having a fortress to retreat to, and being so highly honoured of men, Kapchack gave the reins to his natural audacity, and succeeded in obtaining the sovereignty.</s> <s sid="54" id="woodmagic.c13.s54">When the spring came again they had still a great deal of talking to do; but whether the young lady was weary of waiting for the marriage-ring, or whether she was jealous of the farmer's mother, or whether she thought they might continue like this for the next ten years if she did not make some effort, or whether it was the worldly counsels of her aunt, or what it was--perhaps her own capricious nature, it is certain that they now began to quarrel a little about another gentleman.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="woodmagic.c13.p16"><s sid="55" id="woodmagic.c13.s55">This gentleman was very rich, and the owner of a large estate in the neighbourhood; he did not often reside there, for he did not care for sport or country life, but once when he came down he happened to see the young lady, and was much attracted towards her.</s> <s sid="56" id="woodmagic.c13.s56">Doubtless she did not mean any harm, but she could not help liking people to admire her, and, not to go into every little particular, in the course of time (and not very long either) she and the gentleman became acquainted.</s> <s sid="57" id="woodmagic.c13.s57">Now, when her own true lover was aware of this, he was so jealous that he swore if ever he saw them together he would shoot his rival with his long-barrelled gun, though he were hung for it the next day.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c13.p17"><s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c13.s58">The lady was not a little pleased at this frantic passion, and secretly liked him ten times better for it, though she immediately resorted to every artifice to calm his anger, for she knew his violent nature, and that he was quite capable of doing as he had said.</s> <s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c13.s59">But the delight of two strings to her bow was not easily to be foregone, and thus, though she really loved the farmer, she did not discourage the gentleman.</s> <s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c13.s60">He, on his part, finding after a while that although she allowed him to talk to her, and even to visit her at the cottage, and sometimes (when she knew the young farmer was at market) go for a walk with him, and once even came and went over his grand mansion, still finding that it was all talk, and that his suit got no further, he presently bethought him of diamonds.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c13.p18"><s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c13.s61">He gave her a most beautiful diamond locket, which he had had down all fresh and brilliant from London.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c13.s62">Now this was the beginning of the mischief.</s> <s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c13.s63">She accepted it in a moment of folly, and wished afterwards ten times that she had refused, but having once put it on, it looked so lovely she could not send it back.</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c13.s64">She could not openly wear it, lest her lover should see it, but every morning she put it on indoors, and frequently glanced in the glass.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c13.p19"><s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c13.s65">Nor is it any use to find fault with her; for in the first place she has been dead many years, and in the second she was then very young, very beautiful, and living quite alone in the world with an old woman.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c13.s66">Now her lover, notwithstanding the sweet assurances she gave him of her faithfulness, and despite the soft kisses he had in abundance every day in the orchard, soft as the bloom of the apple-trees, could not quite recover his peace of mind.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c13.s67">He did not laugh as he used to do.</s> <s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c13.s68">He was restless, and the oneness of his mind was gone.</s> <s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c13.s69">Oneness of mind does not often last long into life, but while it lasts everything is bright.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c13.s70">He had now always a second thought, a doubt behind, which clouded his face and brought a line into his forehead.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="woodmagic.c13.p20"><s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c13.s71">After a time his mother, observing his depression, began to accuse herself of unkindness, and at last resolved to stand no longer in the way of the marriage.</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c13.s72">She determined to quit the house in which she had lived ever since she came to it a happy bride half-a-century before.</s> <s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c13.s73">Having made up her mind, that very morning she walked along the footpath to the young lady's cottage, intending to atone for her former unkindness, and to bring the girl back to lunch, and thus surprise her son when he came in from the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="woodmagic.c13.p21"><s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c13.s74">She had even made up her mind to put up with the cold reception she would probably meet with, nor to reply if any hard words were used towards her.</s> <s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c13.s75">Thus thinking, she lifted the latch, as country people do not use much ceremony, and stepped into the cottage, when what was her surprise to find the girl she had come to see with a beautiful diamond locket about her neck, gleaming in the sunshine from the open door!</s> <s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c13.s76">She instantly understood what it meant, and upbraiding the girl with her falseness, quitted the place, and lost no time in telling her son, but first she took the precaution of hiding his gun.</s> <s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c13.s77">As he could not find that weapon, after the first storm of his jealous anger had gone over he shut himself up in his room.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="woodmagic.c13.p54"><s sid="204" id="woodmagic.c13.s204">Then she thought that perhaps it would be better to give it to him (the farmer), else he might doubt that she had returned it; so she said, as he would not speak to her, she should leave it in the arbour, twisting the ribbon round her letter, and she begged him to throw the locket in the brook, and to believe her once again, or she should be miserable for life.</s> <s sid="205" id="woodmagic.c13.s205">But, if after this he still refused to speak to her, she would still stay a while and endeavour to obtain access to him; and if even then he remained so cruel, there was nothing left for her but to quit the village, and go to some distant relations in France.</s> <s sid="206" id="woodmagic.c13.s206">She would wait, she added, till the new moon shone in the sky, and then she must go, for she could no longer endure the insinuations which were circulated about her.</s> <s sid="207" id="woodmagic.c13.s207">Lest there should be any mistake she enclosed a copy of a note she had sent to the other gentleman, telling him that she should never speak to him again.</s> <s sid="208" id="woodmagic.c13.s208">Finally, she put the address of the village in France to which she was going, and begged and prayed him to write to her.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XIV. THE GREAT BATTLE.</title>
<p pid="1" id="woodmagic.c14.p1"><s sid="1" id="woodmagic.c14.s1">Early the same morning when Kapchack awoke, he was so much refreshed by the sound slumber he had enjoyed, that much of his depression--the sharp edge of his pain as it were--had passed away.</s> <s sid="2" id="woodmagic.c14.s2">The natural vivacity of his disposition asserted itself, and seemed to respond to the glory of the sunshine.</s> <s sid="3" id="woodmagic.c14.s3">Hungry from his long fast, away he flew to well-known places reserved for his own especial feeding-ground, and having satisfied his appetite went up into a hawthorn, trimmed his feathers, and began to think things over.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c14.p2"><s sid="4" id="woodmagic.c14.s4">He at once decided that something of an exceptional character must be attempted in order to regain his authority.</s> <s sid="5" id="woodmagic.c14.s5">Half measures, delays, and intrigues were now in vain; some grand blow must be struck, such as would fill all hearts with admiration or dismay.</s> <s sid="6" id="woodmagic.c14.s6">Another treaty with Choo Hoo was out of the question, for the overbearing rebel would throw in his face the assassination of the envoy, and even could it be thought of, who could he entrust with the mission?</s> <s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c14.s7">His throne was completely surrounded with traitors.</s> <s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c14.s8">He ground his beak as he thought of them, and resolved that terrible indeed should be the vengeance he would take if once he got them again into his power.</s> <s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c14.s9">The hope of revenge was the keenest spur of all to him to adventure something bold and unexpected; the hope of revenge, and the determination that the house of Kapchack should not fall without an effort worthy of a monarch.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c14.p3"><s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c14.s10">He resolved to at once attack the mighty horde Choo Hoo commanded with the only troops he could get quickly together in this emergency.</s> <s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c14.s11">These were the rooks, the praetorian guard of his state, the faithful, courageous, and warlike tenth legion of his empire.</s> <s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c14.s12">No sooner did he thus finally resolve than his whole appearance seemed to change.</s> <s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c14.s13">His outward form in some degree reflected the spirit within.</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c14.s14">His feathers ruffled up, and their black and white shone with new colour.</s> <s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c14.s15">The glossy green of his tail gleamed in the sunshine.</s> <s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c14.s16">One eye indeed was gone, but the other sparkled with the fire of war; he scented the battle, and sharpened his bill against the bough.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="woodmagic.c14.p4"><s sid="17" id="woodmagic.c14.s17">He only regretted that he had not taken this course before, instead of idling in the palace, and leaving his kingdom to the wiles of traitorous courtiers and delegates.</s> <s sid="18" id="woodmagic.c14.s18">If he had only bestirred himself like the ancient Kapchack of former days this extremity would not have arisen.</s> <s sid="19" id="woodmagic.c14.s19">Even yet it was not too late; war was a desperate and uncertain game, and it was not always the greatest army, in point of numbers, that rejoiced in the victory.</s> <s sid="20" id="woodmagic.c14.s20">He would trust in his fortune, and swoop down upon the enemy.</s> <s sid="21" id="woodmagic.c14.s21">Calling to his body-guard, he flew at once straight towards the plain, where, at that time in the morning, he knew the main body of the rooks would be foraging.</s> <s sid="22" id="woodmagic.c14.s22">Full of these resolutions he did not observe the maimed beetle lying helpless in the grass, but looking neither to the right nor the left, taking counsel of no one--for to whom could he apply for honest advice?--he winged his way swiftly onward.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="woodmagic.c14.p5"><s sid="23" id="woodmagic.c14.s23">In about half-an-hour he reached the plain, and saw the rooks scattered over the ground; he rested here upon the lower branch of an elm, and sent forward a messenger, one of the eight magpies who attended him, to tell the commander-in-chief to wait upon him.</s> <s sid="24" id="woodmagic.c14.s24">Upon receiving the message, the general, hoping that at last the king had decided upon action, since so abrupt a summons to his side was somewhat unusual, flew hastily to the elm and saluted the monarch.</s> <s sid="25" id="woodmagic.c14.s25">Kapchack, without any preamble, announced his intention of forming the rooks into column, and falling at once upon the horde of barbarians.</s> <s sid="26" id="woodmagic.c14.s26">In the rooks, he said, and their loyal commander, lay the last hope of the state--he placed himself in their midst and relied upon them solely and alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="woodmagic.c14.p6"><s sid="27" id="woodmagic.c14.s27">Ah Kurroo Khan, the commander-in-chief, could scarcely refrain from shouting with delight.</s> <s sid="28" id="woodmagic.c14.s28">He was not only wild with the joy of coming combat, but this straightforward speech and conduct went to his heart, and never in all his long, long reign had Kapchack so complete and autocratic an empire as at that moment over the rooks.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c14.p7"><s sid="29" id="woodmagic.c14.s29">Ah Kurroo, when he had in some degree expressed his pleasure at these commands, and the readiness with which he placed himself and his army at Kapchack's orders, proceeded first to pass the word to the legions to fall into their ranks, and next to inform the monarch of the position held by the enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="woodmagic.c14.p8"><s sid="30" id="woodmagic.c14.s30">They were, he said, dispersed in all directions foraging, and discipline was much relaxed, insomuch that several bands of them had even fallen to blows amongst themselves.</s> <s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c14.s31">To attack these scattered positions, which could individually be easily overwhelmed, would be a mistake, for these reasons.</s> <s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c14.s32">The advantage of destroying one or two such bands of marauders would be practically nothing, and while it was being accomplished the rest would carry the information to Choo Hoo, and he would assemble his enormous horde.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c14.s33">Thus the chance of surprising and annihilating his army would be lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c14.p9"><s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c14.s34">But it appeared that Choo Hoo's son, Tu Kiu, who was also the second in command of the barbarians, finding that already the country was becoming denuded of supplies close to the camp, had during the previous day, at his father's orders, marched a large division--in itself an immense army--into a plain at a few miles' distance, which was surrounded with the hills, and out of sight from the camp.</s> <s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c14.s35">The best strategy therefore open to Kapchack, was either to assail Choo Hoo's camp, or else to fall upon the divisions of Tu Kiu.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c14.p10"><s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c14.s36">The difficulty in the case of the camp was that amidst the trees the assailants would suffer as much loss from crushing and confusion as would be inflicted upon the enemy.</s> <s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c14.s37">It was impossible, when once involved in a forest conflict, to know which way the issue was tending.</s> <s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c14.s38">The battle became split up into a thousand individual combats, discipline was of no avail, no officer could survey the scene or direct the movements, and a panic at any moment was only too probable.</s> <s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c14.s39">On the other hand, the division of Tu Kiu offered itself for annihilation.</s> <s sid="40" id="woodmagic.c14.s40">It was not only several miles distant from the main body, but a range of hills between prevented all view, and obstructed communication.</s> <s sid="41" id="woodmagic.c14.s41">There was a route by which the plain could be approached, through a narrow valley well sheltered with woods, which would screen the advancing troops from sight, and enable them to debouch at once into the midst of the invaders.</s> <s sid="42" id="woodmagic.c14.s42">Without doubt, thus suddenly attacked, Tu Kiu must give way; should victory declare for them decisively, it was easy to foretell what would happen.</s> <s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c14.s43">Tu Kiu falling back in disorder would confuse the regiments of Choo Hoo coming to his assistance, a panic would arise, and the incredible host of the barbarians would encumber each other's flight.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="woodmagic.c14.p11"><s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c14.s44">Kapchack listened to the Khan with the deepest attention, approved of all he had put forward, and gave the order to attack Tu Kiu.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c14.p12"><s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c14.s45">Without a sound--for Ah Kurroo had strictly enjoined silence, lest the unusual noise should betray that something was intended--the legions fell into rank, and at the word of command, suppressing even the shout of joy which they wished so much to utter, moved in a dense column to the southwards.</s> <s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c14.s46">Kapchack, with his guards behind him, and Ah Kurroo Khan at his side, led the van.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="woodmagic.c14.p13"><s sid="47" id="woodmagic.c14.s47">The Khan secretly congratulated himself as he flew upon his extraordinary good fortune, that he should thus enter the field of battle unhampered with any restrictions, and without the useless and unpleasant companionship of a political officer, appointed by the council of his nation.</s> <s sid="48" id="woodmagic.c14.s48">Well he knew that had Kapchack given the least notice of his intention, the rook council would have assembled and held interminable discussions upon the best method of carrying out the proposed object, ending, as usual, with a vote in which mere numbers prevailed, without any reference to reason or experience, and with the appointment of a state official to overlook the conduct of the general, and to see that he did not arrogate too much to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="woodmagic.c14.p14"><s sid="49" id="woodmagic.c14.s49">Thus in fact the rooks were accustomed to act, lest a commander should become too victorious.</s> <s sid="50" id="woodmagic.c14.s50">They liked indeed to win, and to destroy the enemy, and to occupy his territory, but they did not like all this to be accomplished by one man, but the rather, at the very zenith of his fame, provided him with an opportunity for disgracing himself, so that another might take his place and divide the glory.</s> <s sid="51" id="woodmagic.c14.s51">Ah Kurroo knew all this; imagine, then, his joy that Kapchack without calling parliament together had come direct to the camp, and ordered an immediate advance.</s> <s sid="52" id="woodmagic.c14.s52">Himself choosing the route, trusting to no guides, not even to his own intelligence department, Ah Kurroo pointed the way, and the legions with steady and unvarying flight followed their renowned commander.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="woodmagic.c14.p15"><s sid="53" id="woodmagic.c14.s53">The noise of their wings resounded, the air was oppressed with their weight and the mighty mass in motion.</s> <s sid="54" id="woodmagic.c14.s54">Then did Kapchack indeed feel himself every feather a king.</s> <s sid="55" id="woodmagic.c14.s55">He glanced back--he could not see the rear-guard, so far did the host extend.</s> <s sid="56" id="woodmagic.c14.s56">His heart swelled with pride and eagerness for the fight.</s> <s sid="57" id="woodmagic.c14.s57">Now quitting the plain, they wound by a devious route through the hills--the general's object being to so manage the march that none of them should appear above the ridges.</s> <s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c14.s58">The woods upon the slopes concealed their motions, and the advance was executed without the least delay, though so great was their length in this extended order that when the head of the column entered the plain beyond, the rear-guard had not reached the hills behind.</s> <s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c14.s59">This rendered their front extremely narrow, but Ah Kurroo, pausing when he had gone half-a-mile into the plain, and when the enemy were already in sight, and actually beneath them, ordered the leading ranks to beat time with their wings, while their comrades came up.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="woodmagic.c14.p16"><s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c14.s60">Thus, in a few minutes, the place where the narrow valley debouched into the hill-surrounded plain, was darkened with the deploying rooks.</s> <s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c14.s61">Kapchack, while waiting, saw beneath him the hurrying squadrons of Tu Kiu.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c14.s62">From the cut corn, from the stubble, from the furrows (where already the plough had begun its work), from the green roots and second crops of clover, from the slopes of the hills around, and the distant ridges, the alarmed warriors were crowding to their standards.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c14.p17"><s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c14.s63">While peacefully foraging, happy in the sunshine and the abundance of food, without a thought of war and war's hazards, they suddenly found themselves exposed, all unprepared, to the fell assault of their black and mortal enemies.</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c14.s64">The sky above them seemed darkened with the legions, the hoarse shouts of command as the officers deployed their ranks, the beating of the air, struck them with terror.</s> <s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c14.s65">Some, indeed, overwhelmed with affright, cowered on the earth; a few of the outlying bands, who had wandered farthest, turned tail and fled over the ridges.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c14.s66">But the majority, veterans in fight, though taken aback, and fully recognising the desperate circumstances under which they found themselves, hastened with all speed towards Tu Kiu, whose post was in a hedge, in which stood three low ash-trees by a barn.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c14.s67">This was about the centre of the plain, and thither the squadrons and companies hurried, hoarsely shouting for their general.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c14.p18"><s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c14.s68">Tu Kiu, undismayed, and brave as became the son and heir of the mighty Emperor Choo Hoo, made the greatest efforts to get them into some kind of array and order.</s> <s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c14.s69">Most fell into rank of their own accord from long use and habit, but the misfortune was that no sooner had one regiment formed than fresh arrivals coming up threw all into disorder again.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c14.s70">The crowd, the countless multitude overwhelmed itself; the air was filled, the earth covered, they struck against each other, and Tu Kiu, hoarse with shouting, was borne down, and the branch of ash upon which he stood broken with the weight of his own men.</s> <s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c14.s71">He struggled, he called, he cried; his voice was lost in the din and clangour.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c14.p19"><s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c14.s72">Ah Kurroo Khan, soaring with Kapchack, while the legions deployed, marked the immense confusion of the enemy's centre.</s> <s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c14.s73">He seized the moment, gave the command, and in one grand charge the whole army bore swiftly down upon Tu Kiu.</s> <s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c14.s74">Kapchack himself could scarce keep pace with the increasing velocity of the charge; he was wrapped, as it were, around with the dense and serried ranks, and found himself hurled in a moment into the heart of the fight.</s> <s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c14.s75">Fight, indeed, it could not be called.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="woodmagic.c14.p20"><s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c14.s76">The solid phalanx of the rooks swept through the confused multitude before them, by their mere momentum cutting it completely in two, and crushing innumerable combatants underneath.</s> <s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c14.s77">In a minute, in less than a minute, the mighty host of Tu Kiu, the flower of Choo Hoo's army, was swept from the earth.</s> <s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c14.s78">He himself, wounded and half-stunned by the shock, was assisted from the scene by the unwearied efforts of his personal attendants.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="woodmagic.c14.p21"><s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c14.s79">Each tried to save himself regardless of the rest; the oldest veteran, appalled by such utter defeat, could not force himself to turn again and gather about the leaders.</s> <s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c14.s80">One mass of fugitives filled the air; the slopes of the hills were covered with them.</s> <s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c14.s81">Still the solid phalanx of Kapchack pressed their rear, pushing them before it.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="woodmagic.c14.p22"><s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c14.s82">Tu Kiu, who, weary and faint, had alighted for a moment upon an ancient grass-grown earthwork--a memorial of former wars--which crowned a hill, found it necessary to again flee with his utmost speed, lest he should be taken captive.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="woodmagic.c14.p23"><s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c14.s83">It was now that the genius of Ah Kurroo Khan showed itself in its most brilliant aspect.</s> <s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c14.s84">Kapchack, intoxicated with battle, hurried the legions on to the slaughter--it was only by personal interference that the Khan could restrain the excited king.</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c14.s85">Ah Kurroo, calm and far-seeing in the very moment of victory, restrained the legions, held them in, and not without immense exertion succeeded in checking the pursuit, and retaining the phalanx in good order.</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c14.s86">To follow a host so completely routed was merely to slay the slain, and to waste the strength that might profitably be employed elsewhere.</s> <s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c14.s87">He conjectured that so soon as ever the news reached Choo Hoo, the emperor, burning with indignation, would arouse his camp, call his army together, and without waiting to rally Tu Kiu's division, fly immediately to retrieve this unexpected disaster.</s> <s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c14.s88">Thus, the victors must yet face a second enemy, far more numerous than the first, under better generalship, and prepared for the conflict.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="woodmagic.c14.p24"><s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c14.s89">Ah Kurroo was, even now, by no means certain of the ultimate result.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c14.s90">The rooks, indeed, were flushed with success, and impelled with all the vigour of victory; their opponents, however brave, must in some degree feel the depression attendant upon serious loss.</s> <s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c14.s91">But the veterans with Choo Hoo not only outnumbered them, and could easily outflank or entirely surround, but would also be under the influence of his personal leadership.</s> <s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c14.s92">They looked upon Choo Hoo, not as their king, or their general only, but as their prophet, and thus the desperate valour of fanaticism must be reckoned in addition to their natural courage.</s> <s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c14.s93">Instead, therefore, of relying simply upon force, Ah Kurroo, even in the excitement of the battle, formed new schemes, and aimed to out-general the emperor.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="woodmagic.c14.p25"><s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c14.s94">He foresaw that Choo Hoo would at once march to the attack, and would come straight as a line to the battle-field.</s> <s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c14.s95">His plan was to wheel round, and, making a detour, escape the shock of Choo Hoo's army for the moment, and while Choo Hoo was looking for the legions that had overthrown his son, to fall upon and occupy his undefended camp.</s> <s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c14.s96">He was in hopes that when the barbarians found their rear threatened, and their camp in possession of the enemy, a panic would seize upon them.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c14.p26"><s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c14.s97">Kapchack, when he had a little recovered from the frenzy of the fray, fully concurred, and without a minute's delay Ah Kurroo proceeded to carry out this strategical operation.</s> <s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c14.s98">He drew off the legions for some distance by the same route they had come, and then, considering that he had gone far enough to avoid Choo Hoo, turned sharp to the left, and flew straight for the emperor's camp, sheltered from view on the side towards it by a wood, and in front by an isolated hill, also crowned with trees.</s> <s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c14.s99">Once over that hill, and Choo Hoo's camp must inevitably fall into their hands.</s> <s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c14.s100">With swift, steady flight, the dark legions approached the hill, and were now within half-a-mile of it, when to Ah Kurroo's surprise and mortification the van-guard of Choo Hoo appeared above it, advancing directly upon them.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="woodmagic.c14.p27"><s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c14.s101">When the fugitives from the field of battle reached Choo Hoo, he could at first scarce restrain his indignation, for he had deemed the treaty in full force; he exclaimed against the perfidy of a Power which called itself civilised and reproached his host as barbarians, yet thus violated its solemn compacts.</s> <s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c14.s102">But recognising the gravity of the situation, and that there was no time to waste in words, he gave orders for the immediate assembly of his army, and while the officers carried out his command flew to a lofty fir to consider a few moments alone upon the course he should take.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="woodmagic.c17.p2"><s sid="4" id="woodmagic.c17.s4">The road passed not far from the copse, and Bevis heard the woodpecker say something, but he was too busy touching up the horses with the carter's long whip to pay any heed.</s> <s sid="5" id="woodmagic.c17.s5">If he had been permitted he would have lashed them into a sharp trot.</s> <s sid="6" id="woodmagic.c17.s6">Every now and then Bevis turned round to give the bailiff a sly flick with the whip; the bailiff sat at the tail and dangled his legs over behind, so that his broad back was a capital thing to hit.</s> <s sid="7" id="woodmagic.c17.s7">By-and-by, the carter left the highway and took the waggon along a lane where the ruts were white with chalk, and which wound round at the foot of the downs.</s> <s sid="8" id="woodmagic.c17.s8">Then after surmounting a steep hill, where the lane had worn a deep hollow, they found a plain with hills all round it, and here, close to the sward, was the straw-rick from which they were to load.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="woodmagic.c17.p3"><s sid="9" id="woodmagic.c17.s9">Bevis insisted upon building the load, that is putting the straw in its place when it was thrown up; but in three minutes he said he hated it, it was so hot and scratchy, so out he jumped.</s> <s sid="10" id="woodmagic.c17.s10">Then he ran a little way up the green sward of the hill, and lying down rolled over and over to the bottom.</s> <s sid="11" id="woodmagic.c17.s11">Next he wandered along the low hedge dividing the stubble from the sward, so low that he could jump over it, but as he could not find anything he came back, and at last so teased and worried his papa to let him go up to the top of the hill, that he consented, on Bevis promising in the most solemn manner that he would not go one single inch beyond the summit, where there was an ancient earthwork.</s> <s sid="12" id="woodmagic.c17.s12">Bevis promised, and his eyes looked so clear and truthful, and his cheek so rosy and innocent, and his lips so red and pouting, that no one could choose but believe him.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="woodmagic.c17.p4"><s sid="13" id="woodmagic.c17.s13">Away he ran thirty yards up the hill at a burst, but it soon became so steep he had to stay and climb slowly.</s> <s sid="14" id="woodmagic.c17.s14">Five minutes afterwards he began to find it very hard work indeed, though it looked so easy from below, and stopped to rest.</s> <s sid="15" id="woodmagic.c17.s15">He turned round and looked down; he could see over the waggon and the straw-rick, over the ash-trees in the hedges, over the plain (all yellow with stubble) across to the hills on the other side, and there, through a gap in them, it seemed as if the land suddenly ceased, or dropped down, and beyond was a dark blue expanse which ended in the sky where the sky came down to touch it.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="woodmagic.c17.p5"><s sid="16" id="woodmagic.c17.s16">By his feet was a rounded boulder-stone, brown and smooth, a hard sarsen; this he tried to move, but it was so heavy that he could but just stir it.</s> <s sid="17" id="woodmagic.c17.s17">But the more difficult a thing was, or the more he was resisted, the more determined Bevis always became.</s> <s sid="18" id="woodmagic.c17.s18">He would stamp and shout with rage, rather than let a thing alone quietly.</s> <s sid="19" id="woodmagic.c17.s19">When he did this sometimes Pan, the spaniel, would look at him in amazement, and wonder why he did not leave it and go on and do something else, as the world was so big, and there were very many easy things that could be done without any trouble.</s> <s sid="20" id="woodmagic.c17.s20">That was not Bevis's idea, however, at all; he never quitted a thing till he had done it.</s> <s sid="21" id="woodmagic.c17.s21">And so he tugged and strained and struggled with the stone till he got it out of its bed and on the sloping sward.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="woodmagic.c17.p6"><s sid="22" id="woodmagic.c17.s22">Then he pushed and heaved at it, till it began to roll, and giving it a final thrust with his foot, away it went, at first rumbling and rolling slowly, and then faster and with a thumping, till presently it bounded and leaped ten yards at a time, and at the bottom of the hill sprang over the hedge like a hunter, and did not stop till it had gone twenty yards out into the stubble towards the straw-rick.</s> <s sid="23" id="woodmagic.c17.s23">Bevis laughed and shouted, though a little disappointed that it had not smashed the waggon, or at least jumped over it.</s> <s sid="24" id="woodmagic.c17.s24">Then, waving his hat, away he went again, now picking up a flint to fling as far down as he could, now kicking over a white round puff ball--always up, up, till he grew hot, and his breath came in quick deep pants.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="woodmagic.c17.p7"><s sid="25" id="woodmagic.c17.s25">But still as determined as ever, he pushed on, and presently stood on the summit, on the edge of the fosse.</s> <s sid="26" id="woodmagic.c17.s26">He looked down; the waggon seemed under his feet; the plain, the hills beyond, the blue distant valley on one side, on the other the ridge he had mounted stretched away, and beyond it still more ridges, till he could see no further.</s> <s sid="27" id="woodmagic.c17.s27">He went into the fosse, and there it seemed so pleasant that he sat down, and in a minute lay extended at full length in his favourite position, looking up at the sky.</s> <s sid="28" id="woodmagic.c17.s28">It was much more blue than he had ever seen it before, and it seemed only just over his head; the grasshoppers called in the grass at his side, and he could hear a lark sing, singing far away, but on a level with him.</s> <s sid="29" id="woodmagic.c17.s29">First he thought he would talk to the grasshopper, or call to one of the swallows, but he had now got over the effort of climbing, and he could not sit still.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="woodmagic.c17.p8"><s sid="30" id="woodmagic.c17.s30">Up he jumped, ran up the rampart, and then down again into the fosse.</s> <s sid="31" id="woodmagic.c17.s31">He liked the trench best, and ran along it in the hollow, picking up stray flints and throwing them as far as he could.</s> <s sid="32" id="woodmagic.c17.s32">The trench wound round the hill, and presently when he saw a low hawthorn-bush just outside the broad green ditch, and scrambled up to it, the waggon was gone and the plain, for he had reached the other side of the camp.</s> <s sid="33" id="woodmagic.c17.s33">There the top of the hill was level and broad: a beautiful place for a walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="woodmagic.c17.p9"><s sid="34" id="woodmagic.c17.s34">Bevis went a little way out upon it, and the turf was so soft, and seemed to push up his foot so, that he must go on, and when he had got a little farther, he heard another grasshopper, and thought he would run and catch him; but the grasshopper, who had heard of his tricks, stopped singing, and hid in a bunch, so that Bevis could not see him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="woodmagic.c17.p10"><s sid="35" id="woodmagic.c17.s35">Next he saw a little round hill--a curious little hill--not very much higher than his own head, green with grass and smooth.</s> <s sid="36" id="woodmagic.c17.s36">This curious little hill greatly pleased him; he would have liked to have had it carried down into his garden at home; he ran up on the top of it, and shouted at the sun, and danced round on the tumulus.</s> <s sid="37" id="woodmagic.c17.s37">A third grasshopper called in the grass, and Bevis ran down after him, but he, too, was too cunning; then a glossy ball of thistledown came up so silently, Bevis did not see it till it touched him, and lingered a moment lovingly against his shoulder.</s> <s sid="38" id="woodmagic.c17.s38">Before he could grasp it, it was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="woodmagic.c17.p11"><s sid="39" id="woodmagic.c17.s39">A few steps farther and he found a track crossing the hill, waggon-ruts in the turf, and ran along it a little way--only a little way, for he did not care for anything straight.</s> <s sid="40" id="woodmagic.c17.s40">Next he saw a mushroom, and gathered it, and while hunting about hither and thither for another, came upon some boulder-stones, like the one he had hurled down the slope, but very much larger, big enough to play hide-and-seek behind.</s> <s sid="41" id="woodmagic.c17.s41">He danced round these--Bevis could not walk--and after he had danced round every one, and peered under and climbed over one or two, he discovered that they were put in a circle.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="woodmagic.c17.p12"><s sid="42" id="woodmagic.c17.s42">"Somebody's been at play here," thought Bevis, and looking round to see who had been placing the stones in a ring, he saw a flock of rooks far off in the air, even higher up than he was on the hill, wheeling about, soaring round with outspread wings and cawing.</s> <s sid="43" id="woodmagic.c17.s43">They slipped past each other in and out, tracing a maze, and rose up, drifting away slowly as they rose; they were so happy, they danced in the sky.</s> <s sid="44" id="woodmagic.c17.s44">Bevis ran along the hill in the same direction they were going, shouting and waving his hand to them, and they cawed to him in return.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="woodmagic.c17.p13"><s sid="45" id="woodmagic.c17.s45">When he looked to see where he was he was now in the midst of long mounds or heaps of flints that had been dug and stacked; he jumped on them, and off again, picked up the best for throwing, and flung them as far as he could.</s> <s sid="46" id="woodmagic.c17.s46">There was a fir-copse but a little distance farther, he went to it, but the trees grew so close together he could not go through, so he walked round it, and then the ground declined so gently he did not notice he was going downhill.</s> <s sid="47" id="woodmagic.c17.s47">At the bottom there was a wood of the strangest old twisted oaks he had ever seen; not the least like the oak-trees by his house at home that he knew so well.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="woodmagic.c17.p14"><s sid="48" id="woodmagic.c17.s48">These were short, and so very knotty that even the trunks, thick as they were, seemed all knots, and the limbs were gnarled, and shaggy with grey lichen.</s> <s sid="49" id="woodmagic.c17.s49">He threw pieces of dead stick, which he found on the ground, up at the acorns, but they were not yet ripe, so he wandered on among the oaks, tapping every one he passed to see which was hollow, till presently he had gone so far he could not see the hills for the boughs.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="woodmagic.c17.p15"><s sid="50" id="woodmagic.c17.s50">But just as he was thinking he would ask a bee to show him the way out (for there was not a single bird in the wood), he came to a place where the oaks were thinner, and the space between them was covered with bramble-bushes.</s> <s sid="51" id="woodmagic.c17.s51">Some of the blackberries were ripe, and his lips were soon stained with their juice.</s> <s sid="52" id="woodmagic.c17.s52">Passing on from bramble-thicket to bramble-thicket, by-and-by he shouted, and danced, and clapped his hands with joy, for there were some nuts on a hazel bough, and they were ripe he was sure, for the side towards the sun was rosy.</s> <s sid="53" id="woodmagic.c17.s53">He knew that nuts do not get brown first, but often turn red towards the south.</s> <s sid="54" id="woodmagic.c17.s54">Out came his pocket-knife, and with seven tremendous slashes, for Bevis could not do anything steadily, off came a branch with a crook.</s> <s sid="55" id="woodmagic.c17.s55">He crooked down the bough and gathered the nuts, there were eight on that bough, and on the next four, and on the next only two.</s> <s sid="56" id="woodmagic.c17.s56">But there was another stole beyond, from which, in a minute, he had twenty more, and then as he could not stay to crack them, he crammed them into his pocket and ceased to reckon.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="woodmagic.c17.p16"><s sid="57" id="woodmagic.c17.s57">"I will take fifty up to the squirrel," he said to himself, "and the nut-crackers, and show him how to do it properly with some salt."</s> <s sid="58" id="woodmagic.c17.s58">So he tugged at the boughs, and dragged them down, and went on from stole to stole till he had roamed into the depths of the nut-tree wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="woodmagic.c17.p17"><s sid="59" id="woodmagic.c17.s59">Then, as he stopped a second to step over a little streamlet that oozed along at his feet, all at once he became aware how still it was.</s> <s sid="60" id="woodmagic.c17.s60">No birds sang, and no jay called; no woodpecker chuckled; there was not even a robin; nor had he seen a rabbit, or a squirrel, or a dragon-fly, or any of his friends.</s> <s sid="61" id="woodmagic.c17.s61">Already the outer rim of some of the hazel leaves was brown, while the centre of the leaf remained green, but there was not even the rustle of a leaf as it fell.</s> <s sid="62" id="woodmagic.c17.s62">The larks were not here, nor the swallows, nor the rooks; the streamlet at his feet went on without a murmur; and the breeze did not come down into the hollow.</s> <s sid="63" id="woodmagic.c17.s63">Except for a bee, whose buzz seemed quite loud as he flew by, there was not a moving thing.</s> <s sid="64" id="woodmagic.c17.s64">Bevis was alone; he had never before been so utterly alone, and he stopped humming the old tune the brook had taught him, to listen.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="woodmagic.c17.p18"><s sid="65" id="woodmagic.c17.s65">He lifted his crook and struck the water; it splashed, but in a second it was still again.</s> <s sid="66" id="woodmagic.c17.s66">He flung a dead branch into a tree; it cracked as it hit a bough, on which the leaves rustled; then it fell thump, and lay still and quiet.</s> <s sid="67" id="woodmagic.c17.s67">He stamped on the ground, the grass gave no sound.</s> <s sid="68" id="woodmagic.c17.s68">He shouted "Holloa!" but there was no echo.</s> <s sid="69" id="woodmagic.c17.s69">His voice seemed to slip away from him, he could not shout so loud as he had been accustomed to.</s> <s sid="70" id="woodmagic.c17.s70">For a minute he liked it; then he began to think it was not so pleasant; then he wanted to get out, but he could not see the hill, so he did not know which way to go.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="woodmagic.c17.p19"><s sid="71" id="woodmagic.c17.s71">So he stroked a knotted oak with his hand, smoothing it down, and said:</s> <s sid="72" id="woodmagic.c17.s72">"Oak, oak, tell me which way to go!" and the oak tried to speak, but there was no wind, and he could not, but he dropped just one leaf on the right side, and Bevis picked it up, and as he did so, a nut-tree bough brushed his cheek.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="woodmagic.c17.p20"><s sid="73" id="woodmagic.c17.s73">He kissed the bough, and said:</s> <s sid="74" id="woodmagic.c17.s74">"Nut-tree bough, nut-tree bough, tell me the way to go!"</s> <s sid="75" id="woodmagic.c17.s75">The bough could not speak for the same reason that the oak could not; but it bent down towards the streamlet.</s> <s sid="76" id="woodmagic.c17.s76">Bevis dropped on one knee and lifted up a little water in the hollow of his hand, and drank it, and asked which way to go.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="woodmagic.c17.p21"><s sid="77" id="woodmagic.c17.s77">The stream could not speak because there was no stone to splash against, but it sparkled in the sunshine (as Bevis had pushed the bough aside), and looked so pleasant that he followed it a little way, and then he came to an open place with twisted old oaks, gnarled and knotted, where a blue butterfly was playing.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="woodmagic.c17.p22"><s sid="78" id="woodmagic.c17.s78">"Show me the way out, you beautiful creature," said Bevis.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="woodmagic.c17.p23"><s sid="79" id="woodmagic.c17.s79">"So I will, Bevis dear," said the butterfly.</s> <s sid="80" id="woodmagic.c17.s80">"I have just come from your waggon, and your papa and the bailiff have been calling to you, and I think they will soon be coming back to look for you.</s> <s sid="81" id="woodmagic.c17.s81">Follow me, my darling."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="woodmagic.c17.p24"><s sid="82" id="woodmagic.c17.s82">So Bevis followed the little blue butterfly, who danced along as straight as it was possible for him to go, for he, like Bevis, did not like too much straightness.</s> <s sid="83" id="woodmagic.c17.s83">Now the oak knew the butterfly was there, and that was why he dropped his leaf; and so did the nut-tree bough, and that was why he drooped and let the sun sparkle on the water, and the stream smiled to make Bevis follow him to where the butterfly was playing.</s> <s sid="84" id="woodmagic.c17.s84">Without pausing anywhere, but just zig-zagging on, the blue butterfly floated before Bevis, who danced after him, the nuts falling from his crammed pockets; knocking every oak as he went with his stick, asking them if they knew anything, or had anything to tell the people in the copse near his house.</s> <s sid="85" id="woodmagic.c17.s85">The oaks were bursting with things to tell him, and messages to send, but they could not speak, as there was no breeze in the hollow.</s> <s sid="86" id="woodmagic.c17.s86">He whipped the bramble bushes with his crook, but they did not mind in the least, they were so glad to see him.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="woodmagic.c17.p25"><s sid="87" id="woodmagic.c17.s87">He whistled to the butterfly to stop a moment while he picked a blackberry; the butterfly settled on a leaf.</s> <s sid="88" id="woodmagic.c17.s88">Then away they went again together till they left the wood behind and began to go up the hill.</s> <s sid="89" id="woodmagic.c17.s89">There the butterfly grew restless, and could scarce restrain his pace for Bevis to keep up, as they were now in the sunshine.</s> <s sid="90" id="woodmagic.c17.s90">Bevis raced after as fast as he could go uphill, but at the top the butterfly thought he saw a friend of his, and telling Bevis that somebody would come to him in a minute, away he flew.</s> <s sid="91" id="woodmagic.c17.s91">Bevis looked round, but it was all strange and new to him; there were hills all round, but there was no waggon, and no old trench or rampart; nothing but the blue sky and the great sun, which did not seem far off.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="woodmagic.c17.p26"><s sid="92" id="woodmagic.c17.s92">While he wondered which way to go, the wind came along the ridge, and taking him softly by the ear pushed him gently forward and said:</s> <s sid="93" id="woodmagic.c17.s93">"Bevis, my love, I have been waiting for you ever so long; why did you not come before?"</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="woodmagic.c17.p27"><s sid="94" id="woodmagic.c17.s94">"Because you never asked me," said Bevis.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="woodmagic.c17.p28"><s sid="95" id="woodmagic.c17.s95">"Oh yes, I did; I asked you twenty times in the copse.</s> <s sid="96" id="woodmagic.c17.s96">I beckoned to you out of the great oak, under which you went to sleep; and I whispered to you from the fir-trees where the squirrel played, but you were so busy, dear, so busy with Kapchack, and the war, and Choo Hoo, and the court, and all the turmoil, that you did not hear me."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="woodmagic.c17.p29"><s sid="97" id="woodmagic.c17.s97">"You should have called louder," said Bevis.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="woodmagic.c17.p30"><s sid="98" id="woodmagic.c17.s98">"So I did," said the wind.</s> <s sid="99" id="woodmagic.c17.s99">"Don't you remember I whirled the little bough against your window, and rattled the casement that night you saw the owl go by?"</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="woodmagic.c17.p31"><s sid="100" id="woodmagic.c17.s100">"I was so sleepy," said Bevis, "I did not know what you meant; you should have kissed me."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="woodmagic.c17.p32"><s sid="101" id="woodmagic.c17.s101">"So I did," said the wind.</s> <s sid="102" id="woodmagic.c17.s102">"I kissed you a hundred times out in the field, and stroked your hair, but you would not take any notice."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="woodmagic.c17.p33"><s sid="103" id="woodmagic.c17.s103">"I had so much to do," said Bevis; "there was the weasel and my cannon-stick."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="woodmagic.c17.p34"><s sid="104" id="woodmagic.c17.s104">"But I wanted you very much," said the wind, "because I love you, and longed for you to come and visit me."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="woodmagic.c17.p35"><s sid="105" id="woodmagic.c17.s105">"Well, now I am come," said Bevis.</s> <s sid="106" id="woodmagic.c17.s106">"But where do you live?"</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="woodmagic.c17.p36"><s sid="107" id="woodmagic.c17.s107">"This is where I live, dear," said the wind.</s> <s sid="108" id="woodmagic.c17.s108">"I live upon the hill; sometimes I go to the sea, and sometimes to the woods, and sometimes I run through the valley, but I always come back here, and you may always be sure of finding me here; and I want you to come and romp with me."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="woodmagic.c17.p37"><s sid="109" id="woodmagic.c17.s109">"I will come," said Bevis; "I like a romp, but are you very rough?"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="woodmagic.c17.p38"><s sid="110" id="woodmagic.c17.s110">"Oh no, dear; not with you."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="woodmagic.c17.p39"><s sid="111" id="woodmagic.c17.s111">"I am a great big boy," said Bevis; "I am eating my peck of salt very fast:</s> <s sid="112" id="woodmagic.c17.s112">I shall soon get too big to romp with you.</s> <s sid="113" id="woodmagic.c17.s113">How old are you, you jolly Wind?"</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="woodmagic.c17.p40"><s sid="114" id="woodmagic.c17.s114">The wind laughed and said:</s> <s sid="115" id="woodmagic.c17.s115">"I am older than all the very old things.</s> <s sid="116" id="woodmagic.c17.s116">I am as old as the brook."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="woodmagic.c17.p41"><s sid="117" id="woodmagic.c17.s117">"But the brook is very old," said Bevis.</s> <s sid="118" id="woodmagic.c17.s118">"He told me he was older than the hills, so I do not think you are as old as he is."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="woodmagic.c17.p42"><s sid="119" id="woodmagic.c17.s119">"Yes I am," said the wind; "he was always my playfellow; we were children together."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="woodmagic.c17.p43"><s sid="120" id="woodmagic.c17.s120">"If you are so very, very old," said Bevis, "it is no use your trying to romp with me, because I am very strong; I can carry my papa's gun on my shoulder, and I can run very fast; do you know the stupid old bailiff can't catch me?</s> <s sid="121" id="woodmagic.c17.s121">I can go round the ricks ever so much quicker than he can."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="woodmagic.c17.p44"><s sid="122" id="woodmagic.c17.s122">"I can run quick," said the wind.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="woodmagic.c17.p45"><s sid="123" id="woodmagic.c17.s123">"But not so quick as me," said Bevis; "now see if you can catch me."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="woodmagic.c17.p46"><s sid="124" id="woodmagic.c17.s124">Away he ran, and for a moment he left the wind behind; but the wind blew a little faster, and overtook him, and they raced along together, like two wild things, till Bevis began to pant.</s> <s sid="125" id="woodmagic.c17.s125">Then down he sat on the turf and kicked up his heels and shouted, and the wind fanned his cheek and cooled him, and kissed his lips and stroked his hair, and caressed him and played with him, till up he jumped again and danced along, the wind always pushing him gently.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="woodmagic.c17.p47"><s sid="126" id="woodmagic.c17.s126">"You are a jolly old Wind," said Bevis, "I like you very much; but you must tell me a story, else we shall quarrel.</s> <s sid="127" id="woodmagic.c17.s127">I'm sure we shall."</s> </p>
