<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c0.p1"><s>PREFACE.</s> <s>PREFACE TO THE BIOGRAPHICAL EDITION</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c0.p2"><s>While my husband and Mr. Henley were engaged in writing plays in Bournemouth they made a number of titles, hoping to use them in the future.</s> <s>Dramatic composition was not what my husband preferred, but the torrent of Mr. Henley's enthusiasm swept him off his feet.</s> <s>However, after several plays had been finished, and his health seriously impaired by his endeavours to keep up with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned forever, and my husband returned to his legitimate vocation.</s> <s>Having added one of the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected plays, now thrown aside, and emboldened by my husband's offer to give me any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c0.p3"><s>As I wanted a trial scene in the Old Bailey, I chose the period of 1700 for my purpose; but being shamefully ignorant of my subject, and my husband confessing to little more knowledge than I possessed, a London bookseller was commissioned to send us everything he could procure bearing on Old Bailey trials.</s> <s>A great package came in response to our order, and very soon we were both absorbed, not so much in the trials as in following the brilliant career of a Mr. Garrow, who appeared as counsel in many of the cases.</s> <s>We sent for more books, and yet more, still intent on Mr. Garrow, whose subtle cross-examination of witnesses and masterly, if sometimes startling, methods of arriving at the truth seemed more thrilling to us than any novel.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c0.p4"><s>Occasionally other trials than those of the Old Bailey would be included in the package of books we received from London; among these my husband found and read with avidity:--</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c0.p5"><s>THE TRIAL OF JAMES STEWART in Aucharn in Duror of Appin FOR THE Murder of COLIN CAMPBELL of Glenure, Efq; Factor for His Majefty on the forfeited Estate of Ardfhiel.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c0.p6"><s>My husband was always interested in this period of his country's history, and had already the intention of writing a story that should turn on the Appin murder.</s> <s>The tale was to be of a boy, David Balfour, supposed to belong to my husband's own family, who should travel in Scotland as though it were a foreign country, meeting with various adventures and misadventures by the way.</s> <s>From the trial of James Stewart my husband gleaned much valuable material for his novel, the most important being the character of Alan Breck.</s> <s>Aside from having described him as "smallish in stature," my husband seems to have taken Alan Breck's personal appearance, even to his clothing, from the book.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c0.p7"><s>A letter from James Stewart to Mr. John Macfarlane, introduced as evidence in the trial, says:</s> <s>"There is one Alan Stewart, a distant friend of the late Ardshiel's, who is in the French service, and came over in March last, as he said to some, in order to settle at home; to others, that he was to go soon back; and was, as I hear, the day that the murder was committed, seen not far from the place where it happened, and is not now to be seen; by which it is believed he was the actor.</s> <s>He is a desperate foolish fellow; and if he is guilty, came to the country for that very purpose.</s> <s>He is a tall, pock-pitted lad, very black hair, and wore a blue coat and metal buttons, an old red vest, and breeches of the same colour."</s> <s>A second witness testified to having seen him wearing "a blue coat with silver buttons, a red waistcoat, black shag breeches, tartan hose, and a feathered hat, with a big coat, dun coloured," a costume referred to by one of the counsel as "French cloathes which were remarkable."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c0.p8"><s>There are many incidents given in the trial that point to Alan's fiery spirit and Highland quickness to take offence.</s> <s>One witness "declared also That the said Alan Breck threatened that he would challenge Ballieveolan and his sons to fight because of his removing the declarant last year from Glenduror."</s> <s>On another page:</s> <s>"Duncan Campbell, change-keeper at Annat, aged thirty-five years, married, witness cited, sworn, purged and examined ut supra, depones, That, in the month of April last, the deponent met with Alan Breck Stewart, with whom he was not acquainted, and John Stewart, in Auchnacoan, in the house of the walk miller of Auchofragan, and went on with them to the house:</s> <s>Alan Breck Stewart said, that he hated all the name of Campbell; and the deponent said, he had no reason for doing so:</s> <s>But Alan said, he had very good reason for it: that thereafter they left that house; and, after drinking a dram at another house, came to the deponent's house, where they went in, and drunk some drams, and Alan Breck renewed the former Conversation; and the deponent, making the same answer, Alan said, that, if the deponent had any respect for his friends, he would tell them, that if they offered to turn out the possessors of Ardshiel's estate, he would make black cocks of them, before they entered into possession by which the deponent understood shooting them, it being a common phrase in the country."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c0.p9"><s>Some time after the publication of Kidnapped we stopped for a short while in the Appin country, where we were surprised and interested to discover that the feeling concerning the murder of Glenure (the "Red Fox," also called "Colin Roy") was almost as keen as though the tragedy had taken place the day before.</s> <s>For several years my husband received letters of expostulation or commendation from members of the Campbell and Stewart clans.</s> <s>I have in my possession a paper, yellow with age, that was sent soon after the novel appeared, containing "The Pedigree of the Family of Appine," wherein it is said that "Alan 3rd Baron of Appine was not killed at Flowdoun, tho there, but lived to a great old age.</s> <s>He married Cameron Daughter to Ewen Cameron of Lochiel."</s> <s>Following this is a paragraph stating that "John Stewart 1st of Ardsheall of his descendants Alan Breck had better be omitted.</s> <s>Duncan Baan Stewart in Achindarroch his father was a Bastard."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c0.p10"><s>One day, while my husband was busily at work, I sat beside him reading an old cookery book called The Compleat Housewife: or Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion.</s> <s>In the midst of receipts for "Rabbits, and Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, Skirret Pye, Baked Tansy," and other forgotten delicacies, there were directions for the preparation of several lotions for the preservation of beauty.</s> <s>One of these was so charming that I interrupted my husband to read it aloud.</s> <s>"Just what I wanted!" he exclaimed; and the receipt for the "Lily of the Valley Water" was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c0.p12"><s>DEDICATION</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c0.p13"><s>MY DEAR CHARLES BAXTER:</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c0.p14"><s>If you ever read this tale, you will likely ask yourself more questions than I should care to answer: as for instance how the Appin murder has come to fall in the year 1751, how the Torran rocks have crept so near to Earraid, or why the printed trial is silent as to all that touches David Balfour.</s> <s>These are nuts beyond my ability to crack.</s> <s>But if you tried me on the point of Alan's guilt or innocence, I think I could defend the reading of the text.</s> <s>To this day you will find the tradition of Appin clear in Alan's favour.</s> <s>If you inquire, you may even hear that the descendants of "the other man" who fired the shot are in the country to this day.</s> <s>But that other man's name, inquire as you please, you shall not hear; for the Highlander values a secret for itself and for the congenial exercise of keeping it.</s> <s>I might go on for long to justify one point and own another indefensible; it is more honest to confess at once how little I am touched by the desire of accuracy.</s> <s>This is no furniture for the scholar's library, but a book for the winter evening school-room when the tasks are over and the hour for bed draws near; and honest Alan, who was a grim old fire-eater in his day has in this new avatar no more desperate purpose than to steal some young gentleman's attention from his Ovid, carry him awhile into the Highlands and the last century, and pack him to bed with some engaging images to mingle with his dreams.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c0.p15"><s>As for you, my dear Charles, I do not even ask you to like this tale.</s> <s>But perhaps when he is older, your son will; he may then be pleased to find his father's name on the fly-leaf; and in the meanwhile it pleases me to set it there, in memory of many days that were happy and some (now perhaps as pleasant to remember) that were sad.</s> <s>If it is strange for me to look back from a distance both in time and space on these bygone adventures of our youth, it must be stranger for you who tread the same streets--who may to-morrow open the door of the old Speculative, where we begin to rank with Scott and Robert Emmet and the beloved and inglorious Macbean--or may pass the corner of the close where that great society, the L. J.</s> <s>R., held its meetings and drank its beer, sitting in the seats of Burns and his companions.</s> <s>I think I see you, moving there by plain daylight, beholding with your natural eyes those places that have now become for your companion a part of the scenery of dreams.</s> <s>How, in the intervals of present business, the past must echo in your memory!</s> <s>Let it not echo often without some kind thoughts of your friend,</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I. I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS</title>
<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c1.s1">I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out of the door of my father's house.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c1.s2">The sun began to shine upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="kidnap.c1.s3">Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the garden gate, good man!</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c1.s4">He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="kidnap.c1.s5">"Well, Davie, lad," said he, "I will go with you as far as the ford, to set you on the way."</s> <s sid="6" id="kidnap.c1.s6">And we began to walk forward in silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c1.p4"><s sid="7" id="kidnap.c1.s7">"Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?" said he, after awhile.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c1.p5"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c1.s8">"Why, sir," said I, "if I knew where I was going, or what was likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c1.s9">Essendean is a good place indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been anywhere else.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c1.s10">My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was going I would go with a good will."</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="kidnap.c1.s11">"Ay?" said Mr. Campbell.</s> <s sid="12" id="kidnap.c1.s12">"Very well, Davie.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c1.s13">Then it behoves me to tell your fortune; or so far as I may.</s> <s sid="14" id="kidnap.c1.s14">When your mother was gone, and your father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance.</s> <s sid="15" id="kidnap.c1.s15"><qs/>'So soon,'<qe/><sls/> says he, 'as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear disposed of' (all which, Davie, hath been done), <sle/><qs/>'give my boy this letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far from Cramond.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c1.s16">That is the place I came from,'<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>'and it's where it befits that my boy should return.</s> <s sid="17" id="kidnap.c1.s17">He is a steady lad,'<qe/> your father said, 'and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well lived where he goes.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="kidnap.c1.s18">"The house of Shaws!"</s> <s sid="19" id="kidnap.c1.s19">I cried.</s> <s sid="20" id="kidnap.c1.s20">"What had my poor father to do with the house of Shaws?"</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c1.p8"><s sid="21" id="kidnap.c1.s21">"Nay," said Mr. Campbell, "who can tell that for a surety?</s> <s sid="22" id="kidnap.c1.s22">But the name of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws: an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter days decayed.</s> <s sid="23" id="kidnap.c1.s23">Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society.</s> <s sid="24" id="kidnap.c1.s24">Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed brother."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c1.p9"><s sid="25" id="kidnap.c1.s25">He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words:</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c1.s26">"To the hands of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will be delivered by my son, David Balfour."</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c1.s27">My heart was beating hard at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c1.p10"><s sid="28" id="kidnap.c1.s28">"Mr. Campbell," I stammered, "and if you were in my shoes, would you go?"</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c1.p11"><s sid="29" id="kidnap.c1.s29">"Of a surety," said the minister, "that would I, and without pause.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c1.s30">A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by Edinburgh) in two days of walk.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c1.s31">If the worst came to the worst, and your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back again and risp at the manse door.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c1.s32">But I would rather hope that ye shall be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything that I ken come to be a great man in time.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c1.s33">And here, Davie, laddie," he resumed, "it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c1.p12"><s sid="34" id="kidnap.c1.s34">Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long, serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks, put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him.</s> <s sid="35" id="kidnap.c1.s35">There, then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible.</s> <s sid="36" id="kidnap.c1.s36">That done, he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I should conduct myself with its inhabitants.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c1.p13"><s sid="37" id="kidnap.c1.s37">"Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial," said he.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c1.s38">"Bear ye this in mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c1.s39">Dinnae shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us!</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c1.s40">In yon great, muckle house, with all these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect, as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any.</s> <s sid="41" id="kidnap.c1.s41">As for the laird--remember he's the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour.</s> <s sid="42" id="kidnap.c1.s42">It's a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c1.p14"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c1.s43">"Well, sir," said I, "it may be; and I'll promise you I'll try to make it so."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c1.p15"><s sid="44" id="kidnap.c1.s44">"Why, very well said," replied Mr. Campbell, heartily.</s> <s sid="45" id="kidnap.c1.s45">"And now to come to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial.</s> <s sid="46" id="kidnap.c1.s46">I have here a little packet which contains four things."</s> <s sid="47" id="kidnap.c1.s47">He tugged it, as he spoke, and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat.</s> <s sid="48" id="kidnap.c1.s48">"Of these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money for your father's books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to the incoming dominie.</s> <s sid="49" id="kidnap.c1.s49">The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and myself would be blithe of your acceptance.</s> <s sid="50" id="kidnap.c1.s50">The first, which is round, will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie, it's but a drop of water in the sea; it'll help you but a step, and vanish like the morning.</s> <s sid="51" id="kidnap.c1.s51">The second, which is flat and square and written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness.</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c1.s52">And as for the last, which is cubical, that'll see you, it's my prayerful wish, into a better land."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c1.p16"><s sid="53" id="kidnap.c1.s53">With that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard; then held me at arm's length, looking at me with his face all working with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run.</s> <s sid="54" id="kidnap.c1.s54">It might have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh.</s> <s sid="55" id="kidnap.c1.s55">I watched him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once looked back.</s> <s sid="56" id="kidnap.c1.s56">Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I, for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side, and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my own name and blood.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c1.p17"><s sid="57" id="kidnap.c1.s57">"Davie, Davie," I thought, "was ever seen such black ingratitude?</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c1.s58">Can you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name?</s> <s sid="59" id="kidnap.c1.s59">Fie, fie; think shame."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c1.p18"><s sid="60" id="kidnap.c1.s60">And I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the parcel to see the nature of my gifts.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c1.s61">That which he had called cubical, I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to carry in a plaid-neuk.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c1.s62">That which he had called round, I found to be a shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c1.p19"><s sid="63" id="kidnap.c1.s63">"TO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is occasion.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c1.s64">It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c1.s65">It is good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory; and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well, and whether man or woman."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c1.p20"><s sid="66" id="kidnap.c1.s66">And then, in the minister's own hand, was added:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c1.p21"><s sid="67" id="kidnap.c1.s67">"Likewise for sprains, rub it in; and for the cholic, a great spooneful in the hour."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c1.p22"><s sid="68" id="kidnap.c1.s68">To be sure, I laughed over this; but it was rather tremulous laughter; and I was glad to get my bundle on my staff's end and set out over the ford and up the hill upon the farther side; till, just as I came on the green drove-road running wide through the heather, I took my last look of Kirk Essendean, the trees about the manse, and the big rowans in the kirkyard where my father and my mother lay.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c2.s1">On the forenoon of the second day, coming to the top of a hill, I saw all the country fall away before me down to the sea; and in the midst of this descent, on a long ridge, the city of Edinburgh smoking like a kiln.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c2.s2">There was a flag upon the castle, and ships moving or lying anchored in the firth; both of which, for as far away as they were, I could distinguish clearly; and both brought my country heart into my mouth.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="kidnap.c2.s3">Presently after, I came by a house where a shepherd lived, and got a rough direction for the neighbourhood of Cramond; and so, from one to another, worked my way to the westward of the capital by Colinton, till I came out upon the Glasgow road.</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c2.s4">And there, to my great pleasure and wonder, I beheld a regiment marching to the fifes, every foot in time; an old red-faced general on a grey horse at the one end, and at the other the company of Grenadiers, with their Pope's-hats.</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c2.s5">The pride of life seemed to mount into my brain at the sight of the red coats and the hearing of that merry music.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c4.p35"><s sid="92" id="kidnap.c4.s92">The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights.</s> <s sid="93" id="kidnap.c4.s93">Well, I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward as usual, my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness beyond it.</s> <s sid="94" id="kidnap.c4.s94">The stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death; and (although, thanks to the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe enough) the mere thought of the peril in which I might have stood, and the dreadful height I might have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon my body and relaxed my joints.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c4.p41"><s sid="113" id="kidnap.c4.s113">He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed to have ceased breathing.</s> <s sid="114" id="kidnap.c4.s114">Fear came on me that he was dead; then I got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids.</s> <s sid="115" id="kidnap.c4.s115">At last he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was not of this world.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c9.p10"><s sid="24" id="kidnap.c9.s24">"I'm vexed, sir, about the boat," says the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c9.p30"><s sid="69" id="kidnap.c9.s69">"Little enough, to be sure," said Hoseason; and then, "if they knew," he added, drily.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c9.s70">"But I think, if I was to try, that I could hold my tongue about it."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c12.p2"><s sid="3" id="kidnap.c12.s3">And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map.</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c12.s4">On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan's boat, we had been running through the Little Minch.</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c12.s5">At dawn after the battle, we lay becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle Eriska in the chain of the Long Island.</s> <s sid="6" id="kidnap.c12.s6">Now to get from there to the Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of Mull.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c12.s7">But the captain had no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so deep among the islands; and the wind serving well, he preferred to go by west of Tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great Isle of Mull.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c12.p3"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c12.s8">All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than died down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the outer Hebrides.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c12.s9">Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to the west of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and were much rolled about.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c12.s10">But after nightfall, when we had turned the end of Tiree and began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c12.p4"><s sid="11" id="kidnap.c12.s11">Meanwhile, the early part of the day, before the swell came up, was very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright sunshine and with many mountainous islands upon different sides.</s> <s sid="12" id="kidnap.c12.s12">Alan and I sat in the round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain's fine tobacco.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c12.s13">It was at this time we heard each other's stories, which was the more important to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which I was so soon to land.</s> <s sid="14" id="kidnap.c12.s14">In those days, so close on the back of the great rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c12.p9"><s sid="22" id="kidnap.c12.s22">"Well," says he, "ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got lands of us by treachery--but never with the sword," he cried loudly, and with the word brought down his fist upon the table.</s> <s sid="23" id="kidnap.c12.s23">But I paid the less attention to this, for I knew it was usually said by those who have the underhand.</s> <s sid="24" id="kidnap.c12.s24">"There's more than that," he continued, "and all in the same story: lying words, lying papers, tricks fit for a peddler, and the show of what's legal over all, to make a man the more angry."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c12.p12"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c12.s36">"I think he was not the man to leave you rich," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c12.p14"><s sid="40" id="kidnap.c12.s40">"What," cried I, "were you in the English army?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c12.p17"><s sid="46" id="kidnap.c12.s46">"Ay" said he, "if they got hands on me, it would be a short shrift and a lang tow for Alan!</s> <s sid="47" id="kidnap.c12.s47">But I have the King of France's commission in my pocket, which would aye be some protection."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c12.p24"><s sid="59" id="kidnap.c12.s59">"I thought they called your chief Appin," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c12.p25"><s sid="60" id="kidnap.c12.s60">"Ay, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan," said he, which scarcely cleared my mind.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c12.s61">"Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought down to live in a French town like a poor and private person.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c12.s62">He that had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a kale-leaf.</s> <s sid="63" id="kidnap.c12.s63">This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c12.s64">There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in that far country.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c12.s65">Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel.</s> <s sid="66" id="kidnap.c12.s66">Well, David, I'm the hand that carries it."</s> <s sid="67" id="kidnap.c12.s67">And he struck the belt about his body, so that the guineas rang.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c13.p6"><s sid="7" id="kidnap.c13.s7">The sky was clear; it blew hard, and was bitter cold; a great deal of daylight lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c13.s8">The brig was close hauled, so as to round the southwest corner of the Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c13.s9">Though it was no good point of sailing for the Covenant, she tore through the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the westerly swell.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c13.p8"><s sid="12" id="kidnap.c13.s12">"What do ye call that?" asked the captain, gloomily.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c13.p19"><s sid="28" id="kidnap.c13.s28">"So?" said Hoseason.</s> <s sid="29" id="kidnap.c13.s29">"We'll have to haul our wind then, Mr. Riach; we'll have to come as near in about the end of Mull as we can take her, sir; and even then we'll have the land to kep the wind off us, and that stoneyard on our lee.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c13.s30">Well, we're in for it now, and may as well crack on."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c13.p20"><s sid="31" id="kidnap.c13.s31">With that he gave an order to the steersman, and sent Riach to the foretop.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c13.s32">There were only five men on deck, counting the officers; these being all that were fit (or, at least, both fit and willing) for their work.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c13.s33">So, as I say, it fell to Mr. Riach to go aloft, and he sat there looking out and hailing the deck with news of all he saw.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c13.p21"><s sid="34" id="kidnap.c13.s34">"The sea to the south is thick," he cried; and then, after a while, "it does seem clearer in by the land."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c13.p24"><s sid="41" id="kidnap.c13.s41">As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to change the course.</s> <s sid="42" id="kidnap.c13.s42">Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was so close on the brig's weather board that when a sea burst upon it the lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c13.p25"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c13.s43">The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day, which was, perhaps, the more alarming.</s> <s sid="44" id="kidnap.c13.s44">It showed me, too, the face of the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and looking and as steady as steel.</s> <s sid="45" id="kidnap.c13.s45">Neither he nor Mr. Riach had shown well in the fighting; but I saw they were brave in their own trade, and admired them all the more because I found Alan very white.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c13.p26"><s sid="46" id="kidnap.c13.s46">"Ochone, David," says he, "this is no the kind of death I fancy!"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c13.p29"><s sid="50" id="kidnap.c13.s50">By this time, now and then sheering to one side or the other to avoid a reef, but still hugging the wind and the land, we had got round Iona and begun to come alongside Mull.</s> <s sid="51" id="kidnap.c13.s51">The tide at the tail of the land ran very strong, and threw the brig about.</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c13.s52">Two hands were put to the helm, and Hoseason himself would sometimes lend a help; and it was strange to see three strong men throw their weight upon the tiller, and it (like a living thing) struggle against and drive them back.</s> <s sid="53" id="kidnap.c13.s53">This would have been the greater danger had not the sea been for some while free of obstacles.</s> <s sid="54" id="kidnap.c13.s54">Mr. Riach, besides, announced from the top that he saw clear water ahead.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c13.p30"><s sid="55" id="kidnap.c13.s55">"Ye were right," said Hoseason to Alan.</s> <s sid="56" id="kidnap.c13.s56">"Ye have saved the brig, sir.</s> <s sid="57" id="kidnap.c13.s57">I'll mind that when we come to clear accounts."</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c13.s58">And I believe he not only meant what he said, but would have done it; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c13.p31"><s sid="59" id="kidnap.c13.s59">But this is matter only for conjecture, things having gone otherwise than he forecast.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c13.p32"><s sid="60" id="kidnap.c13.s60">"Keep her away a point," sings out Mr. Riach.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c13.s61">"Reef to windward!"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c13.p33"><s sid="62" id="kidnap.c13.s62">And just at the same time the tide caught the brig, and threw the wind out of her sails.</s> <s sid="63" id="kidnap.c13.s63">She came round into the wind like a top, and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck, and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c13.p34"><s sid="64" id="kidnap.c13.s64">I was on my feet in a minute.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c13.s65">The reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull, off a little isle they call Earraid, which lay low and black upon the larboard.</s> <s sid="66" id="kidnap.c13.s66">Sometimes the swell broke clean over us; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef, so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces; and what with the great noise of the sails, and the singing of the wind, and the flying of the spray in the moonlight, and the sense of danger, I think my head must have been partly turned, for I could scarcely understand the things I saw.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c13.p35"><s sid="67" id="kidnap.c13.s67">Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff, and, still in the same blank, ran over to assist them; and as soon as I set my hand to work, my mind came clear again.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c13.s68">It was no very easy task, for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper, and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on; but we all wrought like horses while we could.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c13.p36"><s sid="69" id="kidnap.c13.s69">Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c13.p37"><s sid="70" id="kidnap.c13.s70">The captain took no part.</s> <s sid="71" id="kidnap.c13.s71">It seemed he was struck stupid.</s> <s sid="72" id="kidnap.c13.s72">He stood holding by the shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock.</s> <s sid="73" id="kidnap.c13.s73">His brig was like wife and child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of poor Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c13.p38"><s sid="74" id="kidnap.c13.s74">All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other thing: that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it was; and he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a land of the Campbells.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c13.p39"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c13.s75">We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us warning.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c13.s76">Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when this man sang out pretty shrill:</s> <s sid="77" id="kidnap.c13.s77">"For God's sake, hold on!"</s> <s sid="78" id="kidnap.c13.s78">We knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough, there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her over on her beam.</s> <s sid="79" id="kidnap.c13.s79">Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c13.p40"><s sid="80" id="kidnap.c13.s80">I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the moon, and then down again.</s> <s sid="81" id="kidnap.c13.s81">They say a man sinks a third time for good.</s> <s sid="82" id="kidnap.c13.s82">I cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how often I went down, or how often I came up again.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c13.s83">All the while, I was being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed whole; and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither sorry nor afraid.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c13.p41"><s sid="84" id="kidnap.c13.s84">Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat.</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c13.s85">And then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c13.p42"><s sid="86" id="kidnap.c13.s86">It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far I had travelled from the brig.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c13.s87">I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain she was already out of cry.</s> <s sid="88" id="kidnap.c13.s88">She was still holding together; but whether or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low down to see.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c13.p43"><s sid="89" id="kidnap.c13.s89">While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between us where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles.</s> <s sid="90" id="kidnap.c13.s90">Sometimes the whole tract swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again.</s> <s sid="91" id="kidnap.c13.s91">What it was I had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that play, had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="kidnap.c13.p44"><s sid="92" id="kidnap.c13.s92">I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold as well as of drowning.</s> <s sid="93" id="kidnap.c13.s93">The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the rocks.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c14.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c14.s1">With my stepping ashore I began the most unhappy part of my adventures.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c14.s2">It was half-past twelve in the morning, and though the wind was broken by the land, it was a cold night.</s> <s sid="3" id="kidnap.c14.s3">I dared not sit down (for I thought I should have frozen), but took off my shoes and walked to and fro upon the sand, bare-foot, and beating my breast with infinite weariness.</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c14.s4">There was no sound of man or cattle; not a cock crew, though it was about the hour of their first waking; only the surf broke outside in the distance, which put me in mind of my perils and those of my friend.</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c14.s5">To walk by the sea at that hour of the morning, and in a place so desert-like and lonesome, struck me with a kind of fear.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c14.p2"><s sid="6" id="kidnap.c14.s6">As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a hill--the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook--falling, the whole way, between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c14.s7">When I got to the top the dawn was come.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c14.s8">There was no sign of the brig, which must have lifted from the reef and sunk.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c14.s9">The boat, too, was nowhere to be seen.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c14.s10">There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c14.p3"><s sid="11" id="kidnap.c14.s11">I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene.</s> <s sid="12" id="kidnap.c14.s12">What with my wet clothes and weariness, and my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble me without that.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c14.s13">So I set off eastward along the south coast, hoping to find a house where I might warm myself, and perhaps get news of those I had lost.</s> <s sid="14" id="kidnap.c14.s14">And at the worst, I considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c14.p4"><s sid="15" id="kidnap.c14.s15">After a little, my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea, which seemed to run pretty deep into the land; and as I had no means to get across, I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c14.s16">It was still the roughest kind of walking; indeed the whole, not only of Earraid, but of the neighbouring part of Mull (which they call the Ross) is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among.</s> <s sid="17" id="kidnap.c14.s17">At first the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see; but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again.</s> <s sid="18" id="kidnap.c14.s18">At this I scratched my head, but had still no notion of the truth: until at last I came to a rising ground, and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a little barren isle, and cut off on every side by the salt seas.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c14.p5"><s sid="19" id="kidnap.c14.s19">Instead of the sun rising to dry me, it came on to rain, with a thick mist; so that my case was lamentable.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c14.p6"><s sid="20" id="kidnap.c14.s20">I stood in the rain, and shivered, and wondered what to do, till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable.</s> <s sid="21" id="kidnap.c14.s21">Back I went to the narrowest point and waded in.</s> <s sid="22" id="kidnap.c14.s22">But not three yards from shore, I plumped in head over ears; and if ever I was heard of more, it was rather by God's grace than my own prudence.</s> <s sid="23" id="kidnap.c14.s23">I was no wetter (for that could hardly be), but I was all the colder for this mishap; and having lost another hope was the more unhappy.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c14.p7"><s sid="24" id="kidnap.c14.s24">And now, all at once, the yard came in my head.</s> <s sid="25" id="kidnap.c14.s25">What had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety.</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c14.s26">With that I set off, undaunted, across the top of the isle, to fetch and carry it back.</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c14.s27">It was a weary tramp in all ways, and if hope had not buoyed me up, I must have cast myself down and given up.</s> <s sid="28" id="kidnap.c14.s28">Whether with the sea salt, or because I was growing fevered, I was distressed with thirst, and had to stop, as I went, and drink the peaty water out of the hags.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c14.p8"><s sid="29" id="kidnap.c14.s29">I came to the bay at last, more dead than alive; and at the first glance, I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left it.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c14.s30">In I went, for the third time, into the sea.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c14.s31">The sand was smooth and firm, and shelved gradually down, so that I could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c14.s32">But at that depth my feet began to leave me, and I durst venture in no farther.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c14.s33">As for the yard, I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c14.p9"><s sid="34" id="kidnap.c14.s34">I had borne up well until this last disappointment; but at that I came ashore, and flung myself down upon the sands and wept.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c14.p10"><s sid="35" id="kidnap.c14.s35">The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me, that I must pass it lightly over.</s> <s sid="36" id="kidnap.c14.s36">In all the books I have read of people cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c14.s37">My case was very different.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c14.s38">I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan's silver button; and being inland bred, I was as much short of knowledge as of means.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c14.p11"><s sid="39" id="kidnap.c14.s39">I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets, which at first I could scarcely strike from their places, not knowing quickness to be needful.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c14.s40">There were, besides, some of the little shells that we call buckies; I think periwinkle is the English name.</s> <s sid="41" id="kidnap.c14.s41">Of these two I made my whole diet, devouring them cold and raw as I found them; and so hungry was I, that at first they seemed to me delicious.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c14.p12"><s sid="42" id="kidnap.c14.s42">Perhaps they were out of season, or perhaps there was something wrong in the sea about my island.</s> <s sid="43" id="kidnap.c14.s43">But at least I had no sooner eaten my first meal than I was seized with giddiness and retching, and lay for a long time no better than dead.</s> <s sid="44" id="kidnap.c14.s44">A second trial of the same food (indeed I had no other) did better with me, and revived my strength.</s> <s sid="45" id="kidnap.c14.s45">But as long as I was on the island, I never knew what to expect when I had eaten; sometimes all was well, and sometimes I was thrown into a miserable sickness; nor could I ever distinguish what particular fish it was that hurt me.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c14.p13"><s sid="46" id="kidnap.c14.s46">All day it streamed rain; the island ran like a sop, there was no dry spot to be found; and when I lay down that night, between two boulders that made a kind of roof, my feet were in a bog.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c14.p14"><s sid="47" id="kidnap.c14.s47">The second day I crossed the island to all sides.</s> <s sid="48" id="kidnap.c14.s48">There was no one part of it better than another; it was all desolate and rocky; nothing living on it but game birds which I lacked the means to kill, and the gulls which haunted the outlying rocks in a prodigious number.</s> <s sid="49" id="kidnap.c14.s49">But the creek, or strait, that cut off the isle from the main-land of the Ross, opened out on the north into a bay, and the bay again opened into the Sound of Iona; and it was the neighbourhood of this place that I chose to be my home; though if I had thought upon the very name of home in such a spot, I must have burst out weeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c14.p15"><s sid="50" id="kidnap.c14.s50">I had good reasons for my choice.</s> <s sid="51" id="kidnap.c14.s51">There was in this part of the isle a little hut of a house like a pig's hut, where fishers used to sleep when they came there upon their business; but the turf roof of it had fallen entirely in; so that the hut was of no use to me, and gave me less shelter than my rocks.</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c14.s52">What was more important, the shell-fish on which I lived grew there in great plenty; when the tide was out I could gather a peck at a time: and this was doubtless a convenience.</s> <s sid="53" id="kidnap.c14.s53">But the other reason went deeper.</s> <s sid="54" id="kidnap.c14.s54">I had become in no way used to the horrid solitude of the isle, but still looked round me on all sides (like a man that was hunted), between fear and hope that I might see some human creature coming.</s> <s sid="55" id="kidnap.c14.s55">Now, from a little up the hillside over the bay, I could catch a sight of the great, ancient church and the roofs of the people's houses in Iona.</s> <s sid="56" id="kidnap.c14.s56">And on the other hand, over the low country of the Ross, I saw smoke go up, morning and evening, as if from a homestead in a hollow of the land.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c14.p16"><s sid="57" id="kidnap.c14.s57">I used to watch this smoke, when I was wet and cold, and had my head half turned with loneliness; and think of the fireside and the company, till my heart burned.</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c14.s58">It was the same with the roofs of Iona.</s> <s sid="59" id="kidnap.c14.s59">Altogether, this sight I had of men's homes and comfortable lives, although it put a point on my own sufferings, yet it kept hope alive, and helped me to eat my raw shell-fish (which had soon grown to be a disgust), and saved me from the sense of horror I had whenever I was quite alone with dead rocks, and fowls, and the rain, and the cold sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c14.p17"><s sid="60" id="kidnap.c14.s60">I say it kept hope alive; and indeed it seemed impossible that I should be left to die on the shores of my own country, and within view of a church-tower and the smoke of men's houses.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c14.s61">But the second day passed; and though as long as the light lasted I kept a bright look-out for boats on the Sound or men passing on the Ross, no help came near me.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c14.s62">It still rained, and I turned in to sleep, as wet as ever, and with a cruel sore throat, but a little comforted, perhaps, by having said good-night to my next neighbours, the people of Iona.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c14.p18"><s sid="63" id="kidnap.c14.s63">Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the year in the climate of England than in any other.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c14.s64">This was very like a king, with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c14.s65">But he must have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that miserable isle.</s> <s sid="66" id="kidnap.c14.s66">It was the height of the summer; yet it rained for more than twenty-four hours, and did not clear until the afternoon of the third day.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c14.p19"><s sid="67" id="kidnap.c14.s67">This was the day of incidents.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c14.s68">In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before he trotted off upon the other side.</s> <s sid="69" id="kidnap.c14.s69">I supposed he must have swum the strait; though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than I could fancy.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c14.p20"><s sid="70" id="kidnap.c14.s70">A little after, as I was jumping about after my limpets, I was startled by a guinea-piece, which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off into the sea.</s> <s sid="71" id="kidnap.c14.s71">When the sailors gave me my money again, they kept back not only about a third of the whole sum, but my father's leather purse; so that from that day out, I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a button.</s> <s sid="72" id="kidnap.c14.s72">I now saw there must be a hole, and clapped my hand to the place in a great hurry.</s> <s sid="73" id="kidnap.c14.s73">But this was to lock the stable door after the steed was stolen.</s> <s sid="74" id="kidnap.c14.s74">I had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty pounds; now I found no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver shilling.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c14.p21"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c14.s75">It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after, where it lay shining on a piece of turf.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c14.s76">That made a fortune of three pounds and four shillings, English money, for a lad, the rightful heir of an estate, and now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c14.p22"><s sid="77" id="kidnap.c14.s77">This state of my affairs dashed me still further; and, indeed my plight on that third morning was truly pitiful.</s> <s sid="78" id="kidnap.c14.s78">My clothes were beginning to rot; my stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my shanks went naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual soaking; my throat was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my heart so turned against the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that the very sight of it came near to sicken me.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c14.p23"><s sid="79" id="kidnap.c14.s79">And yet the worst was not yet come.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c14.p24"><s sid="80" id="kidnap.c14.s80">There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid, which (because it had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was much in the habit of frequenting; not that ever I stayed in one place, save when asleep, my misery giving me no rest.</s> <s sid="81" id="kidnap.c14.s81">Indeed, I wore myself down with continual and aimless goings and comings in the rain.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c14.p25"><s sid="82" id="kidnap.c14.s82">As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top of that rock to dry myself.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c14.s83">The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I cannot tell.</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c14.s84">It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had begun to despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh interest.</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c14.s85">On the south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and hid the open ocean, so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon that side, and I be none the wiser.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c14.p26"><s sid="86" id="kidnap.c14.s86">Well, all of a sudden, a coble with a brown sail and a pair of fishers aboard of it, came flying round that corner of the isle, bound for Iona.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c14.s87">I shouted out, and then fell on my knees on the rock and reached up my hands and prayed to them.</s> <s sid="88" id="kidnap.c14.s88">They were near enough to hear--I could even see the colour of their hair; and there was no doubt but they observed me, for they cried out in the Gaelic tongue, and laughed.</s> <s sid="89" id="kidnap.c14.s89">But the boat never turned aside, and flew on, right before my eyes, for Iona.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c14.p27"><s sid="90" id="kidnap.c14.s90">I could not believe such wickedness, and ran along the shore from rock to rock, crying on them piteously even after they were out of reach of my voice, I still cried and waved to them; and when they were quite gone, I thought my heart would have burst.</s> <s sid="91" id="kidnap.c14.s91">All the time of my troubles I wept only twice.</s> <s sid="92" id="kidnap.c14.s92">Once, when I could not reach the yard, and now, the second time, when these fishers turned a deaf ear to my cries.</s> <s sid="93" id="kidnap.c14.s93">But this time I wept and roared like a wicked child, tearing up the turf with my nails, and grinding my face in the earth.</s> <s sid="94" id="kidnap.c14.s94">If a wish would kill men, those two fishers would never have seen morning, and I should likely have died upon my island.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c14.p28"><s sid="95" id="kidnap.c14.s95">When I was a little over my anger, I must eat again, but with such loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control.</s> <s sid="96" id="kidnap.c14.s96">Sure enough, I should have done as well to fast, for my fishes poisoned me again.</s> <s sid="97" id="kidnap.c14.s97">I had all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there came on me that dreadful sense of illness, which we have no name for either in Scotch or English.</s> <s sid="98" id="kidnap.c14.s98">I thought I should have died, and made my peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; and as soon as I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me; I observed the night was falling dry; my clothes were dried a good deal; truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on the isle; and so I got to sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c14.p29"><s sid="99" id="kidnap.c14.s99">The next day (which was the fourth of this horrible life of mine) I found my bodily strength run very low.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c14.s100">But the sun shone, the air was sweet, and what I managed to eat of the shell-fish agreed well with me and revived my courage.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c14.p30"><s sid="101" id="kidnap.c14.s101">I was scarce back on my rock (where I went always the first thing after I had eaten) before I observed a boat coming down the Sound, and with her head, as I thought, in my direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c14.p31"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c14.s102">I began at once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought these men might have thought better of their cruelty and be coming back to my assistance.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c14.s103">But another disappointment, such as yesterday's, was more than I could bear.</s> <s sid="104" id="kidnap.c14.s104">I turned my back, accordingly, upon the sea, and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds.</s> <s sid="105" id="kidnap.c14.s105">The boat was still heading for the island.</s> <s sid="106" id="kidnap.c14.s106">The next time I counted the full thousand, as slowly as I could, my heart beating so as to hurt me.</s> <s sid="107" id="kidnap.c14.s107">And then it was out of all question.</s> <s sid="108" id="kidnap.c14.s108">She was coming straight to Earraid!</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c14.p32"><s sid="109" id="kidnap.c14.s109">I could no longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out, from one rock to another, as far as I could go.</s> <s sid="110" id="kidnap.c14.s110">It is a marvel I was not drowned; for when I was brought to a stand at last, my legs shook under me, and my mouth was so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c14.p33"><s sid="111" id="kidnap.c14.s111">All this time the boat was coming on; and now I was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday.</s> <s sid="112" id="kidnap.c14.s112">This I knew by their hair, which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black.</s> <s sid="113" id="kidnap.c14.s113">But now there was a third man along with them, who looked to be of a better class.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c14.p34"><s sid="114" id="kidnap.c14.s114">As soon as they were come within easy speech, they let down their sail and lay quiet.</s> <s sid="115" id="kidnap.c14.s115">In spite of my supplications, they drew no nearer in, and what frightened me most of all, the new man tee-hee'd with laughter as he talked and looked at me.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c14.p35"><s sid="116" id="kidnap.c14.s116">Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while, speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand.</s> <s sid="117" id="kidnap.c14.s117">I told him I had no Gaelic; and at this he became very angry, and I began to suspect he thought he was talking English.</s> <s sid="118" id="kidnap.c14.s118">Listening very close, I caught the word "whateffer" several times; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c14.p36"><s sid="119" id="kidnap.c14.s119">"Whatever," said I, to show him I had caught a word.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c14.p37"><s sid="120" id="kidnap.c14.s120">"Yes, yes--yes, yes," says he, and then he looked at the other men, as much as to say, "I told you I spoke English," and began again as hard as ever in the Gaelic.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c14.p38"><s sid="121" id="kidnap.c14.s121">This time I picked out another word, "tide."</s> <s sid="122" id="kidnap.c14.s122">Then I had a flash of hope.</s> <s sid="123" id="kidnap.c14.s123">I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the Ross.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c14.p39"><s sid="124" id="kidnap.c14.s124">"Do you mean when the tide is out--?"</s> <s sid="125" id="kidnap.c14.s125">I cried, and could not finish.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c14.p40"><s sid="126" id="kidnap.c14.s126">"Yes, yes," said he.</s> <s sid="127" id="kidnap.c14.s127">"Tide."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c14.p41"><s sid="128" id="kidnap.c14.s128">At that I turned tail upon their boat (where my adviser had once more begun to tee-hee with laughter), leaped back the way I had come, from one stone to another, and set off running across the isle as I had never run before.</s> <s sid="129" id="kidnap.c14.s129">In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the creek; and, sure enough, it was shrunk into a little trickle of water, through which I dashed, not above my knees, and landed with a shout on the main island.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c14.p42"><s sid="130" id="kidnap.c14.s130">A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod, or at the most by wading.</s> <s sid="131" id="kidnap.c14.s131">Even I, who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get my shellfish--even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free.</s> <s sid="132" id="kidnap.c14.s132">It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me.</s> <s sid="133" id="kidnap.c14.s133">The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion, and taken the trouble to come back.</s> <s sid="134" id="kidnap.c14.s134">I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours.</s> <s sid="135" id="kidnap.c14.s135">But for the fishers, I might have left my bones there, in pure folly.</s> <s sid="136" id="kidnap.c14.s136">And even as it was, I had paid for it pretty dear, not only in past sufferings, but in my present case; being clothed like a beggar-man, scarce able to walk, and in great pain of my sore throat.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XV. THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: THROUGH THE ISLE OF MULL</title>
<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c15.s1">The Ross of Mull, which I had now got upon, was rugged and trackless, like the isle I had just left; being all bog, and brier, and big stone.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c15.s2">There may be roads for them that know that country well; but for my part I had no better guide than my own nose, and no other landmark than Ben More.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c15.p2"><s sid="3" id="kidnap.c15.s3">I aimed as well as I could for the smoke I had seen so often from the island; and with all my great weariness and the difficulty of the way came upon the house in the bottom of a little hollow about five or six at night.</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c15.s4">It was low and longish, roofed with turf and built of unmortared stones; and on a mound in front of it, an old gentleman sat smoking his pipe in the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c15.p3"><s sid="5" id="kidnap.c15.s5">With what little English he had, he gave me to understand that my shipmates had got safe ashore, and had broken bread in that very house on the day after.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c15.p4"><s sid="6" id="kidnap.c15.s6">"Was there one," I asked, "dressed like a gentleman?"</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c15.p5"><s sid="7" id="kidnap.c15.s7">He said they all wore rough great-coats; but to be sure, the first of them, the one that came alone, wore breeches and stockings, while the rest had sailors' trousers.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c15.p6"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c15.s8">"Ah," said I, "and he would have a feathered hat?"</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c15.p7"><s sid="9" id="kidnap.c15.s9">He told me, no, that he was bareheaded like myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c15.p8"><s sid="10" id="kidnap.c15.s10">At first I thought Alan might have lost his hat; and then the rain came in my mind, and I judged it more likely he had it out of harm's way under his great-coat.</s> <s sid="11" id="kidnap.c15.s11">This set me smiling, partly because my friend was safe, partly to think of his vanity in dress.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c15.p9"><s sid="12" id="kidnap.c15.s12">And then the old gentleman clapped his hand to his brow, and cried out that I must be the lad with the silver button.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c15.p10"><s sid="13" id="kidnap.c15.s13">"Why, yes!" said I, in some wonder.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c15.p11"><s sid="14" id="kidnap.c15.s14">"Well, then," said the old gentleman, "I have a word for you, that you are to follow your friend to his country, by Torosay."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c15.p12"><s sid="15" id="kidnap.c15.s15">He then asked me how I had fared, and I told him my tale.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c15.s16">A south-country man would certainly have laughed; but this old gentleman (I call him so because of his manners, for his clothes were dropping off his back) heard me all through with nothing but gravity and pity.</s> <s sid="17" id="kidnap.c15.s17">When I had done, he took me by the hand, led me into his hut (it was no better) and presented me before his wife, as if she had been the Queen and I a duke.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c15.p13"><s sid="18" id="kidnap.c15.s18">The good woman set oat-bread before me and a cold grouse, patting my shoulder and smiling to me all the time, for she had no English; and the old gentleman (not to be behind) brewed me a strong punch out of their country spirit.</s> <s sid="19" id="kidnap.c15.s19">All the while I was eating, and after that when I was drinking the punch, I could scarce come to believe in my good fortune; and the house, though it was thick with the peat-smoke and as full of holes as a colander, seemed like a palace.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c15.p14"><s sid="20" id="kidnap.c15.s20">The punch threw me in a strong sweat and a deep slumber; the good people let me lie; and it was near noon of the next day before I took the road, my throat already easier and my spirits quite restored by good fare and good news.</s> <s sid="21" id="kidnap.c15.s21">The old gentleman, although I pressed him hard, would take no money, and gave me an old bonnet for my head; though I am free to own I was no sooner out of view of the house than I very jealously washed this gift of his in a wayside fountain.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c15.p15"><s sid="22" id="kidnap.c15.s22">Thought I to myself:</s> <s sid="23" id="kidnap.c15.s23">"If these are the wild Highlanders, I could wish my own folk wilder."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c15.p16"><s sid="24" id="kidnap.c15.s24">I not only started late, but I must have wandered nearly half the time.</s> <s sid="25" id="kidnap.c15.s25">True, I met plenty of people, grubbing in little miserable fields that would not keep a cat, or herding little kine about the bigness of asses.</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c15.s26">The Highland dress being forbidden by law since the rebellion, and the people condemned to the Lowland habit, which they much disliked, it was strange to see the variety of their array.</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c15.s27">Some went bare, only for a hanging cloak or great-coat, and carried their trousers on their backs like a useless burthen: some had made an imitation of the tartan with little parti-coloured stripes patched together like an old wife's quilt; others, again, still wore the Highland philabeg, but by putting a few stitches between the legs transformed it into a pair of trousers like a Dutchman's.</s> <s sid="28" id="kidnap.c15.s28">All those makeshifts were condemned and punished, for the law was harshly applied, in hopes to break up the clan spirit; but in that out-of-the-way, sea-bound isle, there were few to make remarks and fewer to tell tales.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c15.p17"><s sid="29" id="kidnap.c15.s29">They seemed in great poverty; which was no doubt natural, now that rapine was put down, and the chiefs kept no longer an open house; and the roads (even such a wandering, country by-track as the one I followed) were infested with beggars.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c15.s30">And here again I marked a difference from my own part of the country.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c15.s31">For our Lowland beggars--even the gownsmen themselves, who beg by patent--had a louting, flattering way with them, and if you gave them a plaek and asked change, would very civilly return you a boddle.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c15.s32">But these Highland beggars stood on their dignity, asked alms only to buy snuff (by their account) and would give no change.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c15.p18"><s sid="33" id="kidnap.c15.s33">To be sure, this was no concern of mine, except in so far as it entertained me by the way.</s> <s sid="34" id="kidnap.c15.s34">What was much more to the purpose, few had any English, and these few (unless they were of the brotherhood of beggars) not very anxious to place it at my service.</s> <s sid="35" id="kidnap.c15.s35">I knew Torosay to be my destination, and repeated the name to them and pointed; but instead of simply pointing in reply, they would give me a screed of the Gaelic that set me foolish; so it was small wonder if I went out of my road as often as I stayed in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c15.p19"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c15.s36">At last, about eight at night, and already very weary, I came to a lone house, where I asked admittance, and was refused, until I bethought me of the power of money in so poor a country, and held up one of my guineas in my finger and thumb.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c15.s37">Thereupon, the man of the house, who had hitherto pretended to have no English, and driven me from his door by signals, suddenly began to speak as clearly as was needful, and agreed for five shillings to give me a night's lodging and guide me the next day to Torosay.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c15.p20"><s sid="38" id="kidnap.c15.s38">I slept uneasily that night, fearing I should be robbed; but I might have spared myself the pain; for my host was no robber, only miserably poor and a great cheat.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c15.s39">He was not alone in his poverty; for the next morning, we must go five miles about to the house of what he called a rich man to have one of my guineas changed.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c15.s40">This was perhaps a rich man for Mull; he would have scarce been thought so in the south; for it took all he had--the whole house was turned upside down, and a neighbour brought under contribution, before he could scrape together twenty shillings in silver.</s> <s sid="41" id="kidnap.c15.s41">The odd shilling he kept for himself, protesting he could ill afford to have so great a sum of money lying "locked up."</s> <s sid="42" id="kidnap.c15.s42">For all that he was very courteous and well spoken, made us both sit down with his family to dinner, and brewed punch in a fine china bowl, over which my rascal guide grew so merry that he refused to start.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c15.p21"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c15.s43">I was for getting angry, and appealed to the rich man (Hector Maclean was his name), who had been a witness to our bargain and to my payment of the five shillings.</s> <s sid="44" id="kidnap.c15.s44">But Maclean had taken his share of the punch, and vowed that no gentleman should leave his table after the bowl was brewed; so there was nothing for it but to sit and hear Jacobite toasts and Gaelic songs, till all were tipsy and staggered off to the bed or the barn for their night's rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c15.p22"><s sid="45" id="kidnap.c15.s45">Next day (the fourth of my travels) we were up before five upon the clock; but my rascal guide got to the bottle at once, and it was three hours before I had him clear of the house, and then (as you shall hear) only for a worse disappointment.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c15.p23"><s sid="46" id="kidnap.c15.s46">As long as we went down a heathery valley that lay before Mr. Maclean's house, all went well; only my guide looked constantly over his shoulder, and when I asked him the cause, only grinned at me.</s> <s sid="47" id="kidnap.c15.s47">No sooner, however, had we crossed the back of a hill, and got out of sight of the house windows, than he told me Torosay lay right in front, and that a hill-top (which he pointed out) was my best landmark.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c15.p24"><s sid="48" id="kidnap.c15.s48">"I care very little for that," said I, "since you are going with me."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c15.p25"><s sid="49" id="kidnap.c15.s49">The impudent cheat answered me in the Gaelic that he had no English.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c15.p26"><s sid="50" id="kidnap.c15.s50">"My fine fellow," I said, "I know very well your English comes and goes.</s> <s sid="51" id="kidnap.c15.s51">Tell me what will bring it back?</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c15.s52">Is it more money you wish?"</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c15.p27"><s sid="53" id="kidnap.c15.s53">"Five shillings mair," said he, "and hersel' will bring ye there."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c15.p28"><s sid="54" id="kidnap.c15.s54">I reflected awhile and then offered him two, which he accepted greedily, and insisted on having in his hands at once "for luck," as he said, but I think it was rather for my misfortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c15.p29"><s sid="55" id="kidnap.c15.s55">The two shillings carried him not quite as many miles; at the end of which distance, he sat down upon the wayside and took off his brogues from his feet, like a man about to rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c15.p30"><s sid="56" id="kidnap.c15.s56">I was now red-hot.</s> <s sid="57" id="kidnap.c15.s57">"Ha!" said I, "have you no more English?"</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c15.p31"><s sid="58" id="kidnap.c15.s58">He said impudently, "No."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c15.p32"><s sid="59" id="kidnap.c15.s59">At that I boiled over, and lifted my hand to strike him; and he, drawing a knife from his rags, squatted back and grinned at me like a wildcat.</s> <s sid="60" id="kidnap.c15.s60">At that, forgetting everything but my anger, I ran in upon him, put aside his knife with my left, and struck him in the mouth with the right.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c15.s61">I was a strong lad and very angry, and he but a little man; and he went down before me heavily.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c15.s62">By good luck, his knife flew out of his hand as he fell.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c15.p33"><s sid="63" id="kidnap.c15.s63">I picked up both that and his brogues, wished him a good morning, and set off upon my way, leaving him barefoot and disarmed.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c15.s64">I chuckled to myself as I went, being sure I was done with that rogue, for a variety of reasons.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c15.s65">First, he knew he could have no more of my money; next, the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence; and, lastly, the knife, which was really a dagger, it was against the law for him to carry.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c15.p34"><s sid="66" id="kidnap.c15.s66">In about half an hour of walk, I overtook a great, ragged man, moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff.</s> <s sid="67" id="kidnap.c15.s67">He was quite blind, and told me he was a catechist, which should have put me at my ease.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c15.s68">But his face went against me; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret; and presently, as we began to go on alongside, I saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket.</s> <s sid="69" id="kidnap.c15.s69">To carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence, and transportation to the colonies upon a second.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c15.s70">Nor could I quite see why a religious teacher should go armed, or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c15.p35"><s sid="71" id="kidnap.c15.s71">I told him about my guide, for I was proud of what I had done, and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence.</s> <s sid="72" id="kidnap.c15.s72">At the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c15.p36"><s sid="73" id="kidnap.c15.s73">"Was it too much?"</s> <s sid="74" id="kidnap.c15.s74">I asked, a little faltering.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c15.p37"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c15.s75">"Too much!" cries he.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c15.s76">"Why, I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram of brandy.</s> <s sid="77" id="kidnap.c15.s77">And give you the great pleasure of my company (me that is a man of some learning) in the bargain."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c15.p38"><s sid="78" id="kidnap.c15.s78">I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide; but at that he laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c15.p39"><s sid="79" id="kidnap.c15.s79">"In the Isle of Mull, at least," says he, "where I know every stone and heather-bush by mark of head.</s> <s sid="80" id="kidnap.c15.s80">See, now," he said, striking right and left, as if to make sure, "down there a burn is running; and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that; and it's hard at the foot of the hill, that the way runs by to Torosay; and the way here, being for droves, is plainly trodden, and will show grassy through the heather."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c15.p40"><s sid="81" id="kidnap.c15.s81">I had to own he was right in every feature, and told my wonder.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c15.p41"><s sid="82" id="kidnap.c15.s82">"Ha!" says he, "that's nothing.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c15.s83">Would ye believe me now, that before the Act came out, and when there were weepons in this country, I could shoot?</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c15.s84">Ay, could I!" cries he, and then with a leer:</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c15.s85">"If ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with, I would show ye how it's done."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c15.p42"><s sid="86" id="kidnap.c15.s86">I told him I had nothing of the sort, and gave him a wider berth.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c15.s87">If he had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket, and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt.</s> <s sid="88" id="kidnap.c15.s88">But by the better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and lied on in the dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c15.p43"><s sid="89" id="kidnap.c15.s89">He then began to question me cunningly, where I came from, whether I was rich, whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him (which he declared he had that moment in his sporran), and all the time he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him.</s> <s sid="90" id="kidnap.c15.s90">We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay, and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel.</s> <s sid="91" id="kidnap.c15.s91">I had so plainly the upper-hand that my spirits rose, and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman's buff; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier, and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="kidnap.c15.p44"><s sid="92" id="kidnap.c15.s92">Then I told him that, sure enough, I had a pistol in my pocket as well as he, and if he did not strike across the hill due south I would even blow his brains out.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="kidnap.c15.p45"><s sid="93" id="kidnap.c15.s93">He became at once very polite, and after trying to soften me for some time, but quite in vain, he cursed me once more in Gaelic and took himself off.</s> <s sid="94" id="kidnap.c15.s94">I watched him striding along, through bog and brier, tapping with his stick, until he turned the end of a hill and disappeared in the next hollow.</s> <s sid="95" id="kidnap.c15.s95">Then I struck on again for Torosay, much better pleased to be alone than to travel with that man of learning.</s> <s sid="96" id="kidnap.c15.s96">This was an unlucky day; and these two, of whom I had just rid myself, one after the other, were the two worst men I met with in the Highlands.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="kidnap.c15.p46"><s sid="97" id="kidnap.c15.s97">At Torosay, on the Sound of Mull and looking over to the mainland of Morven, there was an inn with an innkeeper, who was a Maclean, it appeared, of a very high family; for to keep an inn is thought even more genteel in the Highlands than it is with us, perhaps as partaking of hospitality, or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken.</s> <s sid="98" id="kidnap.c15.s98">He spoke good English, and finding me to be something of a scholar, tried me first in French, where he easily beat me, and then in the Latin, in which I don't know which of us did best.</s> <s sid="99" id="kidnap.c15.s99">This pleasant rivalry put us at once upon friendly terms; and I sat up and drank punch with him (or to be more correct, sat up and watched him drink it), until he was so tipsy that he wept upon my shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="kidnap.c15.p47"><s sid="100" id="kidnap.c15.s100">I tried him, as if by accident, with a sight of Alan's button; but it was plain he had never seen or heard of it.</s> <s sid="101" id="kidnap.c15.s101">Indeed, he bore some grudge against the family and friends of Ardshiel, and before he was drunk he read me a lampoon, in very good Latin, but with a very ill meaning, which he had made in elegiac verses upon a person of that house.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="kidnap.c15.p48"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c15.s102">When I told him of my catechist, he shook his head, and said I was lucky to have got clear off.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c15.s103">"That is a very dangerous man," he said; "Duncan Mackiegh is his name; he can shoot by the ear at several yards, and has been often accused of highway robberies, and once of murder."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="kidnap.c15.p49"><s sid="104" id="kidnap.c15.s104">"The cream of it is," says I, "that he called himself a catechist."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="kidnap.c15.p50"><s sid="105" id="kidnap.c15.s105">"And why should he not?" says he, "when that is what he is.</s> <s sid="106" id="kidnap.c15.s106">It was Maclean of Duart gave it to him because he was blind.</s> <s sid="107" id="kidnap.c15.s107">But perhaps it was a peety," says my host, "for he is always on the road, going from one place to another to hear the young folk say their religion; and, doubtless, that is a great temptation to the poor man."</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="kidnap.c15.p51"><s sid="108" id="kidnap.c15.s108">At last, when my landlord could drink no more, he showed me to a bed, and I lay down in very good spirits; having travelled the greater part of that big and crooked Island of Mull, from Earraid to Torosay, fifty miles as the crow flies, and (with my wanderings) much nearer a hundred, in four days and with little fatigue.</s> <s sid="109" id="kidnap.c15.s109">Indeed I was by far in better heart and health of body at the end of that long tramp than I had been at the beginning.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XVI. THE LAD WITH THE SILVER BUTTON: ACROSS MORVEN</title>
<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c16.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c16.s1">There is a regular ferry from Torosay to Kinlochaline on the mainland.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c16.s2">Both shores of the Sound are in the country of the strong clan of the Macleans, and the people that passed the ferry with me were almost all of that clan.</s> <s sid="3" id="kidnap.c16.s3">The skipper of the boat, on the other hand, was called Neil Roy Macrob; and since Macrob was one of the names of Alan's clansmen, and Alan himself had sent me to that ferry, I was eager to come to private speech of Neil Roy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c16.p2"><s sid="4" id="kidnap.c16.s4">In the crowded boat this was of course impossible, and the passage was a very slow affair.</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c16.s5">There was no wind, and as the boat was wretchedly equipped, we could pull but two oars on one side, and one on the other.</s> <s sid="6" id="kidnap.c16.s6">The men gave way, however, with a good will, the passengers taking spells to help them, and the whole company giving the time in Gaelic boat-songs.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c16.s7">And what with the songs, and the sea-air, and the good-nature and spirit of all concerned, and the bright weather, the passage was a pretty thing to have seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c16.p3"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c16.s8">But there was one melancholy part.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c16.s9">In the mouth of Loch Aline we found a great sea-going ship at anchor; and this I supposed at first to be one of the King's cruisers which were kept along that coast, both summer and winter, to prevent communication with the French.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c16.s10">As we got a little nearer, it became plain she was a ship of merchandise; and what still more puzzled me, not only her decks, but the sea-beach also, were quite black with people, and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them.</s> <s sid="11" id="kidnap.c16.s11">Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c16.p39"><s sid="99" id="kidnap.c16.s99">So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day; until at last, Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company, and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell's ("whom," says he, "I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion"), proposed that I should make a short stage, and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c16.s100">To say truth, I was overjoyed; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore, and since my double misadventure, first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper, I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger.</s> <s sid="101" id="kidnap.c16.s101">Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain, and came in the afternoon to a small house, standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch.</s> <s sid="102" id="kidnap.c16.s102">The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side, but shone on those of Appin on the farther; the loch lay as still as a lake, only the gulls were crying round the sides of it; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c16.p43"><s sid="112" id="kidnap.c16.s112">Before we went to bed he offered me sixpence to help me on my way, out of a scanty store he kept in the turf wall of his house; at which excess of goodness I knew not what to do.</s> <s sid="113" id="kidnap.c16.s113">But at last he was so earnest with me that I thought it the more mannerly part to let him have his way, and so left him poorer than myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c18.p39"><s sid="81" id="kidnap.c18.s81">At this I did at last laugh out aloud, when to my surprise, Alan joined in, and laughed as merrily as myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c18.p41"><s sid="84" id="kidnap.c18.s84">I asked him whither we should flee; and as he told me "to the Lowlands," I was a little better inclined to go with him; for, indeed, I was growing impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle.</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c18.s85">Besides, Alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the matter, that I began to be afraid he might be right.</s> <s sid="86" id="kidnap.c18.s86">Of all deaths, I would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar's ballad) and took away my appetite for courts of justice.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="kidnap.c18.p46"><s sid="99" id="kidnap.c18.s99">Looking out between the trees, we could see a great side of mountain, running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c18.s100">It was a rough part, all hanging stone, and heather, and big scrogs of birchwood; and away at the far end towards Balachulish, little wee red soldiers were dipping up and down over hill and howe, and growing smaller every minute.</s> <s sid="101" id="kidnap.c18.s101">There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="kidnap.c18.p47"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c18.s102">Alan watched them, smiling to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="kidnap.c18.p49"><s sid="106" id="kidnap.c18.s106">So we sat again and ate and drank, in a place whence we could see the sun going down into a field of great, wild, and houseless mountains, such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion.</s> <s sid="107" id="kidnap.c18.s107">Partly as we so sat, and partly afterwards, on the way to Aucharn, each of us narrated his adventures; and I shall here set down so much of Alan's as seems either curious or needful.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="kidnap.c18.p50"><s sid="108" id="kidnap.c18.s108">It appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed; saw me, and lost me, and saw me again, as I tumbled in the roost; and at last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard.</s> <s sid="109" id="kidnap.c18.s109">It was this that put him in some hope I would maybe get to land after all, and made him leave those clues and messages which had brought me (for my sins) to that unlucky country of Appin.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c20.p3"><s sid="10" id="kidnap.c20.s10">The first peep of morning, then, showed us this horrible place, and I could see Alan knit his brow.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c20.p5"><s sid="13" id="kidnap.c20.s13">And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side, in a part where the river was split in two among three rocks.</s> <s sid="14" id="kidnap.c20.s14">It went through with a horrid thundering that made my belly quake; and there hung over the lynn a little mist of spray.</s> <s sid="15" id="kidnap.c20.s15">Alan looked neither to the right nor to the left, but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and knees to check himself, for that rock was small and he might have pitched over on the far side.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c20.s16">I had scarce time to measure the distance or to understand the peril before I had followed him, and he had caught and stopped me.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c20.p6"><s sid="17" id="kidnap.c20.s17">So there we stood, side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray, a far broader leap in front of us, and the river dinning upon all sides.</s> <s sid="18" id="kidnap.c20.s18">When I saw where I was, there came on me a deadly sickness of fear, and I put my hand over my eyes.</s> <s sid="19" id="kidnap.c20.s19">Alan took me and shook me; I saw he was speaking, but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind prevented me from hearing; only I saw his face was red with anger, and that he stamped upon the rock.</s> <s sid="20" id="kidnap.c20.s20">The same look showed me the water raging by, and the mist hanging in the air: and with that I covered my eyes again and shuddered.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c20.p7"><s sid="21" id="kidnap.c20.s21">The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips, and forced me to drink about a gill, which sent the blood into my head again.</s> <s sid="22" id="kidnap.c20.s22">Then, putting his hands to his mouth, and his mouth to my ear, he shouted, "Hang or drown!" and turning his back upon me, leaped over the farther branch of the stream, and landed safe.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c20.p8"><s sid="23" id="kidnap.c20.s23">I was now alone upon the rock, which gave me the more room; the brandy was singing in my ears; I had this good example fresh before me, and just wit enough to see that if I did not leap at once, I should never leap at all.</s> <s sid="24" id="kidnap.c20.s24">I bent low on my knees and flung myself forth, with that kind of anger of despair that has sometimes stood me in stead of courage.</s> <s sid="25" id="kidnap.c20.s25">Sure enough, it was but my hands that reached the full length; these slipped, caught again, slipped again; and I was sliddering back into the lynn, when Alan seized me, first by the hair, then by the collar, and with a great strain dragged me into safety.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c20.p9"><s sid="26" id="kidnap.c20.s26">Never a word he said, but set off running again for his life, and I must stagger to my feet and run after him.</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c20.s27">I had been weary before, but now I was sick and bruised, and partly drunken with the brandy; I kept stumbling as I ran, I had a stitch that came near to overmaster me; and when at last Alan paused under a great rock that stood there among a number of others, it was none too soon for David Balfour.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c20.p10"><s sid="28" id="kidnap.c20.s28">A great rock I have said; but by rights it was two rocks leaning together at the top, both some twenty feet high, and at the first sight inaccessible.</s> <s sid="29" id="kidnap.c20.s29">Even Alan (though you may say he had as good as four hands) failed twice in an attempt to climb them; and it was only at the third trial, and then by standing on my shoulders and leaping up with such force as I thought must have broken my collar-bone, that he secured a lodgment.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c20.s30">Once there, he let down his leathern girdle; and with the aid of that and a pair of shallow footholds in the rock, I scrambled up beside him.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c20.p11"><s sid="31" id="kidnap.c20.s31">Then I saw why we had come there; for the two rocks, being both somewhat hollow on the top and sloping one to the other, made a kind of dish or saucer, where as many as three or four men might have lain hidden.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c20.p12"><s sid="32" id="kidnap.c20.s32">All this while Alan had not said a word, and had run and climbed with such a savage, silent frenzy of hurry, that I knew that he was in mortal fear of some miscarriage.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c20.s33">Even now we were on the rock he said nothing, nor so much as relaxed the frowning look upon his face; but clapped flat down, and keeping only one eye above the edge of our place of shelter scouted all round the compass.</s> <s sid="34" id="kidnap.c20.s34">The dawn had come quite clear; we could see the stony sides of the valley, and its bottom, which was bestrewed with rocks, and the river, which went from one side to another, and made white falls; but nowhere the smoke of a house, nor any living creature but some eagles screaming round a cliff.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c20.p13"><s sid="35" id="kidnap.c20.s35">Then at last Alan smiled.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c20.p14"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c20.s36">"Ay" said he, "now we have a chance;" and then looking at me with some amusement, "Ye're no very gleg* at the jumping," said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c20.p19"><s sid="47" id="kidnap.c20.s47">I was anxious to redeem my character, and offered, if he would pour out the brandy, to run down and fill the bottle at the river.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c20.p20"><s sid="48" id="kidnap.c20.s48">"I wouldnae waste the good spirit either," says he.</s> <s sid="49" id="kidnap.c20.s49">"It's been a good friend to you this night; or in my poor opinion, ye would still be cocking on yon stone.</s> <s sid="50" id="kidnap.c20.s50">And what's mair," says he, "ye may have observed (you that's a man of so much penetration) that Alan Breck Stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar'."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c20.p21"><s sid="51" id="kidnap.c20.s51">"You!"</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c20.s52">I cried, "you were running fit to burst."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c20.p23"><s sid="56" id="kidnap.c20.s56">Accordingly, I lay down to sleep; a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks, and some bracken grew there, to be a bed to me; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c20.p33"><s sid="78" id="kidnap.c20.s78">That one good Scotch word, "birstle," was indeed the most of the story of the day that we had now to pass.</s> <s sid="79" id="kidnap.c20.s79">You are to remember that we lay on the bare top of a rock, like scones upon a girdle; the sun beat upon us cruelly; the rock grew so heated, a man could scarce endure the touch of it; and the little patch of earth and fern, which kept cooler, was only large enough for one at a time.</s> <s sid="80" id="kidnap.c20.s80">We took turn about to lie on the naked rock, which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred on a gridiron; and it ran in my mind how strange it was, that in the same climate and at only a few days' distance, I should have suffered so cruelly, first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this rock.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c20.p34"><s sid="81" id="kidnap.c20.s81">All the while we had no water, only raw brandy for a drink, which was worse than nothing; but we kept the bottle as cool as we could, burying it in the earth, and got some relief by bathing our breasts and temples.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c20.p35"><s sid="82" id="kidnap.c20.s82">The soldiers kept stirring all day in the bottom of the valley, now changing guard, now in patrolling parties hunting among the rocks.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c20.s83">These lay round in so great a number, that to look for men among them was like looking for a needle in a bottle of hay; and being so hopeless a task, it was gone about with the less care.</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c20.s84">Yet we could see the soldiers pike their bayonets among the heather, which sent a cold thrill into my vitals; and they would sometimes hang about our rock, so that we scarce dared to breathe.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c20.p36"><s sid="85" id="kidnap.c20.s85">It was in this way that I first heard the right English speech; one fellow as he went by actually clapping his hand upon the sunny face of the rock on which we lay, and plucking it off again with an oath.</s> <s sid="86" id="kidnap.c20.s86">"I tell you it's 'ot," says he; and I was amazed at the clipping tones and the odd sing-song in which he spoke, and no less at that strange trick of dropping out the letter "h."</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c20.s87">To be sure, I had heard Ransome; but he had taken his ways from all sorts of people, and spoke so imperfectly at the best, that I set down the most of it to childishness.</s> <s sid="88" id="kidnap.c20.s88">My surprise was all the greater to hear that manner of speaking in the mouth of a grown man; and indeed I have never grown used to it; nor yet altogether with the English grammar, as perhaps a very critical eye might here and there spy out even in these memoirs.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c20.p37"><s sid="89" id="kidnap.c20.s89">The tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the greater as the day went on; the rock getting still the hotter and the sun fiercer.</s> <s sid="90" id="kidnap.c20.s90">There were giddiness, and sickness, and sharp pangs like rheumatism, to be supported.</s> <s sid="91" id="kidnap.c20.s91">I minded then, and have often minded since, on the lines in our Scotch psalm:--</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c20.p39"><s sid="93" id="kidnap.c20.s93">and indeed it was only by God's blessing that we were neither of us sun-smitten.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c20.p40"><s sid="94" id="kidnap.c20.s94">At last, about two, it was beyond men's bearing, and there was now temptation to resist, as well as pain to thole.</s> <s sid="95" id="kidnap.c20.s95">For the sun being now got a little into the west, there came a patch of shade on the east side of our rock, which was the side sheltered from the soldiers.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c20.p41"><s sid="96" id="kidnap.c20.s96">"As well one death as another," said Alan, and slipped over the edge and dropped on the ground on the shadowy side.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c20.p42"><s sid="97" id="kidnap.c20.s97">I followed him at once, and instantly fell all my length, so weak was I and so giddy with that long exposure.</s> <s sid="98" id="kidnap.c20.s98">Here, then, we lay for an hour or two, aching from head to foot, as weak as water, and lying quite naked to the eye of any soldier who should have strolled that way.</s> <s sid="99" id="kidnap.c20.s99">None came, however, all passing by on the other side; so that our rock continued to be our shield even in this new position.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c20.p43"><s sid="100" id="kidnap.c20.s100">Presently we began again to get a little strength; and as the soldiers were now lying closer along the river-side, Alan proposed that we should try a start.</s> <s sid="101" id="kidnap.c20.s101">I was by this time afraid of but one thing in the world; and that was to be set back upon the rock; anything else was welcome to me; so we got ourselves at once in marching order, and began to slip from rock to rock one after the other, now crawling flat on our bellies in the shade, now making a run for it, heart in mouth.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="kidnap.c20.p44"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c20.s102">The soldiers, having searched this side of the valley after a fashion, and being perhaps somewhat sleepy with the sultriness of the afternoon, had now laid by much of their vigilance, and stood dozing at their posts or only kept a look-out along the banks of the river; so that in this way, keeping down the valley and at the same time towards the mountains, we drew steadily away from their neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c20.s103">But the business was the most wearing I had ever taken part in.</s> <s sid="104" id="kidnap.c20.s104">A man had need of a hundred eyes in every part of him, to keep concealed in that uneven country and within cry of so many and scattered sentries.</s> <s sid="105" id="kidnap.c20.s105">When we must pass an open place, quickness was not all, but a swift judgment not only of the lie of the whole country, but of the solidity of every stone on which we must set foot; for the afternoon was now fallen so breathless that the rolling of a pebble sounded abroad like a pistol shot, and would start the echo calling among the hills and cliffs.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="kidnap.c20.p45"><s sid="106" id="kidnap.c20.s106">By sundown we had made some distance, even by our slow rate of progress, though to be sure the sentry on the rock was still plainly in our view.</s> <s sid="107" id="kidnap.c20.s107">But now we came on something that put all fears out of season; and that was a deep rushing burn, that tore down, in that part, to join the glen river.</s> <s sid="108" id="kidnap.c20.s108">At the sight of this we cast ourselves on the ground and plunged head and shoulders in the water; and I cannot tell which was the more pleasant, the great shock as the cool stream went over us, or the greed with which we drank of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="kidnap.c20.p46"><s sid="109" id="kidnap.c20.s109">We lay there (for the banks hid us), drank again and again, bathed our chests, let our wrists trail in the running water till they ached with the chill; and at last, being wonderfully renewed, we got out the meal-bag and made drammach in the iron pan.</s> <s sid="110" id="kidnap.c20.s110">This, though it is but cold water mingled with oatmeal, yet makes a good enough dish for a hungry man; and where there are no means of making fire, or (as in our case) good reason for not making one, it is the chief stand-by of those who have taken to the heather.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="kidnap.c20.p47"><s sid="111" id="kidnap.c20.s111">As soon as the shadow of the night had fallen, we set forth again, at first with the same caution, but presently with more boldness, standing our full height and stepping out at a good pace of walking.</s> <s sid="112" id="kidnap.c20.s112">The way was very intricate, lying up the steep sides of mountains and along the brows of cliffs; clouds had come in with the sunset, and the night was dark and cool; so that I walked without much fatigue, but in continual fear of falling and rolling down the mountains, and with no guess at our direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="kidnap.c20.p48"><s sid="113" id="kidnap.c20.s113">The moon rose at last and found us still on the road; it was in its last quarter, and was long beset with clouds; but after awhile shone out and showed me many dark heads of mountains, and was reflected far underneath us on the narrow arm of a sea-loch.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="kidnap.c20.p49"><s sid="114" id="kidnap.c20.s114">At this sight we both paused:</s> <s sid="115" id="kidnap.c20.s115">I struck with wonder to find myself so high and walking (as it seemed to me) upon clouds; Alan to make sure of his direction.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XXI. THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE HEUGH OF CORRYNAKIEGH</title>
<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c21.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c21.s1">Early as day comes in the beginning of July, it was still dark when we reached our destination, a cleft in the head of a great mountain, with a water running through the midst, and upon the one hand a shallow cave in a rock.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c21.s2">Birches grew there in a thin, pretty wood, which a little farther on was changed into a wood of pines.</s> <s sid="3" id="kidnap.c21.s3">The burn was full of trout; the wood of cushat-doves; on the open side of the mountain beyond, whaups would be always whistling, and cuckoos were plentiful.</s> <s sid="4" id="kidnap.c21.s4">From the mouth of the cleft we looked down upon a part of Mamore, and on the sea-loch that divides that country from Appin; and this from so great a height as made it my continual wonder and pleasure to sit and behold them.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c21.p2"><s sid="5" id="kidnap.c21.s5">The name of the cleft was the Heugh of Corrynakiegh; and although from its height and being so near upon the sea, it was often beset with clouds, yet it was on the whole a pleasant place, and the five days we lived in it went happily.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c21.p3"><s sid="6" id="kidnap.c21.s6">We slept in the cave, making our bed of heather bushes which we cut for that purpose, and covering ourselves with Alan's great-coat.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c21.s7">There was a low concealed place, in a turning of the glen, where we were so bold as to make fire: so that we could warm ourselves when the clouds set in, and cook hot porridge, and grill the little trouts that we caught with our hands under the stones and overhanging banks of the burn.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c21.s8">This was indeed our chief pleasure and business; and not only to save our meal against worse times, but with a rivalry that much amused us, we spent a great part of our days at the water-side, stripped to the waist and groping about or (as they say) guddling for these fish.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c21.s9">The largest we got might have been a quarter of a pound; but they were of good flesh and flavour, and when broiled upon the coals, lacked only a little salt to be delicious.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c21.p4"><s sid="10" id="kidnap.c21.s10">In any by-time Alan must teach me to use my sword, for my ignorance had much distressed him; and I think besides, as I had sometimes the upper-hand of him in the fishing, he was not sorry to turn to an exercise where he had so much the upper-hand of me.</s> <s sid="11" id="kidnap.c21.s11">He made it somewhat more of a pain than need have been, for he stormed at me all through the lessons in a very violent manner of scolding, and would push me so close that I made sure he must run me through the body.</s> <s sid="12" id="kidnap.c21.s12">I was often tempted to turn tail, but held my ground for all that, and got some profit of my lessons; if it was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance, which is often all that is required.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c21.s13">So, though I could never in the least please my master, I was not altogether displeased with myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c21.p5"><s sid="14" id="kidnap.c21.s14">In the meanwhile, you are not to suppose that we neglected our chief business, which was to get away.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c21.p6"><s sid="15" id="kidnap.c21.s15">"It will be many a long day," Alan said to me on our first morning, "before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must get word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c21.p7"><s sid="16" id="kidnap.c21.s16">"And how shall we send that word?" says I.</s> <s sid="17" id="kidnap.c21.s17">"We are here in a desert place, which yet we dare not leave; and unless ye get the fowls of the air to be your messengers, I see not what we shall be able to do."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c21.p8"><s sid="18" id="kidnap.c21.s18">"Ay?" said Alan.</s> <s sid="19" id="kidnap.c21.s19">"Ye're a man of small contrivance, David."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c21.p9"><s sid="20" id="kidnap.c21.s20">Thereupon he fell in a muse, looking in the embers of the fire; and presently, getting a piece of wood, he fashioned it in a cross, the four ends of which he blackened on the coals.</s> <s sid="21" id="kidnap.c21.s21">Then he looked at me a little shyly.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c21.p10"><s sid="22" id="kidnap.c21.s22">"Could ye lend me my button?" says he.</s> <s sid="23" id="kidnap.c21.s23">"It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again, but I own I am laith to cut another."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c21.p11"><s sid="24" id="kidnap.c21.s24">I gave him the button; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir, he looked upon his work with satisfaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c21.p12"><s sid="25" id="kidnap.c21.s25">"Now," said he, "there is a little clachan" (what is called a hamlet in the English) "not very far from Corrynakiegh, and it has the name of Koalisnacoan.</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c21.s26">There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life, and some that I am no just so sure of.</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c21.s27">Ye see, David, there will be money set upon our heads; James himsel' is to set money on them; and as for the Campbells, they would never spare siller where there was a Stewart to be hurt.</s> <s sid="28" id="kidnap.c21.s28">If it was otherwise, I would go down to Koalisnacoan whatever, and trust my life into these people's hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c21.p13"><s sid="29" id="kidnap.c21.s29">"But being so?" said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c21.p14"><s sid="30" id="kidnap.c21.s30">"Being so," said he, "I would as lief they didnae see me.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c21.s31">There's bad folk everywhere, and what's far worse, weak ones.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c21.s32">So when it comes dark again, I will steal down into that clachan, and set this that I have been making in the window of a good friend of mine, John Breck Maccoll, a bouman* of Appin's."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c21.p15"><s sid="33" id="kidnap.c21.s33">*A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares with him the increase.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c21.p16"><s sid="34" id="kidnap.c21.s34">"With all my heart," says I; "and if he finds it, what is he to think?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c21.p17"><s sid="35" id="kidnap.c21.s35">"Well," says Alan, "I wish he was a man of more penetration, for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it!</s> <s sid="36" id="kidnap.c21.s36">But this is what I have in my mind.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c21.s37">This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie, or fiery cross, which is the signal of gathering in our clans; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise, for there it is standing in his window, and no word with it.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c21.s38">So he will say to himsel', THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c21.s39">Then he will see my button, and that was Duncan Stewart's.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c21.s40">And then he will say to himsel', THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER, AND HAS NEED OF ME."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c21.p18"><s sid="41" id="kidnap.c21.s41">"Well," said I, "it may be.</s> <s sid="42" id="kidnap.c21.s42">But even supposing so, there is a good deal of heather between here and the Forth."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c21.p19"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c21.s43">"And that is a very true word," says Alan.</s> <s sid="44" id="kidnap.c21.s44">"But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine; and he will say to himsel' (if he is a man of any penetration at all, which I misdoubt), ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES.</s> <s sid="45" id="kidnap.c21.s45">Then he will think to himsel', THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT; and then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh.</s> <s sid="46" id="kidnap.c21.s46">And if he does not, David, the devil may fly away with him, for what I care; for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c21.p20"><s sid="47" id="kidnap.c21.s47">"Eh, man," said I, drolling with him a little, "you're very ingenious!</s> <s sid="48" id="kidnap.c21.s48">But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white?"</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c21.p21"><s sid="49" id="kidnap.c21.s49">"And that is an excellent observe, Mr. Balfour of Shaws," says Alan, drolling with me; "and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him, but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it.</s> <s sid="50" id="kidnap.c21.s50">He would have to go to the school for two-three years; and it's possible we might be wearied waiting on him."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c21.p22"><s sid="51" id="kidnap.c21.s51">So that night Alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the bouman's window.</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c21.s52">He was troubled when he came back; for the dogs had barked and the folk run out from their houses; and he thought he had heard a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come to one of the doors.</s> <s sid="53" id="kidnap.c21.s53">On all accounts we lay the next day in the borders of the wood and kept a close look-out, so that if it was John Breck that came we might be ready to guide him, and if it was the red-coats we should have time to get away.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c21.p23"><s sid="54" id="kidnap.c21.s54">About noon a man was to be spied, straggling up the open side of the mountain in the sun, and looking round him as he came, from under his hand.</s> <s sid="55" id="kidnap.c21.s55">No sooner had Alan seen him than he whistled; the man turned and came a little towards us: then Alan would give another "peep!" and the man would come still nearer; and so by the sound of whistling, he was guided to the spot where we lay.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c21.p24"><s sid="56" id="kidnap.c21.s56">He was a ragged, wild, bearded man, about forty, grossly disfigured with the small pox, and looked both dull and savage.</s> <s sid="57" id="kidnap.c21.s57">Although his English was very bad and broken, yet Alan (according to his very handsome use, whenever I was by) would suffer him to speak no Gaelic.</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c21.s58">Perhaps the strange language made him appear more backward than he really was; but I thought he had little good-will to serve us, and what he had was the child of terror.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c21.p25"><s sid="59" id="kidnap.c21.s59">Alan would have had him carry a message to James; but the bouman would hear of no message.</s> <s sid="60" id="kidnap.c21.s60">"She was forget it," he said in his screaming voice; and would either have a letter or wash his hands of us.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c21.p26"><s sid="61" id="kidnap.c21.s61">I thought Alan would be gravelled at that, for we lacked the means of writing in that desert.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c21.p27"><s sid="62" id="kidnap.c21.s62">But he was a man of more resources than I knew; searched the wood until he found the quill of a cushat-dove, which he shaped into a pen; made himself a kind of ink with gunpowder from his horn and water from the running stream; and tearing a corner from his French military commission (which he carried in his pocket, like a talisman to keep him from the gallows), he sat down and wrote as follows:</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c21.p28"><s sid="63" id="kidnap.c21.s63">"DEAR KINSMAN,--Please send the money by the bearer to the place he kens of.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c21.p31"><s sid="66" id="kidnap.c21.s66">This he intrusted to the bouman, who promised to make what manner of speed he best could, and carried it off with him down the hill.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c21.p32"><s sid="67" id="kidnap.c21.s67">He was three full days gone, but about five in the evening of the third, we heard a whistling in the wood, which Alan answered; and presently the bouman came up the water-side, looking for us, right and left.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c21.s68">He seemed less sulky than before, and indeed he was no doubt well pleased to have got to the end of such a dangerous commission.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c21.p33"><s sid="69" id="kidnap.c21.s69">He gave us the news of the country; that it was alive with red-coats; that arms were being found, and poor folk brought in trouble daily; and that James and some of his servants were already clapped in prison at Fort William, under strong suspicion of complicity.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c21.s70">It seemed it was noised on all sides that Alan Breck had fired the shot; and there was a bill issued for both him and me, with one hundred pounds reward.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c21.p34"><s sid="71" id="kidnap.c21.s71">This was all as bad as could be; and the little note the bouman had carried us from Mrs. Stewart was of a miserable sadness.</s> <s sid="72" id="kidnap.c21.s72">In it she besought Alan not to let himself be captured, assuring him, if he fell in the hands of the troops, both he and James were no better than dead men.</s> <s sid="73" id="kidnap.c21.s73">The money she had sent was all that she could beg or borrow, and she prayed heaven we could be doing with it.</s> <s sid="74" id="kidnap.c21.s74">Lastly, she said, she enclosed us one of the bills in which we were described.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c21.p35"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c21.s75">This we looked upon with great curiosity and not a little fear, partly as a man may look in a mirror, partly as he might look into the barrel of an enemy's gun to judge if it be truly aimed.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c21.s76">Alan was advertised as "a small, pock-marked, active man of thirty-five or thereby, dressed in a feathered hat, a French side-coat of blue with silver buttons, and lace a great deal tarnished, a red waistcoat and breeches of black, shag;" and I as "a tall strong lad of about eighteen, wearing an old blue coat, very ragged, an old Highland bonnet, a long homespun waistcoat, blue breeches; his legs bare, low-country shoes, wanting the toes; speaks like a Lowlander, and has no beard."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c21.p36"><s sid="77" id="kidnap.c21.s77">Alan was well enough pleased to see his finery so fully remembered and set down; only when he came to the word tarnish, he looked upon his lace like one a little mortified.</s> <s sid="78" id="kidnap.c21.s78">As for myself, I thought I cut a miserable figure in the bill; and yet was well enough pleased too, for since I had changed these rags, the description had ceased to be a danger and become a source of safety.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c21.p37"><s sid="79" id="kidnap.c21.s79">"Alan," said I, "you should change your clothes."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c21.p38"><s sid="80" id="kidnap.c21.s80">"Na, troth!" said Alan, "I have nae others.</s> <s sid="81" id="kidnap.c21.s81">A fine sight I would be, if I went back to France in a bonnet!"</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c21.p39"><s sid="82" id="kidnap.c21.s82">This put a second reflection in my mind: that if I were to separate from Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest, and might go openly about my business.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c21.s83">Nor was this all; for suppose I was arrested when I was alone, there was little against me; but suppose I was taken in company with the reputed murderer, my case would begin to be grave.</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c21.s84">For generosity's sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head; but I thought of it none the less.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c21.p40"><s sid="85" id="kidnap.c21.s85">I thought of it all the more, too, when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold, and the best part of another in small change.</s> <s sid="86" id="kidnap.c21.s86">True, it was more than I had.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c21.s87">But then Alan, with less than five guineas, had to get as far as France; I, with my less than two, not beyond Queensferry; so that taking things in their proportion, Alan's society was not only a peril to my life, but a burden on my purse.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c21.p41"><s sid="88" id="kidnap.c21.s88">But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion.</s> <s sid="89" id="kidnap.c21.s89">He believed he was serving, helping, and protecting me.</s> <s sid="90" id="kidnap.c21.s90">And what could I do but hold my peace, and chafe, and take my chance of it?</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c21.p42"><s sid="91" id="kidnap.c21.s91">"It's little enough," said Alan, putting the purse in his pocket, "but it'll do my business.</s> <s sid="92" id="kidnap.c21.s92">And now, John Breck, if ye will hand me over my button, this gentleman and me will be for taking the road."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c21.p43"><s sid="93" id="kidnap.c21.s93">But the bouman, after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the Highland manner (though he wore otherwise the Lowland habit, with sea-trousers), began to roll his eyes strangely, and at last said, "Her nainsel will loss it," meaning he thought he had lost it.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="kidnap.c21.p44"><s sid="94" id="kidnap.c21.s94">"What!" cried Alan, "you will lose my button, that was my father's before me?</s> <s sid="95" id="kidnap.c21.s95">Now I will tell you what is in my mind, John Breck: it is in my mind this is the worst day's work that ever ye did since ye was born."</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="kidnap.c21.p45"><s sid="96" id="kidnap.c21.s96">And as Alan spoke, he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth, and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="kidnap.c21.p46"><s sid="97" id="kidnap.c21.s97">Perhaps the bouman was honest enough; perhaps he had meant to cheat and then, finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place, cast back to honesty as being safer; at least, and all at once, he seemed to find that button and handed it to Alan.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="kidnap.c21.p47"><s sid="98" id="kidnap.c21.s98">"Well, and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls," said Alan, and then to me, "Here is my button back again, and I thank you for parting with it, which is of a piece with all your friendships to me."</s> <s sid="99" id="kidnap.c21.s99">Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c21.s100">"For," says he, "ye have done very well by me, and set your neck at a venture, and I will always give you the name of a good man."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="kidnap.c21.p48"><s sid="101" id="kidnap.c21.s101">Lastly, the bouman took himself off by one way; and Alan and I (getting our chattels together) struck into another to resume our flight.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c22.p10"><s sid="25" id="kidnap.c22.s25">The mist rose and died away, and showed us that country lying as waste as the sea; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it, and far over to the east, a herd of deer, moving like dots.</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c22.s26">Much of it was red with heather; much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty pools; some had been burnt black in a heath fire; and in another place there was quite a forest of dead firs, standing like skeletons.</s> <s sid="27" id="kidnap.c22.s27">A wearier-looking desert man never saw; but at least it was clear of troops, which was our point.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c22.p12"><s sid="32" id="kidnap.c22.s32">Toiling and resting and toiling again, we wore away the morning; and about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c22.s33">Alan took the first watch; and it seemed to me I had scarce closed my eyes before I was shaken up to take the second.</s> <s sid="34" id="kidnap.c22.s34">We had no clock to go by; and Alan stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead; so that as soon as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east, I might know to rouse him.</s> <s sid="35" id="kidnap.c22.s35">But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather, and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; and every now and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c22.p13"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c22.s36">The last time I woke I seemed to come back from farther away, and thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c22.s37">I looked at the sprig of heath, and at that I could have cried aloud: for I saw I had betrayed my trust.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c22.s38">My head was nearly turned with fear and shame; and at what I saw, when I looked out around me on the moor, my heart was like dying in my body.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c22.s39">For sure enough, a body of horse-soldiers had come down during my sleep, and were drawing near to us from the south-east, spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in the deep parts of the heather.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c23.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c23.s1">We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood, which scrambled up a craggy hillside, and was crowned by a naked precipice.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c23.p2"><s sid="2" id="kidnap.c23.s2">"It's here," said one of the guides, and we struck up hill.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c23.p3"><s sid="3" id="kidnap.c23.s3">The trees clung upon the slope, like sailors on the shrouds of a ship, and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder, by which we mounted.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c23.p4"><s sid="4" id="kidnap.c23.s4">Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as "Cluny's Cage."</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c23.s5">The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor.</s> <s sid="6" id="kidnap.c23.s6">A tree, which grew out from the hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c23.s7">The walls were of wattle and covered with moss.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c23.s8">The whole house had something of an egg shape; and it half hung, half stood in that steep, hillside thicket, like a wasp's nest in a green hawthorn.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c23.p5"><s sid="9" id="kidnap.c23.s9">Within, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some comfort.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c23.s10">A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c23.p6"><s sid="11" id="kidnap.c23.s11">This was but one of Cluny's hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew near or moved away.</s> <s sid="12" id="kidnap.c23.s12">By this manner of living, and thanks to the affection of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety, while so many others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four or five years longer, and only went to France at last by the express command of his master.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c23.s13">There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c23.p7"><s sid="14" id="kidnap.c23.s14">When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a gillie about some cookery.</s> <s sid="15" id="kidnap.c23.s15">He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c23.s16">For all that he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise out of his place to welcome us.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c23.p8"><s sid="17" id="kidnap.c23.s17">"Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa', sir!" said he, "and bring in your friend that as yet I dinna ken the name of."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c23.p12"><s sid="28" id="kidnap.c23.s28">Thereupon we all touched glasses and drank.</s> <s sid="29" id="kidnap.c23.s29">I am sure I wished no ill to King George; and if he had been there himself in proper person, it's like he would have done as I did.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c23.s30">No sooner had I taken out the drain than I felt hugely better, and could look on and listen, still a little mistily perhaps, but no longer with the same groundless horror and distress of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c23.p13"><s sid="31" id="kidnap.c23.s31">It was certainly a strange place, and we had a strange host.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c23.s32">In his long hiding, Cluny had grown to have all manner of precise habits, like those of an old maid.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c23.s33">He had a particular place, where no one else must sit; the Cage was arranged in a particular way, which none must disturb; cookery was one of his chief fancies, and even while he was greeting us in, he kept an eye to the collops.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c23.p14"><s sid="34" id="kidnap.c23.s34">It appears, he sometimes visited or received visits from his wife and one or two of his nearest friends, under the cover of night; but for the more part lived quite alone, and communicated only with his sentinels and the gillies that waited on him in the Cage.</s> <s sid="35" id="kidnap.c23.s35">The first thing in the morning, one of them, who was a barber, came and shaved him, and gave him the news of the country, of which he was immoderately greedy.</s> <s sid="36" id="kidnap.c23.s36">There was no end to his questions; he put them as earnestly as a child; and at some of the answers, laughed out of all bounds of reason, and would break out again laughing at the mere memory, hours after the barber was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c23.p15"><s sid="37" id="kidnap.c23.s37">To be sure, there might have been a purpose in his questions; for though he was thus sequestered, and like the other landed gentlemen of Scotland, stripped by the late Act of Parliament of legal powers, he still exercised a patriarchal justice in his clan.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c23.s38">Disputes were brought to him in his hiding-hole to be decided; and the men of his country, who would have snapped their fingers at the Court of Session, laid aside revenge and paid down money at the bare word of this forfeited and hunted outlaw.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c23.s39">When he was angered, which was often enough, he gave his commands and breathed threats of punishment like any king; and his gillies trembled and crouched away from him like children before a hasty father.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c23.s40">With each of them, as he entered, he ceremoniously shook hands, both parties touching their bonnets at the same time in a military manner.</s> <s sid="41" id="kidnap.c23.s41">Altogether, I had a fair chance to see some of the inner workings of a Highland clan; and this with a proscribed, fugitive chief; his country conquered; the troops riding upon all sides in quest of him, sometimes within a mile of where he lay; and when the least of the ragged fellows whom he rated and threatened, could have made a fortune by betraying him.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c23.p16"><s sid="42" id="kidnap.c23.s42">On that first day, as soon as the collops were ready, Cluny gave them with his own hand a squeeze of a lemon (for he was well supplied with luxuries) and bade us draw in to our meal.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c23.p17"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c23.s43">"They," said he, meaning the collops, "are such as I gave his Royal Highness in this very house; bating the lemon juice, for at that time we were glad to get the meat and never fashed for kitchen.* Indeed, there were mair dragoons than lemons in my country in the year forty-six."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c23.p20"><s sid="49" id="kidnap.c23.s49">We were no sooner done eating than Cluny brought out an old, thumbed, greasy pack of cards, such as you may find in a mean inn; and his eyes brightened in his face as he proposed that we should fall to playing.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c23.p21"><s sid="50" id="kidnap.c23.s50">Now this was one of the things I had been brought up to eschew like disgrace; it being held by my father neither the part of a Christian nor yet of a gentleman to set his own livelihood and fish for that of others, on the cast of painted pasteboard.</s> <s sid="51" id="kidnap.c23.s51">To be sure, I might have pleaded my fatigue, which was excuse enough; but I thought it behoved that I should bear a testimony.</s> <s sid="52" id="kidnap.c23.s52">I must have got very red in the face, but I spoke steadily, and told them I had no call to be a judge of others, but for my own part, it was a matter in which I had no clearness.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c23.p22"><s sid="53" id="kidnap.c23.s53">Cluny stopped mingling the cards.</s> <s sid="54" id="kidnap.c23.s54">"What in deil's name is this?" says he.</s> <s sid="55" id="kidnap.c23.s55">"What kind of Whiggish, canting talk is this, for the house of Cluny Macpherson?"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c23.p23"><s sid="56" id="kidnap.c23.s56">"I will put my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour," says Alan.</s> <s sid="57" id="kidnap.c23.s57">"He is an honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says it.</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c23.s58">I bear a king's name," says he, cocking his hat; "and I and any that I call friend are company for the best.</s> <s sid="59" id="kidnap.c23.s59">But the gentleman is tired, and should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you and me.</s> <s sid="60" id="kidnap.c23.s60">And I'm fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can name."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c23.p24"><s sid="61" id="kidnap.c23.s61">"Sir," says Cluny, "in this poor house of mine I would have you to ken that any gentleman may follow his pleasure.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c23.s62">If your friend would like to stand on his head, he is welcome.</s> <s sid="63" id="kidnap.c23.s63">And if either he, or you, or any other man, is not preceesely satisfied, I will be proud to step outside with him."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c23.p25"><s sid="64" id="kidnap.c23.s64">I had no will that these two friends should cut their throats for my sake.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c23.p26"><s sid="65" id="kidnap.c23.s65">"Sir," said I, "I am very wearied, as Alan says; and what's more, as you are a man that likely has sons of your own, I may tell you it was a promise to my father."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c23.p27"><s sid="66" id="kidnap.c23.s66">"Say nae mair, say nae mair," said Cluny, and pointed me to a bed of heather in a corner of the Cage.</s> <s sid="67" id="kidnap.c23.s67">For all that he was displeased enough, looked at me askance, and grumbled when he looked.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c23.s68">And indeed it must be owned that both my scruples and the words in which I declared them, smacked somewhat of the Covenanter, and were little in their place among wild Highland Jacobites.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c23.p28"><s sid="69" id="kidnap.c23.s69">What with the brandy and the venison, a strange heaviness had come over me; and I had scarce lain down upon the bed before I fell into a kind of trance, in which I continued almost the whole time of our stay in the Cage.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c23.s70">Sometimes I was broad awake and understood what passed; sometimes I only heard voices, or men snoring, like the voice of a silly river; and the plaids upon the wall dwindled down and swelled out again, like firelight shadows on the roof.</s> <s sid="71" id="kidnap.c23.s71">I must sometimes have spoken or cried out, for I remember I was now and then amazed at being answered; yet I was conscious of no particular nightmare, only of a general, black, abiding horror--a horror of the place I was in, and the bed I lay in, and the plaids on the wall, and the voices, and the fire, and myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c23.p29"><s sid="72" id="kidnap.c23.s72">The barber-gillie, who was a doctor too, was called in to prescribe for me; but as he spoke in the Gaelic, I understood not a word of his opinion, and was too sick even to ask for a translation.</s> <s sid="73" id="kidnap.c23.s73">I knew well enough I was ill, and that was all I cared about.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c23.p30"><s sid="74" id="kidnap.c23.s74">I paid little heed while I lay in this poor pass.</s> <s sid="75" id="kidnap.c23.s75">But Alan and Cluny were most of the time at the cards, and I am clear that Alan must have begun by winning; for I remember sitting up, and seeing them hard at it, and a great glittering pile of as much as sixty or a hundred guineas on the table.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c23.s76">It looked strange enough, to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side, wattled about growing trees.</s> <s sid="77" id="kidnap.c23.s77">And even then, I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding, who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c23.p31"><s sid="78" id="kidnap.c23.s78">The luck, it seems, changed on the second day.</s> <s sid="79" id="kidnap.c23.s79">About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner, and as usual refused to eat, and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed.</s> <s sid="80" id="kidnap.c23.s80">The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage, and this dazzled and offended me.</s> <s sid="81" id="kidnap.c23.s81">Cluny sat at the table, biting the pack of cards.</s> <s sid="82" id="kidnap.c23.s82">Alan had stooped over the bed, and had his face close to my eyes; to which, troubled as they were with the fever, it seemed of the most shocking bigness.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c23.p32"><s sid="83" id="kidnap.c23.s83">He asked me for a loan of my money.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c23.p39"><s sid="95" id="kidnap.c23.s95">When I returned, he and Alan had laid the cards aside, and were questioning a gillie; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c24.p25"><s sid="65" id="kidnap.c24.s65">We set forth accordingly by this itinerary; and for the best part of three nights travelled on eerie mountains and among the well-heads of wild rivers; often buried in mist, almost continually blown and rained upon, and not once cheered by any glimpse of sunshine.</s> <s sid="66" id="kidnap.c24.s66">By day, we lay and slept in the drenching heather; by night, incessantly clambered upon break-neck hills and among rude crags.</s> <s sid="67" id="kidnap.c24.s67">We often wandered; we were often so involved in fog, that we must lie quiet till it lightened.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c24.s68">A fire was never to be thought of.</s> <s sid="69" id="kidnap.c24.s69">Our only food was drammach and a portion of cold meat that we had carried from the Cage; and as for drink, Heaven knows we had no want of water.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c25.p2"><s sid="7" id="kidnap.c25.s7">Chance served us very well; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found, where Alan was not only welcome for his name's sake but known by reputation.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c25.s8">Here then I was got to bed without delay, and a doctor fetched, who found me in a sorry plight.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c25.s9">But whether because he was a very good doctor, or I a very young, strong man, I lay bedridden for no more than a week, and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c25.p35"><s sid="73" id="kidnap.c25.s73">Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession, and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose, and which is made of old whiskey, strained honey and sweet cream, slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion.</s> <s sid="74" id="kidnap.c25.s74">The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each side of the peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness.</s> <s sid="75" id="kidnap.c25.s75">Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and "the wife's brose," reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c25.s76">But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c25.p36"><s sid="77" id="kidnap.c25.s77">"I would have ye to remark, sir," said Alan, "that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c25.p38"><s sid="80" id="kidnap.c25.s80">Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren; and then after a great number of civilities, Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c25.p39"><s sid="81" id="kidnap.c25.s81">"Ay, ye can blow" said Alan; and taking the instrument from his rival, he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin's; and then wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the "warblers."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="kidnap.c25.p49"><s sid="99" id="kidnap.c25.s99">But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c25.s100">It was a fine piece of music in itself, and nobly played; but it seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan.</s> <s sid="101" id="kidnap.c25.s101">The first notes were scarce out, before there came a change in his face; when the time quickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that piece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he had no thought but for the music.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="kidnap.c25.p50"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c25.s102">"Robin Oig," he said, when it was done, "ye are a great piper.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c25.s103">I am not fit to blow in the same kingdom with ye.</s> <s sid="104" id="kidnap.c25.s104">Body of me! ye have mair music in your sporran than I have in my head!</s> <s sid="105" id="kidnap.c25.s105">And though it still sticks in my mind that I could maybe show ye another of it with the cold steel, I warn ye beforehand--it'll no be fair!</s> <s sid="106" id="kidnap.c25.s106">It would go against my heart to haggle a man that can blow the pipes as you can!"</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c26.p3"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c26.s8">The first night, accordingly, we pushed to the house of a Maclaren in Strathire, a friend of Duncan's, where we slept the twenty-first of the month, and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make another easy stage.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c26.s9">The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the hillside in Uam Var, within view of a herd of deer, the happiest ten hours of sleep in a fine, breathing sunshine and on bone-dry ground, that I have ever tasted.</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c26.s10">That night we struck Allan Water, and followed it down; and coming to the edge of the hills saw the whole Carse of Stirling underfoot, as flat as a pancake, with the town and castle on a hill in the midst of it, and the moon shining on the Links of Forth.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="kidnap.c27.p2"><s sid="4" id="kidnap.c27.s4">I was in the long street of Queensferry before the sun was up.</s> <s sid="5" id="kidnap.c27.s5">It was a fairly built burgh, the houses of good stone, many slated; the town-hall not so fine, I thought, as that of Peebles, nor yet the street so noble; but take it altogether, it put me to shame for my foul tatters.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c27.p3"><s sid="6" id="kidnap.c27.s6">As the morning went on, and the fires began to be kindled, and the windows to open, and the people to appear out of the houses, my concern and despondency grew ever the blacker.</s> <s sid="7" id="kidnap.c27.s7">I saw now that I had no grounds to stand upon; and no clear proof of my rights, nor so much as of my own identity.</s> <s sid="8" id="kidnap.c27.s8">If it was all a bubble, I was indeed sorely cheated and left in a sore pass.</s> <s sid="9" id="kidnap.c27.s9">Even if things were as I conceived, it would in all likelihood take time to establish my contentions; and what time had I to spare with less than three shillings in my pocket, and a condemned, hunted man upon my hands to ship out of the country?</s> <s sid="10" id="kidnap.c27.s10">Truly, if my hope broke with me, it might come to the gallows yet for both of us.</s> <s sid="11" id="kidnap.c27.s11">And as I continued to walk up and down, and saw people looking askance at me upon the street or out of windows, and nudging or speaking one to another with smiles, I began to take a fresh apprehension: that it might be no easy matter even to come to speech of the lawyer, far less to convince him of my story.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="kidnap.c27.p4"><s sid="12" id="kidnap.c27.s12">For the life of me I could not muster up the courage to address any of these reputable burghers; I thought shame even to speak with them in such a pickle of rags and dirt; and if I had asked for the house of such a man as Mr. Rankeillor, I suppose they would have burst out laughing in my face.</s> <s sid="13" id="kidnap.c27.s13">So I went up and down, and through the street, and down to the harbour-side, like a dog that has lost its master, with a strange gnawing in my inwards, and every now and then a movement of despair.</s> <s sid="14" id="kidnap.c27.s14">It grew to be high day at last, perhaps nine in the forenoon; and I was worn with these wanderings, and chanced to have stopped in front of a very good house on the landward side, a house with beautiful, clear glass windows, flowering knots upon the sills, the walls new-harled* and a chase-dog sitting yawning on the step like one that was at home.</s> <s sid="15" id="kidnap.c27.s15">Well, I was even envying this dumb brute, when the door fell open and there issued forth a shrewd, ruddy, kindly, consequential man in a well-powdered wig and spectacles.</s> <s sid="16" id="kidnap.c27.s16">I was in such a plight that no one set eyes on me once, but he looked at me again; and this gentleman, as it proved, was so much struck with my poor appearance that he came straight up to me and asked me what I did.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="kidnap.c27.p5"><s sid="17" id="kidnap.c27.s17">* Newly rough-cast.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="kidnap.c27.p6"><s sid="18" id="kidnap.c27.s18">I told him I was come to the Queensferry on business, and taking heart of grace, asked him to direct me to the house of Mr. Rankeillor.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c27.p7"><s sid="19" id="kidnap.c27.s19">"Why," said he, "that is his house that I have just come out of; and for a rather singular chance, I am that very man."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c27.p8"><s sid="20" id="kidnap.c27.s20">"Then, sir," said I, "I have to beg the favour of an interview."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c27.p9"><s sid="21" id="kidnap.c27.s21">"I do not know your name," said he, "nor yet your face."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c27.p10"><s sid="22" id="kidnap.c27.s22">"My name is David Balfour," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c27.p11"><s sid="23" id="kidnap.c27.s23">"David Balfour?" he repeated, in rather a high tone, like one surprised.</s> <s sid="24" id="kidnap.c27.s24">"And where have you come from, Mr. David Balfour?" he asked, looking me pretty drily in the face.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c27.p12"><s sid="25" id="kidnap.c27.s25">"I have come from a great many strange places, sir," said I; "but I think it would be as well to tell you where and how in a more private manner."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c27.p13"><s sid="26" id="kidnap.c27.s26">He seemed to muse awhile, holding his lip in his hand, and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c27.p14"><s sid="27" id="kidnap.c27.s27">"Yes," says he, "that will be the best, no doubt."</s> <s sid="28" id="kidnap.c27.s28">And he led me back with him into his house, cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning, and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents.</s> <s sid="29" id="kidnap.c27.s29">Here he sate down, and bade me be seated; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c27.s30">"And now," says he, "if you have any business, pray be brief and come swiftly to the point.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c27.s31">Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo--do you understand that?" says he, with a keen look.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c27.p15"><s sid="32" id="kidnap.c27.s32">"I will even do as Horace says, sir," I answered, smiling, "and carry you in medias res."</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c27.s33">He nodded as if he was well pleased, and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me.</s> <s sid="34" id="kidnap.c27.s34">For all that, and though I was somewhat encouraged, the blood came in my face when I added:</s> <s sid="35" id="kidnap.c27.s35">"I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c27.p16"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c27.s36">He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c27.s37">"Well?" said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c27.p17"><s sid="38" id="kidnap.c27.s38">But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c27.p18"><s sid="39" id="kidnap.c27.s39">"Come, come, Mr. Balfour," said he, "you must continue.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c27.s40">Where were you born?"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c27.p19"><s sid="41" id="kidnap.c27.s41">"In Essendean, sir," said I, "the year 1733, the 12th of March."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c27.p20"><s sid="42" id="kidnap.c27.s42">He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book; but what that meant I knew not.</s> <s sid="43" id="kidnap.c27.s43">"Your father and mother?" said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c27.p21"><s sid="44" id="kidnap.c27.s44">"My father was Alexander Balfour, schoolmaster of that place," said I, "and my mother Grace Pitarrow; I think her people were from Angus."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c27.p22"><s sid="45" id="kidnap.c27.s45">"Have you any papers proving your identity?" asked Mr. Rankeillor.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c27.p23"><s sid="46" id="kidnap.c27.s46">"No, sir," said I, "but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell, the minister, and could be readily produced.</s> <s sid="47" id="kidnap.c27.s47">Mr. Campbell, too, would give me his word; and for that matter, I do not think my uncle would deny me."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c27.p24"><s sid="48" id="kidnap.c27.s48">"Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour?" says he.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c27.p25"><s sid="49" id="kidnap.c27.s49">"The same," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c27.p26"><s sid="50" id="kidnap.c27.s50">"Whom you have seen?" he asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c27.p27"><s sid="51" id="kidnap.c27.s51">"By whom I was received into his own house," I answered.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c27.p28"><s sid="52" id="kidnap.c27.s52">"Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason?" asked Mr. Rankeillor.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c27.p29"><s sid="53" id="kidnap.c27.s53">"I did so, sir, for my sins," said I; "for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle, that I was kidnapped within sight of this town, carried to sea, suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships, and stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c27.p30"><s sid="54" id="kidnap.c27.s54">"You say you were shipwrecked," said Rankeillor; "where was that?"</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c27.p31"><s sid="55" id="kidnap.c27.s55">"Off the south end of the Isle of Mull," said I.</s> <s sid="56" id="kidnap.c27.s56">"The name of the isle on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c27.p32"><s sid="57" id="kidnap.c27.s57">"Ah!" says he, smiling, "you are deeper than me in the geography.</s> <s sid="58" id="kidnap.c27.s58">But so far, I may tell you, this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold.</s> <s sid="59" id="kidnap.c27.s59">But you say you were kidnapped; in what sense?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c27.p33"><s sid="60" id="kidnap.c27.s60">"In the plain meaning of the word, sir," said I.</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c27.s61">"I was on my way to your house, when I was trepanned on board the brig, cruelly struck down, thrown below, and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c27.s62">I was destined for the plantations; a fate that, in God's providence, I have escaped."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c27.p34"><s sid="63" id="kidnap.c27.s63">"The brig was lost on June the 27th," says he, looking in his book, "and we are now at August the 24th.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c27.s64">Here is a considerable hiatus, Mr. Balfour, of near upon two months.</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c27.s65">It has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends; and I own I shall not be very well contented until it is set right."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c27.p35"><s sid="66" id="kidnap.c27.s66">"Indeed, sir," said I, "these months are very easily filled up; but yet before I told my story, I would be glad to know that I was talking to a friend."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c27.p36"><s sid="67" id="kidnap.c27.s67">"This is to argue in a circle," said the lawyer.</s> <s sid="68" id="kidnap.c27.s68">"I cannot be convinced till I have heard you.</s> <s sid="69" id="kidnap.c27.s69">I cannot be your friend till I am properly informed.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c27.s70">If you were more trustful, it would better befit your time of life.</s> <s sid="71" id="kidnap.c27.s71">And you know, Mr. Balfour, we have a proverb in the country that evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c27.p37"><s sid="72" id="kidnap.c27.s72">"You are not to forget, sir," said I, "that I have already suffered by my trustfulness; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that (if I rightly understand) is your employer?"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="kidnap.c27.p38"><s sid="73" id="kidnap.c27.s73">All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor, and in proportion as I gained ground, gaining confidence.</s> <s sid="74" id="kidnap.c27.s74">But at this sally, which I made with something of a smile myself, he fairly laughed aloud.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="kidnap.c27.p39"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c27.s75">"No, no," said he, "it is not so bad as that.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c27.s76">Fui, non sum.</s> <s sid="77" id="kidnap.c27.s77">I was indeed your uncle's man of business; but while you (imberbis juvenis custode remoto) were gallivanting in the west, a good deal of water has run under the bridges; and if your ears did not sing, it was not for lack of being talked about.</s> <s sid="78" id="kidnap.c27.s78">On the very day of your sea disaster, Mr. Campbell stalked into my office, demanding you from all the winds.</s> <s sid="79" id="kidnap.c27.s79">I had never heard of your existence; but I had known your father; and from matters in my competence (to be touched upon hereafter) I was disposed to fear the worst.</s> <s sid="80" id="kidnap.c27.s80">Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you; declared (what seemed improbable) that he had given you considerable sums; and that you had started for the continent of Europe, intending to fulfil your education, which was probable and praiseworthy.</s> <s sid="81" id="kidnap.c27.s81">Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell, he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life.</s> <s sid="82" id="kidnap.c27.s82">Further interrogated where you now were, protested ignorance, but believed you were in Leyden.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c27.s83">That is a close sum of his replies.</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c27.s84">I am not exactly sure that any one believed him," continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile; "and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions of mine that (in a word) he showed me to the door.</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c27.s85">We were then at a full stand; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain, we had no shadow of probation.</s> <s sid="86" id="kidnap.c27.s86">In the very article, comes Captain Hoseason with the story of your drowning; whereupon all fell through; with no consequences but concern to Mr. Campbell, injury to my pocket, and another blot upon your uncle's character, which could very ill afford it.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c27.s87">And now, Mr. Balfour," said he, "you understand the whole process of these matters, and can judge for yourself to what extent I may be trusted."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="kidnap.c27.p40"><s sid="88" id="kidnap.c27.s88">Indeed he was more pedantic than I can represent him, and placed more scraps of Latin in his speech; but it was all uttered with a fine geniality of eye and manner which went far to conquer my distrust.</s> <s sid="89" id="kidnap.c27.s89">Moreover, I could see he now treated me as if I was myself beyond a doubt; so that first point of my identity seemed fully granted.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="kidnap.c27.p41"><s sid="90" id="kidnap.c27.s90">"Sir," said I, "if I tell you my story, I must commit a friend's life to your discretion.</s> <s sid="91" id="kidnap.c27.s91">Pass me your word it shall be sacred; and for what touches myself, I will ask no better guarantee than just your face."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="kidnap.c27.p42"><s sid="92" id="kidnap.c27.s92">He passed me his word very seriously.</s> <s sid="93" id="kidnap.c27.s93">"But," said he, "these are rather alarming prolocutions; and if there are in your story any little jostles to the law, I would beg you to bear in mind that I am a lawyer, and pass lightly."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="kidnap.c27.p43"><s sid="94" id="kidnap.c27.s94">Thereupon I told him my story from the first, he listening with his spectacles thrust up and his eyes closed, so that I sometimes feared he was asleep.</s> <s sid="95" id="kidnap.c27.s95">But no such matter! he heard every word (as I found afterward) with such quickness of hearing and precision of memory as often surprised me.</s> <s sid="96" id="kidnap.c27.s96">Even strange outlandish Gaelic names, heard for that time only, he remembered and would remind me of, years after.</s> <s sid="97" id="kidnap.c27.s97">Yet when I called Alan Breck in full, we had an odd scene.</s> <s sid="98" id="kidnap.c27.s98">The name of Alan had of course rung through Scotland, with the news of the Appin murder and the offer of the reward; and it had no sooner escaped me than the lawyer moved in his seat and opened his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="kidnap.c27.p44"><s sid="99" id="kidnap.c27.s99">"I would name no unnecessary names, Mr. Balfour," said he; "above all of Highlanders, many of whom are obnoxious to the law."</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="kidnap.c27.p45"><s sid="100" id="kidnap.c27.s100">"Well, it might have been better not," said I, "but since I have let it slip, I may as well continue."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="kidnap.c27.p46"><s sid="101" id="kidnap.c27.s101">"Not at all," said Mr. Rankeillor.</s> <s sid="102" id="kidnap.c27.s102">"I am somewhat dull of hearing, as you may have remarked; and I am far from sure I caught the name exactly.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c27.s103">We will call your friend, if you please, Mr. Thomson--that there may be no reflections.</s> <s sid="104" id="kidnap.c27.s104">And in future, I would take some such way with any Highlander that you may have to mention--dead or alive."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="kidnap.c27.p47"><s sid="105" id="kidnap.c27.s105">By this, I saw he must have heard the name all too clearly, and had already guessed I might be coming to the murder.</s> <s sid="106" id="kidnap.c27.s106">If he chose to play this part of ignorance, it was no matter of mine; so I smiled, said it was no very Highland-sounding name, and consented.</s> <s sid="107" id="kidnap.c27.s107">Through all the rest of my story Alan was Mr. Thomson; which amused me the more, as it was a piece of policy after his own heart.</s> <s sid="108" id="kidnap.c27.s108">James Stewart, in like manner, was mentioned under the style of Mr. Thomson's kinsman; Colin Campbell passed as a Mr. Glen; and to Cluny, when I came to that part of my tale, I gave the name of "Mr. Jameson, a Highland chief."</s> <s sid="109" id="kidnap.c27.s109">It was truly the most open farce, and I wondered that the lawyer should care to keep it up; but, after all, it was quite in the taste of that age, when there were two parties in the state, and quiet persons, with no very high opinions of their own, sought out every cranny to avoid offence to either.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="kidnap.c27.p48"><s sid="110" id="kidnap.c27.s110">"Well, well," said the lawyer, when I had quite done, "this is a great epic, a great Odyssey of yours.</s> <s sid="111" id="kidnap.c27.s111">You must tell it, sir, in a sound Latinity when your scholarship is riper; or in English if you please, though for my part I prefer the stronger tongue.</s> <s sid="112" id="kidnap.c27.s112">You have rolled much; quae regio in terris--what parish in Scotland (to make a homely translation) has not been filled with your wanderings?</s> <s sid="113" id="kidnap.c27.s113">You have shown, besides, a singular aptitude for getting into false positions; and, yes, upon the whole, for behaving well in them.</s> <s sid="114" id="kidnap.c27.s114">This Mr. Thomson seems to me a gentleman of some choice qualities, though perhaps a trifle bloody-minded.</s> <s sid="115" id="kidnap.c27.s115">It would please me none the worse, if (with all his merits) he were soused in the North Sea, for the man, Mr. David, is a sore embarrassment.</s> <s sid="116" id="kidnap.c27.s116">But you are doubtless quite right to adhere to him; indubitably, he adhered to you.</s> <s sid="117" id="kidnap.c27.s117">It comes--we may say--he was your true companion; nor less paribus curis vestigia figit, for I dare say you would both take an orra thought upon the gallows.</s> <s sid="118" id="kidnap.c27.s118">Well, well, these days are fortunately by; and I think (speaking humanly) that you are near the end of your troubles."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="kidnap.c27.p49"><s sid="119" id="kidnap.c27.s119">As he thus moralised on my adventures, he looked upon me with so much humour and benignity that I could scarce contain my satisfaction.</s> <s sid="120" id="kidnap.c27.s120">I had been so long wandering with lawless people, and making my bed upon the hills and under the bare sky, that to sit once more in a clean, covered house, and to talk amicably with a gentleman in broadcloth, seemed mighty elevations.</s> <s sid="121" id="kidnap.c27.s121">Even as I thought so, my eye fell on my unseemly tatters, and I was once more plunged in confusion.</s> <s sid="122" id="kidnap.c27.s122">But the lawyer saw and understood me.</s> <s sid="123" id="kidnap.c27.s123">He rose, called over the stair to lay another plate, for Mr. Balfour would stay to dinner, and led me into a bedroom in the upper part of the house.</s> <s sid="124" id="kidnap.c27.s124">Here he set before me water and soap, and a comb; and laid out some clothes that belonged to his son; and here, with another apposite tag, he left me to my toilet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="kidnap.c28.p1"><s sid="1" id="kidnap.c28.s1">I made what change I could in my appearance; and blithe was I to look in the glass and find the beggarman a thing of the past, and David Balfour come to life again.</s> <s sid="2" id="kidnap.c28.s2">And yet I was ashamed of the change too, and, above all, of the borrowed clothes.</s> <s sid="3" id="kidnap.c28.s3">When I had done, Mr. Rankeillor caught me on the stair, made me his compliments, and had me again into the cabinet.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="kidnap.c28.p3"><s sid="8" id="kidnap.c28.s8">"Truly," said I, "I cannot very well join that notion with my uncle."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="kidnap.c28.p7"><s sid="25" id="kidnap.c28.s25">I thought myself it was a silly business, but I could not forget my father had a hand in it.</s> <s sid="26" id="kidnap.c28.s26">"Surely, sir, it had some note of tragedy," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="kidnap.c28.p8"><s sid="27" id="kidnap.c28.s27">"Why, no, sir, not at all," returned the lawyer.</s> <s sid="28" id="kidnap.c28.s28">"For tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute, some dignus vindice nodus; and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled, and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted.</s> <s sid="29" id="kidnap.c28.s29">However, that was not your father's view; and the end of it was, that from concession to concession on your father's part, and from one height to another of squalling, sentimental selfishness upon your uncle's, they came at last to drive a sort of bargain, from whose ill results you have recently been smarting.</s> <s sid="30" id="kidnap.c28.s30">The one man took the lady, the other the estate.</s> <s sid="31" id="kidnap.c28.s31">Now, Mr. David, they talk a great deal of charity and generosity; but in this disputable state of life, I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer, and takes all the law allows him.</s> <s sid="32" id="kidnap.c28.s32">Anyhow, this piece of Quixotry on your father's part, as it was unjust in itself, has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices.</s> <s sid="33" id="kidnap.c28.s33">Your father and mother lived and died poor folk; you were poorly reared; and in the meanwhile, what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws!</s> <s sid="34" id="kidnap.c28.s34">And I might add (if it was a matter I cared much about) what a time for Mr. Ebenezer!"</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="kidnap.c28.p9"><s sid="35" id="kidnap.c28.s35">"And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all," said I, "that a man's nature should thus change."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="kidnap.c28.p10"><s sid="36" id="kidnap.c28.s36">"True," said Mr. Rankeillor.</s> <s sid="37" id="kidnap.c28.s37">"And yet I imagine it was natural enough.</s> <s sid="38" id="kidnap.c28.s38">He could not think that he had played a handsome part.</s> <s sid="39" id="kidnap.c28.s39">Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder; those who knew it not, seeing one brother disappear, and the other succeed in the estate, raised a cry of murder; so that upon all sides he found himself evited.</s> <s sid="40" id="kidnap.c28.s40">Money was all he got by his bargain; well, he came to think the more of money.</s> <s sid="41" id="kidnap.c28.s41">He was selfish when he was young, he is selfish now that he is old; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="kidnap.c28.p11"><s sid="42" id="kidnap.c28.s42">"Well, sir," said I, "and in all this, what is my position?"</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="kidnap.c28.p12"><s sid="43" id="kidnap.c28.s43">"The estate is yours beyond a doubt," replied the lawyer.</s> <s sid="44" id="kidnap.c28.s44">"It matters nothing what your father signed, you are the heir of entail.</s> <s sid="45" id="kidnap.c28.s45">But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question.</s> <s sid="46" id="kidnap.c28.s46">A lawsuit is always expensive, and a family lawsuit always scandalous; besides which, if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out, we might find that we had burned our fingers.</s> <s sid="47" id="kidnap.c28.s47">The kidnapping, to be sure, would be a court card upon our side, if we could only prove it.</s> <s sid="48" id="kidnap.c28.s48">But it may be difficult to prove; and my advice (upon the whole) is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle, perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century, and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="kidnap.c28.p13"><s sid="49" id="kidnap.c28.s49">I told him I was very willing to be easy, and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse.</s> <s sid="50" id="kidnap.c28.s50">In the meantime (thinking to myself) I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="kidnap.c28.p14"><s sid="51" id="kidnap.c28.s51">"The great affair," I asked, "is to bring home to him the kidnapping?"</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="kidnap.c28.p15"><s sid="52" id="kidnap.c28.s52">"Surely," said Mr. Rankeillor, "and if possible, out of court.</s> <s sid="53" id="kidnap.c28.s53">For mark you here, Mr. David: we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who would swear to your reclusion; but once they were in the box, we could no longer check their testimony, and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out.</s> <s sid="54" id="kidnap.c28.s54">Which (from what you have let fall) I cannot think to be desirable."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="kidnap.c28.p16"><s sid="55" id="kidnap.c28.s55">"Well, sir," said I, "here is my way of it."</s> <s sid="56" id="kidnap.c28.s56">And I opened my plot to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="kidnap.c28.p17"><s sid="57" id="kidnap.c28.s57">"But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson?" says he, when I had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="kidnap.c28.p18"><s sid="58" id="kidnap.c28.s58">"I think so, indeed, sir," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="kidnap.c28.p19"><s sid="59" id="kidnap.c28.s59">"Dear doctor!" cries he, rubbing his brow.</s> <s sid="60" id="kidnap.c28.s60">"Dear doctor!</s> <s sid="61" id="kidnap.c28.s61">No, Mr. David, I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible.</s> <s sid="62" id="kidnap.c28.s62">I say nothing against your friend, Mr. Thomson:</s> <s sid="63" id="kidnap.c28.s63">I know nothing against him; and if I did--mark this, Mr. David!--it would be my duty to lay hands on him.</s> <s sid="64" id="kidnap.c28.s64">Now I put it to you: is it wise to meet?</s> <s sid="65" id="kidnap.c28.s65">He may have matters to his charge.</s> <s sid="66" id="kidnap.c28.s66">He may not have told you all.</s> <s sid="67" id="kidnap.c28.s67">His name may not be even Thomson!" cries the lawyer, twinkling; "for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="kidnap.c28.p20"><s sid="68" id="kidnap.c28.s68">"You must be the judge, sir," said I.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="kidnap.c28.p21"><s sid="69" id="kidnap.c28.s69">But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy, for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs. Rankeillor; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine, ere he was back harping on my proposal.</s> <s sid="70" id="kidnap.c28.s70">When and where was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson; was I sure of Mr. T.'s discretion; supposing we could catch the old fox tripping, would I consent to such and such a term of an agreement--these and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals, while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue.</s> <s sid="71" id="kidnap.c28.s71">When I had answered all of them, seemingly to his contentment, he fell into a still deeper muse, even the claret being now forgotten.</s> <s sid="72" id="kidnap.c28.s72">Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil, and set to work writing and weighing every word; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="kidnap.c28.p22"><s sid="73" id="kidnap.c28.s73">"Torrance," said he, "I must have this written out fair against to-night; and when it is done, you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me, for you will probably be wanted as a witness."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="kidnap.c28.p23"><s sid="74" id="kidnap.c28.s74">"What, sir," cried I, as soon as the clerk was gone, "are you to venture it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="kidnap.c28.p24"><s sid="75" id="kidnap.c28.s75">"Why, so it would appear," says he, filling his glass.</s> <s sid="76" id="kidnap.c28.s76">"But let us speak no more of business.</s> <s sid="77" id="kidnap.c28.s77">The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago, when I had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh.</s> <s sid="78" id="kidnap.c28.s78">Each had gone his proper errand; and when it came four o'clock, Torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master, and I, who had forgot my spectacles, was so blind without them, that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk."</s> <s sid="79" id="kidnap.c28.s79">And thereupon he laughed heartily.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="kidnap.c28.p25"><s sid="80" id="kidnap.c28.s80">I said it was an odd chance, and smiled out of politeness; but what held me all the afternoon in wonder, he kept returning and dwelling on this story, and telling it again with fresh details and laughter; so that I began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friend's folly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="kidnap.c28.p26"><s sid="81" id="kidnap.c28.s81">Towards the time I had appointed with Alan, we set out from the house, Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm, and Torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand.</s> <s sid="82" id="kidnap.c28.s82">All through the town, the lawyer was bowing right and left, and continually being button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business; and I could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county.</s> <s sid="83" id="kidnap.c28.s83">At last we were clear of the houses, and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier, the scene of my misfortune.</s> <s sid="84" id="kidnap.c28.s84">I could not look upon the place without emotion, recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more:</s> <s sid="85" id="kidnap.c28.s85">Ransome taken, I could hope, from the evil to come; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him; and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge.</s> <s sid="86" id="kidnap.c28.s86">All these, and the brig herself, I had outlived; and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scath.</s> <s sid="87" id="kidnap.c28.s87">My only thought should have been of gratitude; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="kidnap.c28.p27"><s sid="88" id="kidnap.c28.s88">I was so thinking when, upon a sudden, Mr. Rankeillor cried out, clapped his hand to his pockets, and began to laugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="kidnap.c28.p28"><s sid="89" id="kidnap.c28.s89">"Why," he cries, "if this be not a farcical adventure!</s> <s sid="90" id="kidnap.c28.s90">After all that I said, I have forgot my glasses!"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="kidnap.c28.p29"><s sid="91" id="kidnap.c28.s91">At that, of course, I understood the purpose of his anecdote, and knew that if he had left his spectacles at home, it had been done on purpose, so that he might have the benefit of Alan's help without the awkwardness of recognising him.</s> <s sid="92" id="kidnap.c28.s92">And indeed it was well thought upon; for now (suppose things to go the very worst) how could Rankeillor swear to my friend's identity, or how be made to bear damaging evidence against myself?</s> <s sid="93" id="kidnap.c28.s93">For all that, he had been a long while of finding out his want, and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through the town; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="kidnap.c28.p30"><s sid="94" id="kidnap.c28.s94">As soon as we were past the Hawes (where I recognised the landlord smoking his pipe in the door, and was amazed to see him look no older) Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march, walking behind with Torrance and sending me forward in the manner of a scout.</s> <s sid="95" id="kidnap.c28.s95">I went up the hill, whistling from time to time my Gaelic air; and at length I had the pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush.</s> <s sid="96" id="kidnap.c28.s96">He was somewhat dashed in spirits, having passed a long day alone skulking in the county, and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas.</s> <s sid="97" id="kidnap.c28.s97">But at the mere sight of my clothes, he began to brighten up; and as soon as I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I looked to him to play in what remained, he sprang into a new man.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="kidnap.c28.p31"><s sid="98" id="kidnap.c28.s98">"And that is a very good notion of yours," says he; "and I dare to say that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than Alan Breck.</s> <s sid="99" id="kidnap.c28.s99">It is not a thing (mark ye) that any one could do, but takes a gentleman of penetration.</s> <s sid="100" id="kidnap.c28.s100">But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man will be somewhat wearying to see me," says Alan.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="kidnap.c28.p32"><s sid="101" id="kidnap.c28.s101">Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor, who came up alone and was presented to my friend, Mr. Thomson.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="kidnap.c28.p33"><s sid="102" id="kidnap.c28.s102">"Mr. Thomson, I am pleased to meet you," said he.</s> <s sid="103" id="kidnap.c28.s103">"But I have forgotten my glasses; and our friend, Mr. David here" (clapping me on the shoulder), "will tell you that I am little better than blind, and that you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="kidnap.c28.p34"><s sid="104" id="kidnap.c28.s104">This he said, thinking that Alan would be pleased; but the Highlandman's vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="kidnap.c28.p35"><s sid="105" id="kidnap.c28.s105">"Why, sir," says he, stiffly, "I would say it mattered the less as we are met here for a particular end, to see justice done to Mr. Balfour; and by what I can see, not very likely to have much else in common.</s> <s sid="106" id="kidnap.c28.s106">But I accept your apology, which was a very proper one to make."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="kidnap.c28.p36"><s sid="107" id="kidnap.c28.s107">"And that is more than I could look for, Mr. Thomson," said Rankeillor, heartily.</s> <s sid="108" id="kidnap.c28.s108">"And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise, I think we should come into a nice agreement; to which end, I propose that you should lend me your arm, for (what with the dusk and the want of my glasses) I am not very clear as to the path; and as for you, Mr. David, you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with.</s> <s sid="109" id="kidnap.c28.s109">Only let me remind you, it's quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or those of--ahem--Mr. Thomson."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="kidnap.c28.p37"><s sid="110" id="kidnap.c28.s110">Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk, and Torrance and I brought up the rear.</s> </p>
