<title>CHAPTER I. THE OLD HOUSE.</title>
<p pid="1" id="cuckoo.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="cuckoo.c1.s1">"Somewhat back from the village street Stands the old-fashioned country seat."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cuckoo.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="cuckoo.c1.s2">Once upon a time in an old town, in an old street, there stood a very old house.</s> <s sid="3" id="cuckoo.c1.s3">Such a house as you could hardly find nowadays, however you searched, for it belonged to a gone-by time--a time now quite passed away.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cuckoo.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="cuckoo.c1.s4">It stood in a street, but yet it was not like a town house, for though the front opened right on to the pavement, the back windows looked out upon a beautiful, quaintly terraced garden, with old trees growing so thick and close together that in summer it was like living on the edge of a forest to be near them; and even in winter the web of their interlaced branches hid all clear view behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cuckoo.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="cuckoo.c1.s5">There was a colony of rooks in this old garden.</s> <s sid="6" id="cuckoo.c1.s6">Year after year they held their parliaments and cawed and chattered and fussed; year after year they built their nests and hatched their eggs; year after year, I _suppose_, the old ones gradually died off and the young ones took their place, though, but for knowing this _must_ be so, no one would have suspected it, for to all appearance the rooks were always the same--ever and always the same.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cuckoo.c1.p5"><s sid="7" id="cuckoo.c1.s7">Time indeed seemed to stand still in and all about the old house, as if it and the people who inhabited it had got _so_ old that they could not get any older, and had outlived the possibility of change.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cuckoo.c1.p6"><s sid="8" id="cuckoo.c1.s8">But one day at last there did come a change.</s> <s sid="9" id="cuckoo.c1.s9">Late in the dusk of an autumn afternoon a carriage drove up to the door of the old house, came rattling over the stones with a sudden noisy clatter that sounded quite impertinent, startling the rooks just as they were composing themselves to rest, and setting them all wondering what could be the matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cuckoo.c1.p7"><s sid="10" id="cuckoo.c1.s10">A little girl was the matter!</s> <s sid="11" id="cuckoo.c1.s11">A little girl in a grey merino frock and grey beaver bonnet, grey tippet and grey gloves--all grey together, even to her eyes, all except her round rosy face and bright brown hair.</s> <s sid="12" id="cuckoo.c1.s12">Her name even was rather grey, for it was Griselda.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cuckoo.c1.p8"><s sid="13" id="cuckoo.c1.s13">A gentleman lifted her out of the carriage and disappeared with her into the house, and later that same evening the gentleman came out of the house and got into the carriage which had come back for him again, and drove away.</s> <s sid="14" id="cuckoo.c1.s14">That was all that the rooks saw of the change that had come to the old house.</s> <s sid="15" id="cuckoo.c1.s15">Shall we go inside to see more?</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cuckoo.c1.p9"><s sid="16" id="cuckoo.c1.s16">Up the shallow, wide, old-fashioned staircase, past the wainscoted walls, dark and shining like a mirror, down a long narrow passage with many doors, which but for their gleaming brass handles one would not have known were there, the oldest of the three old servants led little Griselda, so tired and sleepy that her supper had been left almost untasted, to the room prepared for her.</s> <s sid="17" id="cuckoo.c1.s17">It was a queer room, for everything in the house was queer; but in the dancing light of the fire burning brightly in the tiled grate, it looked cheerful enough.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cuckoo.c1.p10"><s sid="18" id="cuckoo.c1.s18">"I am glad there's a fire," said the child.</s> <s sid="19" id="cuckoo.c1.s19">"Will it keep alight till the morning, do you think?"</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cuckoo.c1.p11"><s sid="20" id="cuckoo.c1.s20">The old servant shook her head.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cuckoo.c1.p12"><s sid="21" id="cuckoo.c1.s21">"'Twould not be safe to leave it so that it would burn till morning," she said.</s> <s sid="22" id="cuckoo.c1.s22">"When you are in bed and asleep, little missie, you won't want the fire.</s> <s sid="23" id="cuckoo.c1.s23">Bed's the warmest place."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="cuckoo.c1.p13"><s sid="24" id="cuckoo.c1.s24">"It isn't for that I want it," said Griselda; "it's for the light I like it.</s> <s sid="25" id="cuckoo.c1.s25">This house all looks so dark to me, and yet there seem to be lights hidden in the walls too, they shine so."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cuckoo.c1.p14"><s sid="26" id="cuckoo.c1.s26">The old servant smiled.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cuckoo.c1.p15"><s sid="27" id="cuckoo.c1.s27">"It will all seem strange to you, no doubt," she said; "but you'll get to like it, missie.</s> <s sid="28" id="cuckoo.c1.s28">'Tis a _good_ old house, and those that know best love it well."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cuckoo.c1.p16"><s sid="29" id="cuckoo.c1.s29">"Whom do you mean?" said Griselda.</s> <s sid="30" id="cuckoo.c1.s30">"Do you mean my great-aunts?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cuckoo.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="cuckoo.c1.s31">"Ah, yes, and others beside," replied the old woman.</s> <s sid="32" id="cuckoo.c1.s32">"The rooks love it well, and others beside.</s> <s sid="33" id="cuckoo.c1.s33">Did you ever hear tell of the <qs/>'good people,'<qe/> missie, over the sea where you come from?"</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cuckoo.c1.p18"><s sid="34" id="cuckoo.c1.s34">"Fairies, do you mean?" cried Griselda, her eyes sparkling.</s> <s sid="35" id="cuckoo.c1.s35">"Of course I've _heard_ of them, but I never saw any.</s> <s sid="36" id="cuckoo.c1.s36">Did you ever?"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cuckoo.c1.p19"><s sid="37" id="cuckoo.c1.s37">"I couldn't say," answered the old woman.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="cuckoo.c1.p20"><s sid="38" id="cuckoo.c1.s38">"My mind is not young like yours, missie, and there are times when strange memories come back to me as of sights and sounds in a dream.</s> <s sid="39" id="cuckoo.c1.s39">I am too old to see and hear as I once could.</s> <s sid="40" id="cuckoo.c1.s40">We are all old here, missie.</s> <s sid="41" id="cuckoo.c1.s41">'Twas time something young came to the old house again."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="cuckoo.c1.p21"><s sid="42" id="cuckoo.c1.s42">"How strange and queer everything seems!" thought Griselda, as she got into bed.</s> <s sid="43" id="cuckoo.c1.s43">"I don't feel as if I belonged to it a bit.</s> <s sid="44" id="cuckoo.c1.s44">And they are all _so_ old; perhaps they won't like having a child among them?"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cuckoo.c1.p22"><s sid="45" id="cuckoo.c1.s45">The very same thought that had occurred to the rooks!</s> <s sid="46" id="cuckoo.c1.s46">They could not decide as to the fors and againsts at all, so they settled to put it to the vote the next morning, and in the meantime they and Griselda all went to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cuckoo.c1.p23"><s sid="47" id="cuckoo.c1.s47">I never heard if _they_ slept well that night; after such unusual excitement it was hardly to be expected they would.</s> <s sid="48" id="cuckoo.c1.s48">But Griselda, being a little girl and not a rook, was so tired that two minutes after she had tucked herself up in bed she was quite sound asleep, and did not wake for several hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cuckoo.c1.p24"><s sid="49" id="cuckoo.c1.s49">"I wonder what it will all look like in the morning," was her last waking thought.</s> <s sid="50" id="cuckoo.c1.s50">"If it was summer now, or spring, I shouldn't mind--there would always be something nice to do then."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cuckoo.c1.p25"><s sid="51" id="cuckoo.c1.s51">As sometimes happens, when she woke again, very early in the morning, long before it was light, her thoughts went straight on with the same subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cuckoo.c1.p26"><s sid="52" id="cuckoo.c1.s52">"If it was summer now, or spring," she repeated to herself, just as if she had not been asleep at all--like the man who fell into a trance for a hundred years just as he was saying "it is bitt--" and when he woke up again finished the sentence as if nothing had happened--"erly cold."</s> <s sid="53" id="cuckoo.c1.s53">"If only it was spring," thought Griselda.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cuckoo.c1.p27"><s sid="54" id="cuckoo.c1.s54">Just as she had got so far in her thoughts, she gave a great start.</s> <s sid="55" id="cuckoo.c1.s55">What was it she heard?</s> <s sid="56" id="cuckoo.c1.s56">Could her wish have come true?</s> <s sid="57" id="cuckoo.c1.s57">Was this fairyland indeed that she had got to, where one only needs to _wish_, for it to _be_?</s> <s sid="58" id="cuckoo.c1.s58">She rubbed her eyes, but it was too dark to see; _that_ was not very fairyland-like, but her ears she felt certain had not deceived her: she was quite, quite sure that she had heard the cuckoo!</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="cuckoo.c1.p28"><s sid="59" id="cuckoo.c1.s59">She listened with all her might, but she did not hear it again.</s> <s sid="60" id="cuckoo.c1.s60">Could it, after all, have been fancy?</s> <s sid="61" id="cuckoo.c1.s61">She grew sleepy at last, and was just dropping off when--yes, there it was again, as clear and distinct as possible--"Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!" three, four, _five_ times, then perfect silence as before.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="cuckoo.c1.p29"><s sid="62" id="cuckoo.c1.s62">"What a funny cuckoo," said Griselda to herself.</s> <s sid="63" id="cuckoo.c1.s63">"I could almost fancy it was in the house.</s> <s sid="64" id="cuckoo.c1.s64">I wonder if my great-aunts have a tame cuckoo in a cage?</s> <s sid="65" id="cuckoo.c1.s65">I don't _think_ I ever heard of such a thing, but this is such a queer house; everything seems different in it--perhaps they have a tame cuckoo.</s> <s sid="66" id="cuckoo.c1.s66">I'll ask them in the morning.</s> <s sid="67" id="cuckoo.c1.s67">It's very nice to hear, whatever it is."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cuckoo.c1.p30"><s sid="68" id="cuckoo.c1.s68">And, with a pleasant feeling of companionship, a sense that she was not the only living creature awake in this dark world, Griselda lay listening, contentedly enough, for the sweet, fresh notes of the cuckoo's friendly greeting.</s> <s sid="69" id="cuckoo.c1.s69">But before it sounded again through the silent house she was once more fast asleep.</s> <s sid="70" id="cuckoo.c1.s70">And this time she slept till daylight had found its way into all but the _very_ darkest nooks and crannies of the ancient dwelling.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="cuckoo.c1.p31"><s sid="71" id="cuckoo.c1.s71">She dressed herself carefully, for she had been warned that her aunts loved neatness and precision; she fastened each button of her grey frock, and tied down her hair as smooth as such a brown tangle _could_ be tied down; and, absorbed with these weighty cares, she forgot all about the cuckoo for the time.</s> <s sid="72" id="cuckoo.c1.s72">It was not till she was sitting at breakfast with her aunts that she remembered it, or rather was reminded of it, by some little remark that was made about the friendly robins on the terrace walk outside.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="cuckoo.c1.p32"><s sid="73" id="cuckoo.c1.s73">"Oh, aunt," she exclaimed, stopping short half-way the journey to her mouth of a spoonful of bread and milk, "have you got a cuckoo in a cage?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="cuckoo.c1.p33"><s sid="74" id="cuckoo.c1.s74">"A cuckoo in a cage," repeated her elder aunt, Miss Grizzel; "what is the child talking about?"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="cuckoo.c1.p34"><s sid="75" id="cuckoo.c1.s75">"In a cage!" echoed Miss Tabitha, "a cuckoo in a cage!"</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="cuckoo.c1.p35"><s sid="76" id="cuckoo.c1.s76">"There is a cuckoo somewhere in the house," said Griselda; "I heard it in the night.</s> <s sid="77" id="cuckoo.c1.s77">It couldn't have been out-of-doors, could it?</s> <s sid="78" id="cuckoo.c1.s78">It would be too cold."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="cuckoo.c1.p36"><s sid="79" id="cuckoo.c1.s79">The aunts looked at each other with a little smile.</s> <s sid="80" id="cuckoo.c1.s80">"So like her grandmother," they whispered.</s> <s sid="81" id="cuckoo.c1.s81">Then said Miss Grizzel--</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="cuckoo.c1.p37"><s sid="82" id="cuckoo.c1.s82">"We have a cuckoo, my dear, though it isn't in a cage, and it isn't exactly the sort of cuckoo you are thinking of.</s> <s sid="83" id="cuckoo.c1.s83">It lives in a clock."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="cuckoo.c1.p38"><s sid="84" id="cuckoo.c1.s84">"In a clock," repeated Miss Tabitha, as if to confirm her sister's statement.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="cuckoo.c1.p39"><s sid="85" id="cuckoo.c1.s85">"In a clock!" exclaimed Griselda, opening her grey eyes very wide.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="cuckoo.c1.p40"><s sid="86" id="cuckoo.c1.s86">It sounded something like the three bears, all speaking one after the other, only Griselda's voice was not like Tiny's; it was the loudest of the three.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="cuckoo.c1.p41"><s sid="87" id="cuckoo.c1.s87">"In a clock!" she exclaimed; "but it can't be alive, then?"</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="cuckoo.c1.p42"><s sid="88" id="cuckoo.c1.s88">"Why not?" said Miss Grizzel.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="cuckoo.c1.p43"><s sid="89" id="cuckoo.c1.s89">"I don't know," replied Griselda, looking puzzled.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="cuckoo.c1.p44"><s sid="90" id="cuckoo.c1.s90">"I knew a little girl once," pursued Miss Grizzel, "who was quite of opinion the cuckoo _was_ alive, and nothing would have persuaded her it was not.</s> <s sid="91" id="cuckoo.c1.s91">Finish your breakfast, my dear, and then if you like you shall come with me and see the cuckoo for yourself."</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="cuckoo.c1.p45"><s sid="92" id="cuckoo.c1.s92">"Thank you, Aunt Grizzel," said Griselda, going on with her bread and milk.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="cuckoo.c1.p46"><s sid="93" id="cuckoo.c1.s93">"Yes," said Miss Tabitha, "you shall see the cuckoo for yourself."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="cuckoo.c1.p47"><s sid="94" id="cuckoo.c1.s94">"Thank you, Aunt Tabitha," said Griselda.</s> <s sid="95" id="cuckoo.c1.s95">It was rather a bother to have always to say "thank you," or "no, thank you," twice, but Griselda thought it was polite to do so, as Aunt Tabitha always repeated everything that Aunt Grizzel said.</s> <s sid="96" id="cuckoo.c1.s96">It wouldn't have mattered so much if Aunt Tabitha had said it _at once_ after Miss Grizzel, but as she generally made a little pause between, it was sometimes rather awkward.</s> <s sid="97" id="cuckoo.c1.s97">But of course it was better to say "thank you" or "no, thank you" twice over than to hurt Aunt Tabitha's feelings.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="cuckoo.c1.p48"><s sid="98" id="cuckoo.c1.s98">After breakfast Aunt Grizzel was as good as her word.</s> <s sid="99" id="cuckoo.c1.s99">She took Griselda through several of the rooms in the house, pointing out all the curiosities, and telling all the histories of the rooms and their contents; and Griselda liked to listen, only in every room they came to, she wondered _when_ they would get to the room where lived the cuckoo.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="cuckoo.c1.p49"><s sid="100" id="cuckoo.c1.s100">Aunt Tabitha did not come with them, for she was rather rheumatic.</s> <s sid="101" id="cuckoo.c1.s101">On the whole, Griselda was not sorry.</s> <s sid="102" id="cuckoo.c1.s102">It would have taken such a _very_ long time, you see, to have had all the histories twice over, and possibly, if Griselda had got tired, she might have forgotten about the "thank you's" or "no, thank you's" twice over.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="cuckoo.c1.p50"><s sid="103" id="cuckoo.c1.s103">The old house looked quite as queer and quaint by daylight as it had seemed the evening before; almost more so indeed, for the view from the windows added to the sweet, odd "old-fashionedness" of everything.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="cuckoo.c1.p51"><s sid="104" id="cuckoo.c1.s104">"We have beautiful roses in summer," observed Miss Grizzel, catching sight of the direction in which the child's eyes were wandering.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="cuckoo.c1.p52"><s sid="105" id="cuckoo.c1.s105">"I wish it was summer.</s> <s sid="106" id="cuckoo.c1.s106">I do love summer," said Griselda.</s> <s sid="107" id="cuckoo.c1.s107">"But there is a very rosy scent in the rooms even now, Aunt Grizzel, though it is winter, or nearly winter."</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="cuckoo.c1.p53"><s sid="108" id="cuckoo.c1.s108">Miss Grizzel looked pleased.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="cuckoo.c1.p54"><s sid="109" id="cuckoo.c1.s109">"My pot-pourri," she explained.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="cuckoo.c1.p55"><s sid="110" id="cuckoo.c1.s110">They were just then standing in what she called the "great saloon," a handsome old room, furnished with gold-and-white chairs, that must once have been brilliant, and faded yellow damask hangings.</s> <s sid="111" id="cuckoo.c1.s111">A feeling of awe had crept over Griselda as they entered this ancient drawing-room.</s> <s sid="112" id="cuckoo.c1.s112">What grand parties there must have been in it long ago!</s> <s sid="113" id="cuckoo.c1.s113">But as for dancing in it _now_--dancing, or laughing, or chattering--such a thing was quite impossible to imagine!</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="cuckoo.c1.p56"><s sid="114" id="cuckoo.c1.s114">Miss Grizzel crossed the room to where stood in one corner a marvellous Chinese cabinet, all black and gold and carving.</s> <s sid="115" id="cuckoo.c1.s115">It was made in the shape of a temple, or a palace--Griselda was not sure which.</s> <s sid="116" id="cuckoo.c1.s116">Any way, it was very delicious and wonderful.</s> <s sid="117" id="cuckoo.c1.s117">At the door stood, one on each side, two solemn mandarins; or, to speak more correctly, perhaps I should say, a mandarin and his wife, for the right-hand figure was evidently intended to be a lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="cuckoo.c1.p57"><s sid="118" id="cuckoo.c1.s118">Miss Grizzel gently touched their heads.</s> <s sid="119" id="cuckoo.c1.s119">Forthwith, to Griselda's astonishment, they began solemnly to nod.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="cuckoo.c1.p58"><s sid="120" id="cuckoo.c1.s120">"Oh, how do you make them do that, Aunt Grizzel?" she exclaimed.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="cuckoo.c1.p59"><s sid="121" id="cuckoo.c1.s121">"Never you mind, my dear; it wouldn't do for _you_ to try to make them nod.</s> <s sid="122" id="cuckoo.c1.s122">They wouldn't like it," replied Miss Grizzel mysteriously.</s> <s sid="123" id="cuckoo.c1.s123">"Respect to your elders, my dear, always remember that.</s> <s sid="124" id="cuckoo.c1.s124">The mandarins are _many_ years older than you--older than I myself, in fact."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="cuckoo.c1.p60"><s sid="125" id="cuckoo.c1.s125">Griselda wondered, if this were so, how it was that Miss Grizzel took such liberties with them herself, but she said nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="cuckoo.c1.p61"><s sid="126" id="cuckoo.c1.s126">"Here is my last summer's pot-pourri," continued Miss Grizzel, touching a great china jar on a little stand, close beside the cabinet.</s> <s sid="127" id="cuckoo.c1.s127">"You may smell it, my dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="cuckoo.c1.p62"><s sid="128" id="cuckoo.c1.s128">Nothing loth, Griselda buried her round little nose in the fragrant leaves.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="cuckoo.c1.p63"><s sid="129" id="cuckoo.c1.s129">"It's lovely," she said.</s> <s sid="130" id="cuckoo.c1.s130">"May I smell it whenever I like, Aunt Grizzel?"</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="cuckoo.c1.p64"><s sid="131" id="cuckoo.c1.s131">"We shall see," replied her aunt.</s> <s sid="132" id="cuckoo.c1.s132">"It isn't _every_ little girl, you know, that we could trust to come into the great saloon alone."</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="cuckoo.c1.p65"><s sid="133" id="cuckoo.c1.s133">"No," said Griselda meekly.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="cuckoo.c1.p67"><s sid="136" id="cuckoo.c1.s136">"It is on the stroke of ten," said Miss Grizzel, consulting her watch; "now, my dear, you shall make acquaintance with our cuckoo."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="cuckoo.c1.p69"><s sid="142" id="cuckoo.c1.s142">Miss Grizzel stood perfectly still, looking up at the clock; Griselda beside her, in breathless expectation.</s> <s sid="143" id="cuckoo.c1.s143">Presently there came a sort of distant rumbling.</s> <s sid="144" id="cuckoo.c1.s144">_Something_ was going to happen.</s> <s sid="145" id="cuckoo.c1.s145">Suddenly two little doors above the clock face, which Griselda had not known were there, sprang open with a burst and out flew a cuckoo, flapped his wings, and uttered his pretty cry, "Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!"</s> <s sid="146" id="cuckoo.c1.s146">Miss Grizzel counted aloud, "Seven, eight, nine, ten."</s> <s sid="147" id="cuckoo.c1.s147">"Yes, he never makes a mistake," she added triumphantly.</s> <s sid="148" id="cuckoo.c1.s148">"All these long years I have never known him wrong.</s> <s sid="149" id="cuckoo.c1.s149">There are no such clocks made nowadays, I can assure you, my dear."</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="cuckoo.c1.p71" type="speech"><s sid="153" id="cuckoo.c1.s153">Again Miss Grizzel smiled, the same odd yet pleased smile that Griselda had seen on her face at breakfast.</s> <s sid="154" id="cuckoo.c1.s154">"Just what Sybilla used to say," she murmured.</s> <s sid="155" id="cuckoo.c1.s155">"Well, my dear," she added aloud, "it is quite right he _should_ say, <qs/>'How do you do?'<qe/> to you.</s> <s sid="156" id="cuckoo.c1.s156">It is the first time he has seen _you_, though many a year ago he knew your dear grandmother, and your father, too, when he was a little boy.</s> <s sid="157" id="cuckoo.c1.s157">You will find him a good friend, and one that can teach you many lessons."</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="cuckoo.c1.p72"><s sid="158" id="cuckoo.c1.s158">"What, Aunt Grizzel?" inquired Griselda, looking puzzled.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="cuckoo.c1.p73"><s sid="159" id="cuckoo.c1.s159">"Punctuality, for one thing, and faithful discharge of duty," replied Miss Grizzel.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="cuckoo.c1.p74"><s sid="160" id="cuckoo.c1.s160">"May I come to see the cuckoo--to watch for him coming out, sometimes?" asked Griselda, who felt as if she could spend all day looking up at the clock, watching for her little friend's appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="cuckoo.c1.p75"><s sid="161" id="cuckoo.c1.s161">"You will see him several times a day," said her aunt, "for it is in this little room I intend you to prepare your tasks.</s> <s sid="162" id="cuckoo.c1.s162">It is nice and quiet, and nothing to disturb you, and close to the room where your Aunt Tabitha and I usually sit."</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="cuckoo.c1.p76"><s sid="163" id="cuckoo.c1.s163">So saying, Miss Grizzel opened a second door in the little ante-room, and, to Griselda's surprise, at the foot of a short flight of stairs through another door, half open, she caught sight of her Aunt Tabitha, knitting quietly by the fire, in the room in which they had breakfasted.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="cuckoo.c1.p78"><s sid="167" id="cuckoo.c1.s167">"Oh yes, you will, my dear, very soon," said her aunt encouragingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cuckoo.c2.p5"><s sid="20" id="cuckoo.c2.s20">"I wouldn't mind so much," said poor Griselda, one day, "if it was any good.</s> <s sid="21" id="cuckoo.c2.s21">But you see, Aunt Grizzel, it isn't.</s> <s sid="22" id="cuckoo.c2.s22">For I'm just as likely to do the _proving_ wrong as the sum itself--more likely, for I'm always so tired when I get to the proving--and so all that's proved is that _something's_ wrong, and I'm sure that isn't any good, except to make me cross."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cuckoo.c2.p14"><s sid="47" id="cuckoo.c2.s47">"I wish it was twelve o'clock," she said to herself anxiously more than once.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cuckoo.c2.p15"><s sid="48" id="cuckoo.c2.s48">If only the clock had not been so very high up on the wall, she would have been tempted to climb up and open the little doors, and peep in to satisfy herself as to the cuckoo's condition.</s> <s sid="49" id="cuckoo.c2.s49">But there was no possibility of this.</s> <s sid="50" id="cuckoo.c2.s50">The clock was far, very far above her reach, and there was no high piece of furniture standing near, upon which she could have climbed to get to it.</s> <s sid="51" id="cuckoo.c2.s51">There was nothing to be done but to wait for twelve o'clock.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cuckoo.c2.p23"><s sid="62" id="cuckoo.c2.s62">Merrybrow Hall was a large house, quite as old and much grander, but not nearly so wonderful as the home of Griselda's aunts.</s> <s sid="63" id="cuckoo.c2.s63">It was six miles off, and it took a very long time indeed to drive there in the rumbling old chariot, for the old horses were fat and wheezy, and the old coachman fat and wheezy too.</s> <s sid="64" id="cuckoo.c2.s64">Lady Lavander was, of course, old too--very old indeed, and rather grumpy and very deaf.</s> <s sid="65" id="cuckoo.c2.s65">Miss Grizzel and Miss Tabitha had the greatest respect for her; she always called them "My dear," as if they were quite girls, and they listened to all she said as if her words were of gold.</s> <s sid="66" id="cuckoo.c2.s66">For some mysterious reason she had been invited to be Griselda's godmother; but, as she had never shown her any proof of affection beyond giving her a prayer-book, and hoping, whenever she saw her, that she was "a good little miss," Griselda did not feel any particular cause for gratitude to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cuckoo.c2.p24"><s sid="67" id="cuckoo.c2.s67">The drive seemed longer and duller than ever this afternoon, but Griselda bore it meekly; and when Lady Lavander, as usual, expressed her hopes about her, the little girl looked down modestly, feeling her cheeks grow scarlet.</s> <s sid="68" id="cuckoo.c2.s68">"I am not a good little girl at all," she felt inclined to call out.</s> <s sid="69" id="cuckoo.c2.s69">"I'm very bad and cruel.</s> <s sid="70" id="cuckoo.c2.s70">I believe I've killed the dear little cuckoo."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cuckoo.c2.p26"><s sid="73" id="cuckoo.c2.s73">All the way home Griselda felt in a fever of impatience to rush up to the ante-room and see if the cuckoo was all right again.</s> <s sid="74" id="cuckoo.c2.s74">It was late and dark when the chariot at last stopped at the door of the old house.</s> <s sid="75" id="cuckoo.c2.s75">Miss Grizzel got out slowly, and still more slowly Miss Tabitha followed her.</s> <s sid="76" id="cuckoo.c2.s76">Griselda was obliged to restrain herself and move demurely.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cuckoo.c4.p2"><s sid="2" id="cuckoo.c4.s2">_How_ she managed it she never knew; but, somehow or other, it _was_ managed.</s> <s sid="3" id="cuckoo.c4.s3">She seemed to slide up the chain just as easily as in a general way she would have slidden down, only without any disagreeable anticipation of a bump at the end of the journey.</s> <s sid="4" id="cuckoo.c4.s4">And when she got to the top how wonderfully different it looked from anything she could have expected!</s> <s sid="5" id="cuckoo.c4.s5">The doors stood open, and Griselda found them quite big enough, or herself quite small enough--which it was she couldn't tell, and as it was all a matter of fancy she decided not to trouble to inquire--to pass through quite comfortably.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cuckoo.c4.p3"><s sid="6" id="cuckoo.c4.s6">And inside there was the most charming little snuggery imaginable.</s> <s sid="7" id="cuckoo.c4.s7">It was something like a saloon railway carriage--it seemed to be all lined and carpeted and everything, with rich mossy red velvet; there was a little round table in the middle and two arm-chairs, on one of which sat the cuckoo--"quite like other people," thought Griselda to herself--while the other, as he pointed out to Griselda by a little nod, was evidently intended for her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cuckoo.c4.p4"><s sid="8" id="cuckoo.c4.s8">"Thank you," said she, sitting down on the chair as she spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cuckoo.c4.p5"><s sid="9" id="cuckoo.c4.s9">"Are you comfortable?" inquired the cuckoo.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cuckoo.c4.p6"><s sid="10" id="cuckoo.c4.s10">"Quite," replied Griselda, looking about her with great satisfaction.</s> <s sid="11" id="cuckoo.c4.s11">"Are all cuckoo clocks like this when you get up inside them?" she inquired.</s> <s sid="12" id="cuckoo.c4.s12">"I can't think how there's room for this dear little place between the clock and the wall.</s> <s sid="13" id="cuckoo.c4.s13">Is it a hole cut out of the wall on purpose, cuckoo?"</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cuckoo.c4.p7"><s sid="14" id="cuckoo.c4.s14">"Hush!" said the cuckoo, "we've got other things to talk about.</s> <s sid="15" id="cuckoo.c4.s15">First, shall I lend you one of my mantles?</s> <s sid="16" id="cuckoo.c4.s16">You may feel cold."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cuckoo.c4.p8"><s sid="17" id="cuckoo.c4.s17">"I don't just now," replied Griselda; "but perhaps I _might_."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cuckoo.c4.p9"><s sid="18" id="cuckoo.c4.s18">She looked at her little bare feet as she spoke, and wondered why _they_ weren't cold, for it was very chilblainy weather.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cuckoo.c4.p10"><s sid="19" id="cuckoo.c4.s19">The cuckoo stood up, and with one of his claws reached from a corner where it was hanging a cloak which Griselda had not before noticed.</s> <s sid="20" id="cuckoo.c4.s20">For it was hanging wrong side out, and the lining was red velvet, very like what the sides of the little room were covered with, so it was no wonder she had not noticed it.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cuckoo.c4.p11"><s sid="21" id="cuckoo.c4.s21">Had it been hanging the _right_ side out she must have done so; this side was so very wonderful!</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cuckoo.c4.p12"><s sid="22" id="cuckoo.c4.s22">It was all feathers--feathers of every shade and colour, but beautifully worked in, somehow, so as to lie quite smoothly and evenly, one colour melting away into another like those in a prism, so that you could hardly tell where one began and another ended.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="cuckoo.c4.p13"><s sid="23" id="cuckoo.c4.s23">"What a _lovely_ cloak!" said Griselda, wrapping it round her and feeling even more comfortable than before, as she watched the rays of the little lamp in the roof--I think I was forgetting to tell you that the cuckoo's boudoir was lighted by a dear little lamp set into the red velvet roof like a pearl in a ring--playing softly on the brilliant colours of the feather mantle.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cuckoo.c4.p14"><s sid="24" id="cuckoo.c4.s24">"It's better than lovely," said the cuckoo, "as you shall see.</s> <s sid="25" id="cuckoo.c4.s25">Now, Griselda," he continued, in the tone of one coming to business--"now, Griselda, let us talk."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cuckoo.c4.p15"><s sid="26" id="cuckoo.c4.s26">"We have been talking," said Griselda, "ever so long.</s> <s sid="27" id="cuckoo.c4.s27">I am very comfortable.</s> <s sid="28" id="cuckoo.c4.s28">When you say 'let us talk' like that, it makes me forget all I wanted to say.</s> <s sid="29" id="cuckoo.c4.s29">Just let me sit still and say whatever comes into my head."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cuckoo.c4.p16"><s sid="30" id="cuckoo.c4.s30">"That won't do," said the cuckoo; "we must have a plan of action."</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cuckoo.c4.p17"><s sid="31" id="cuckoo.c4.s31">"A what?" said Griselda.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cuckoo.c4.p18"><s sid="32" id="cuckoo.c4.s32">"You see you _have_ a great deal to learn," said the cuckoo triumphantly.</s> <s sid="33" id="cuckoo.c4.s33">"You don't understand what I say."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cuckoo.c4.p19"><s sid="34" id="cuckoo.c4.s34">"But I didn't come up here to learn," said Griselda; "I can do that down there;" and she nodded her head in the direction of the ante-room table.</s> <s sid="35" id="cuckoo.c4.s35">"I want to play."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="cuckoo.c4.p20" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="cuckoo.c4.s36">"Just so," said the cuckoo; "that's what I want to talk about.</s> <s sid="37" id="cuckoo.c4.s37">What do you call <qs/>'play'<qe/>--blindman's-buff and that sort of thing?"</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="cuckoo.c4.p21"><s sid="38" id="cuckoo.c4.s38">"No," said Griselda, considering.</s> <s sid="39" id="cuckoo.c4.s39">"I'm getting rather too big for that kind of play.</s> <s sid="40" id="cuckoo.c4.s40">Besides, cuckoo, you and I alone couldn't have much fun at blindman's-buff; there'd be only me to catch you or you to catch me."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cuckoo.c4.p22"><s sid="41" id="cuckoo.c4.s41">"Oh, we could easily get more," said the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="42" id="cuckoo.c4.s42">"The mandarins would be pleased to join."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cuckoo.c4.p23"><s sid="43" id="cuckoo.c4.s43">"The mandarins!" repeated Griselda.</s> <s sid="44" id="cuckoo.c4.s44">"Why, cuckoo, they're not alive!</s> <s sid="45" id="cuckoo.c4.s45">How could they play?"</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cuckoo.c4.p24"><s sid="46" id="cuckoo.c4.s46">The cuckoo looked at her gravely for a minute, then shook his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cuckoo.c4.p25"><s sid="47" id="cuckoo.c4.s47">"You have a _great_ deal to learn," he said solemnly.</s> <s sid="48" id="cuckoo.c4.s48">"Don't you know that _everything's_ alive?"</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cuckoo.c4.p26"><s sid="49" id="cuckoo.c4.s49">"No," said Griselda, "I don't; and I don't know what you mean, and I don't think I want to know what you mean.</s> <s sid="50" id="cuckoo.c4.s50">I want to talk about playing."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cuckoo.c4.p27"><s sid="51" id="cuckoo.c4.s51">"Well," said the cuckoo, "talk."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="cuckoo.c4.p28"><s sid="52" id="cuckoo.c4.s52">"What I call playing," pursued Griselda, "is--I have thought about it now, you see--is being amused.</s> <s sid="53" id="cuckoo.c4.s53">If you will amuse me, cuckoo, I will count that you are playing with me."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="cuckoo.c4.p29"><s sid="54" id="cuckoo.c4.s54">"How shall I amuse you?" inquired he.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cuckoo.c4.p30"><s sid="55" id="cuckoo.c4.s55">"Oh, that's for you to find out!" exclaimed Griselda.</s> <s sid="56" id="cuckoo.c4.s56">"You might tell me fairy stories, you know: if you're a fairy you should know lots; or--oh yes, of course that would be far nicer--if you are a fairy you might take me with you to fairyland."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="cuckoo.c4.p31"><s sid="57" id="cuckoo.c4.s57">Again the cuckoo shook his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="cuckoo.c4.p32"><s sid="58" id="cuckoo.c4.s58">"That," said he, "I cannot do."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="cuckoo.c4.p33"><s sid="59" id="cuckoo.c4.s59">"Why not?" said Griselda.</s> <s sid="60" id="cuckoo.c4.s60">"Lots of children have been there."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="cuckoo.c4.p34"><s sid="61" id="cuckoo.c4.s61">"I doubt it," said the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="62" id="cuckoo.c4.s62">"_Some_ may have been, but not lots.</s> <s sid="63" id="cuckoo.c4.s63">And some may have thought they had been there who hadn't really been there at all.</s> <s sid="64" id="cuckoo.c4.s64">And as to those who have been there, you may be sure of one thing--they were not _taken_, they found their own way.</s> <s sid="65" id="cuckoo.c4.s65">No one ever was _taken_ to fairyland--to the real fairyland.</s> <s sid="66" id="cuckoo.c4.s66">They may have been taken to the neighbouring countries, but not to fairyland itself."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="cuckoo.c4.p35"><s sid="67" id="cuckoo.c4.s67">"And how is one ever to find one's own way there?" asked Griselda.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="cuckoo.c4.p36"><s sid="68" id="cuckoo.c4.s68">"That I cannot tell you either," replied the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="69" id="cuckoo.c4.s69">"There are many roads there; you may find yours some day.</s> <s sid="70" id="cuckoo.c4.s70">And if ever you do find it, be sure you keep what you see of it well swept and clean, and then you may see further after a while.</s> <s sid="71" id="cuckoo.c4.s71">Ah, yes, there are many roads and many doors into fairyland!"</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="cuckoo.c4.p37"><s sid="72" id="cuckoo.c4.s72">"Doors!" cried Griselda.</s> <s sid="73" id="cuckoo.c4.s73">"Are there any doors into fairyland in this house?"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="cuckoo.c4.p38"><s sid="74" id="cuckoo.c4.s74">"Several," said the cuckoo; "but don't waste your time looking for them at present.</s> <s sid="75" id="cuckoo.c4.s75">It would be no use."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="cuckoo.c4.p39"><s sid="76" id="cuckoo.c4.s76">"Then how will you amuse me?" inquired Griselda, in a rather disappointed tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="cuckoo.c4.p40"><s sid="77" id="cuckoo.c4.s77">"Don't you care to go anywhere except to fairyland?" said the cuckoo.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="cuckoo.c4.p41"><s sid="78" id="cuckoo.c4.s78">"Oh yes, there are lots of places I wouldn't mind seeing.</s> <s sid="79" id="cuckoo.c4.s79">Not geography sort of places--it would be just like lessons to go to India and Africa and all those places--but _queer_ places, like the mines where the goblins make diamonds and precious stones, and the caves down under the sea where the mermaids live.</s> <s sid="80" id="cuckoo.c4.s80">And--oh, I've just thought--now I'm so nice and little, I _would_ like to go all over the mandarins' palace in the great saloon."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="cuckoo.c4.p42"><s sid="81" id="cuckoo.c4.s81">"That can be easily managed," said the cuckoo; "but--excuse me for an instant," he exclaimed suddenly.</s> <s sid="82" id="cuckoo.c4.s82">He gave a spring forward and disappeared.</s> <s sid="83" id="cuckoo.c4.s83">Then Griselda heard his voice outside the doors, "Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo."</s> <s sid="84" id="cuckoo.c4.s84">It was three o'clock.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="cuckoo.c4.p43"><s sid="85" id="cuckoo.c4.s85">The doors opened again to let him through, and he re-settled himself on his chair.</s> <s sid="86" id="cuckoo.c4.s86">"As I was saying," he went on, "nothing could be easier.</s> <s sid="87" id="cuckoo.c4.s87">But that palace, as you call it, has an entrance on the other side, as well as the one you know."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="cuckoo.c4.p44"><s sid="88" id="cuckoo.c4.s88">"Another door, do you mean?" said Griselda.</s> <s sid="89" id="cuckoo.c4.s89">"How funny!</s> <s sid="90" id="cuckoo.c4.s90">Does it go through the wall?</s> <s sid="91" id="cuckoo.c4.s91">And where does it lead to?"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="cuckoo.c4.p45"><s sid="92" id="cuckoo.c4.s92">"It leads," replied the cuckoo, "it leads to the country of the Nodding Mandarins."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="cuckoo.c4.p46"><s sid="93" id="cuckoo.c4.s93">"_What_ fun!" exclaimed Griselda, clapping her hands.</s> <s sid="94" id="cuckoo.c4.s94">"Cuckoo, do let us go there.</s> <s sid="95" id="cuckoo.c4.s95">How can we get down?</s> <s sid="96" id="cuckoo.c4.s96">You can fly, but must I slide down the chain again?"</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="cuckoo.c4.p47"><s sid="97" id="cuckoo.c4.s97">"Oh dear, no," said the cuckoo, "by no means.</s> <s sid="98" id="cuckoo.c4.s98">You have only to stretch out your feather mantle, flap it as if it was wings--so"--he flapped his own wings encouragingly--"wish, and there you'll be."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="cuckoo.c4.p48"><s sid="99" id="cuckoo.c4.s99">"Where?" said Griselda bewilderedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="cuckoo.c4.p49"><s sid="100" id="cuckoo.c4.s100">"Wherever you wish to be, of course," said the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="101" id="cuckoo.c4.s101">"Are you ready?</s> <s sid="102" id="cuckoo.c4.s102">Here goes."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="cuckoo.c4.p50"><s sid="103" id="cuckoo.c4.s103">"Wait--wait a moment," cried Griselda.</s> <s sid="104" id="cuckoo.c4.s104">"Where am I to wish to be?"</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="cuckoo.c4.p51"><s sid="105" id="cuckoo.c4.s105">"Bless the child!" exclaimed the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="106" id="cuckoo.c4.s106">"Where _do_ you wish to be?</s> <s sid="107" id="cuckoo.c4.s107">You said you wanted to visit the country of the Nodding Mandarins."</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="cuckoo.c4.p52"><s sid="108" id="cuckoo.c4.s108">"Yes; but am I to wish first to be in the palace in the great saloon?"</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="cuckoo.c4.p53"><s sid="109" id="cuckoo.c4.s109">"Certainly," replied the cuckoo.</s> <s sid="110" id="cuckoo.c4.s110">"That is the entrance to Mandarin Land, and you said you would like to see through it.</s> <s sid="111" id="cuckoo.c4.s111">So--you're surely ready now?"</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="cuckoo.c4.p54"><s sid="112" id="cuckoo.c4.s112">"A thought has just struck me," said Griselda.</s> <s sid="113" id="cuckoo.c4.s113">"How will you know what o'clock it is, so as to come back in time to tell the next hour?</s> <s sid="114" id="cuckoo.c4.s114">My aunts will get into such a fright if you go wrong again!</s> <s sid="115" id="cuckoo.c4.s115">Are you sure we shall have time to go to the mandarins' country to-night?"</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cuckoo.c8.p5"><s sid="6" id="cuckoo.c8.s6">And Griselda became gradually more and more convinced that the only way as yet discovered of getting through hard tasks is to set to work and do them; also, that grumbling, as things are at present arranged in this world, does not _always_, nor I may say _often_, do good; furthermore, that an ill-tempered child is not, on the whole, likely to be as much loved as a good-tempered one; lastly, that if you wait long enough, winter will go and spring will come.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cuckoo.c8.p6"><s sid="7" id="cuckoo.c8.s7">For this was the case this year, after all!</s> <s sid="8" id="cuckoo.c8.s8">Spring had only been sleepy and lazy, and in such a case what could poor old winter do but fill the vacant post till she came?</s> <s sid="9" id="cuckoo.c8.s9">Why he should be so scolded and reviled for faithfully doing his best, as he often is, I really don't know.</s> <s sid="10" id="cuckoo.c8.s10">Not that all the ill words he gets have much effect on him--he comes again just as usual, whatever we say of or to him.</s> <s sid="11" id="cuckoo.c8.s11">I suppose his feelings have long ago been frozen up, or surely before this he would have taken offence--well for us that he has not done so!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cuckoo.c8.p7"><s sid="12" id="cuckoo.c8.s12">But when the spring did come at last this year, it would be impossible for me to tell you how Griselda enjoyed it.</s> <s sid="13" id="cuckoo.c8.s13">It was like new life to her as well as to the plants, and flowers, and birds, and insects.</s> <s sid="14" id="cuckoo.c8.s14">Hitherto, you see, she had been able to see very little of the outside of her aunt's house; and charming as the inside was, the outside, I must say, was still "charminger."</s> <s sid="15" id="cuckoo.c8.s15">There seemed no end to the little up-and-down paths and alleys, leading to rustic seats and quaint arbours; no limits to the little pine-wood, down into which led the dearest little zig-zaggy path you ever saw, all bordered with snow-drops and primroses and violets, and later on with periwinkles, and wood anemones, and those bright, starry, white flowers, whose name no two people agree about.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cuckoo.c8.p8"><s sid="16" id="cuckoo.c8.s16">This wood-path was the place, I think, which Griselda loved the best.</s> <s sid="17" id="cuckoo.c8.s17">The bowling-green was certainly very delightful, and so was the terrace where the famous roses grew; but lovely as the roses were (I am speaking just now, of course, of later on in the summer, when they were all in bloom), Griselda could not enjoy them as much as the wild-flowers, for she was forbidden to gather or touch them, except with her funny round nose!</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cuckoo.c8.p9"><s sid="18" id="cuckoo.c8.s18">"You may _scent_ them, my dear," said Miss Grizzel, who was of opinion that smell was not a pretty word; "but I cannot allow anything more."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cuckoo.c8.p10"><s sid="19" id="cuckoo.c8.s19">And Griselda did "scent" them, I assure you.</s> <s sid="20" id="cuckoo.c8.s20">She burrowed her whole rosy face in the big ones; but gently, for she did not want to spoil them, both for her aunt's sake, and because, too, she had a greater regard for flowers now that she knew the secret of how they were painted, and what a great deal of trouble the butterflies take about them.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cuckoo.c8.p11"><s sid="21" id="cuckoo.c8.s21">But after a while one grows tired of "scenting" roses; and even the trying to walk straight across the bowling-green with her eyes shut, from the arbour at one side to the arbour exactly like it at the other, grew stupid, though no doubt it would have been capital fun with a companion to applaud or criticize.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cuckoo.c8.p14"><s sid="27" id="cuckoo.c8.s27">But, failing companions, she did the best she could for herself, and this was why she loved the path down into the wood so much.</s> <s sid="28" id="cuckoo.c8.s28">There was a sort of mystery about it; it might have been the path leading to the cottage of Red-Ridinghood's grandmother, or a path leading to fairyland itself.</s> <s sid="29" id="cuckoo.c8.s29">There were all kinds of queer, nice, funny noises to be heard there--in one part of it especially, where Griselda made herself a seat of some moss-grown stones, and where she came so often that she got to know all the little flowers growing close round about, and even the particular birds whose nests were hard by.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cuckoo.c8.p15"><s sid="30" id="cuckoo.c8.s30">She used to sit there and _fancy_--fancy that she heard the wood-elves chattering under their breath, or the little underground gnomes and kobolds hammering at their fairy forges.</s> <s sid="31" id="cuckoo.c8.s31">And the tinkling of the brook in the distance sounded like the enchanted bells round the necks of the fairy kine, who are sent out to pasture sometimes on the upper world hill-sides.</s> <s sid="32" id="cuckoo.c8.s32">For Griselda's head was crammed full, perfectly full, of fairy lore; and the mandarins' country, and butterfly-land, were quite as real to her as the every-day world about her.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cuckoo.c8.p16"><s sid="33" id="cuckoo.c8.s33">But all this time she was not forgotten by the cuckoo, as you will see.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cuckoo.c8.p17"><s sid="34" id="cuckoo.c8.s34">One day she was sitting in her favourite nest, feeling, notwithstanding the sunshine, and the flowers, and the soft sweet air, and the pleasant sounds all about, rather dull and lonely.</s> <s sid="35" id="cuckoo.c8.s35">For though it was only May, it was really quite a hot day, and Griselda had been all the morning at her lessons, and had tried very hard, and done them very well, and now she felt as if she deserved some reward.</s> <s sid="36" id="cuckoo.c8.s36">Suddenly in the distance, she heard a well-known sound, "Cuckoo, cuckoo."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cuckoo.c8.p18"><s sid="37" id="cuckoo.c8.s37">"Can that be the cuckoo?" she said to herself; and in a moment she felt sure that it must be.</s> <s sid="38" id="cuckoo.c8.s38">For, for some reason that I do not know enough about the habits of real "flesh and blood" cuckoos to explain, that bird was not known in the neighbourhood where Griselda's aunts lived.</s> <s sid="39" id="cuckoo.c8.s39">Some twenty miles or so further south it was heard regularly, but all this spring Griselda had never caught the sound of its familiar note, and she now remembered hearing it never came to these parts.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cuckoo.c8.p19"><s sid="40" id="cuckoo.c8.s40">So, "it must be my cuckoo," she said to herself.</s> <s sid="41" id="cuckoo.c8.s41">"He must be coming out to speak to me.</s> <s sid="42" id="cuckoo.c8.s42">How funny!</s> <s sid="43" id="cuckoo.c8.s43">I have never seen him by daylight."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cuckoo.c8.p24"><s sid="52" id="cuckoo.c8.s52">The tears came into her eyes, and she was beginning to think herself very badly used, when suddenly a rustling in the bushes beside her made her turn round, more than half expecting to see the cuckoo himself.</s> <s sid="53" id="cuckoo.c8.s53">But it was not he.</s> <s sid="54" id="cuckoo.c8.s54">The rustling went on for a minute or two without anything making its appearance, for the bushes were pretty thick just there, and any one scrambling up from the pinewood below would have had rather hard work to get through, and indeed for a very big person such a feat would have been altogether impossible.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cuckoo.c8.p25"><s sid="55" id="cuckoo.c8.s55">It was not a very big person, however, who was causing all the rustling, and crunching of branches, and general commotion, which now absorbed Griselda's attention.</s> <s sid="56" id="cuckoo.c8.s56">She sat watching for another minute in perfect stillness, afraid of startling by the slightest movement the squirrel or rabbit or creature of some kind which she expected to see.</s> <s sid="57" id="cuckoo.c8.s57">At last--was that a squirrel or rabbit--that rosy, round face, with shaggy, fair hair falling over the eager blue eyes, and a general look of breathlessness and over-heatedness and determination?</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cuckoo.c11.p9"><s sid="26" id="cuckoo.c11.s26">"That's right, missie," said Dorcas approvingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cuckoo.c11.p10"><s sid="27" id="cuckoo.c11.s27">"It seems to me, Dorcas," said Griselda dreamily, when, a few minutes later, she was standing by the window while the old servant brushed out her thick, wavy hair, "it seems to me, Dorcas, that it's _all_ 'obeying orders' together.</s> <s sid="28" id="cuckoo.c11.s28">There's the sun now, just getting up, and the moon just going to bed--_they_ are always obeying, aren't they?</s> <s sid="29" id="cuckoo.c11.s29">I wonder why it should be so hard for people--for children, at least."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cuckoo.c11.p15"><s sid="40" id="cuckoo.c11.s40">Lessons _were_ very well done that day, and Mr. Kneebreeches' report was all that could be wished.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cuckoo.c11.p16"><s sid="41" id="cuckoo.c11.s41">"I am particularly gratified," he remarked to Miss Grizzel, "by the intelligence and interest Miss Griselda displays with regard to the study of astronomy, which I have recently begun to give her some elementary instruction in.</s> <s sid="42" id="cuckoo.c11.s42">And, indeed, I have no fault to find with the way in which any of the young lady's tasks are performed."</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cuckoo.c11.p17"><s sid="43" id="cuckoo.c11.s43">"I am extremely glad to hear it," replied Miss Grizzel graciously, and the kiss with which she answered Griselda's request for forgiveness was a very hearty one.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cuckoo.c11.p18"><s sid="44" id="cuckoo.c11.s44">And it was "all right" about Phil.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cuckoo.c11.p19"><s sid="45" id="cuckoo.c11.s45">Lady Lavander knew all about him; his father and mother were friends of hers, for whom she had a great regard, and for some time she had been intending to ask the little boy to spend the day at Merrybrow Hall, to be introduced to her god-daughter Griselda.</s> <s sid="46" id="cuckoo.c11.s46">So, _of course_, as Lady Lavander knew all about him, there could be no objection to his playing in Miss Grizzel's garden!</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cuckoo.c11.p22"><s sid="51" id="cuckoo.c11.s51">"No," said Phil mysteriously, "I didn't mind.</s> <s sid="52" id="cuckoo.c11.s52">I was looking for the way to fairyland to show you, and I do believe I've found it.</s> <s sid="53" id="cuckoo.c11.s53">Oh, it _is_ such a pretty way."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cuckoo.c11.p23"><s sid="54" id="cuckoo.c11.s54">Griselda smiled.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cuckoo.c11.p24"><s sid="55" id="cuckoo.c11.s55">"I'm afraid the way to fairyland isn't so easily found," she said.</s> <s sid="56" id="cuckoo.c11.s56">"But I'd like to hear about where you went.</s> <s sid="57" id="cuckoo.c11.s57">Was it far?"</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cuckoo.c11.p25"><s sid="58" id="cuckoo.c11.s58">"A good way," said Phil.</s> <s sid="59" id="cuckoo.c11.s59">"Won't you come with me?</s> <s sid="60" id="cuckoo.c11.s60">It's in the wood.</s> <s sid="61" id="cuckoo.c11.s61">I can show you quite well, and we can be back by tea-time."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cuckoo.c11.p26"><s sid="62" id="cuckoo.c11.s62">"Very well," said Griselda; and off they set.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cuckoo.c11.p27"><s sid="63" id="cuckoo.c11.s63">Whether it was the way to fairyland or not, it was not to be wondered at that little Phil thought so.</s> <s sid="64" id="cuckoo.c11.s64">He led Griselda right across the wood to a part where she had never been before.</s> <s sid="65" id="cuckoo.c11.s65">It was pretty rough work part of the way.</s> <s sid="66" id="cuckoo.c11.s66">The children had to fight with brambles and bushes, and here and there to creep through on hands and knees, and Griselda had to remind Phil several times of her promise to his nurse that his clothes should not be the worse for his playing with her, to prevent his scrambling through "anyhow" and leaving bits of his knickerbockers behind him.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="cuckoo.c11.p28"><s sid="67" id="cuckoo.c11.s67">But when at last they reached Phil's favourite spot all their troubles were forgotten.</s> <s sid="68" id="cuckoo.c11.s68">Oh, how pretty it was!</s> <s sid="69" id="cuckoo.c11.s69">It was a sort of tiny glade in the very middle of the wood--a little green nest enclosed all round by trees, and right through it the merry brook came rippling along as if rejoicing at getting out into the sunlight again for a while.</s> <s sid="70" id="cuckoo.c11.s70">And all the choicest and sweetest of the early summer flowers seemed to be collected here in greater variety and profusion than in any other part of the wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="cuckoo.c11.p29"><s sid="71" id="cuckoo.c11.s71">"_Isn't_ it nice?" said Phil, as he nestled down beside Griselda on the soft, mossy grass.</s> <s sid="72" id="cuckoo.c11.s72">"It must have been a fairies' garden some time, I'm sure, and I shouldn't wonder if one of the doors into fairyland is hidden somewhere here, if only we could find it."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cuckoo.c11.p30"><s sid="73" id="cuckoo.c11.s73">"If only!" said Griselda.</s> <s sid="74" id="cuckoo.c11.s74">"I don't think we shall find it, Phil; but, any way, this is a lovely place you've found, and I'd like to come here very often."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="cuckoo.c11.p31"><s sid="75" id="cuckoo.c11.s75">Then at Phil's suggestion they set to work to make themselves a house in the centre of this fairies' garden, as he called it.</s> <s sid="76" id="cuckoo.c11.s76">They managed it very much to their own satisfaction, by dragging some logs of wood and big stones from among the brushwood hard by, and filling the holes up with bracken and furze.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="cuckoo.c11.p32"><s sid="77" id="cuckoo.c11.s77">"And if the fairies _do_ come here," said Phil, "they'll be very pleased to find a house all ready, won't they?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="cuckoo.c11.p33"><s sid="78" id="cuckoo.c11.s78">Then they had to gather flowers to ornament the house inside, and dry leaves and twigs all ready for a fire in one corner.</s> <s sid="79" id="cuckoo.c11.s79">Altogether it was quite a business, I can assure you, and when it was finished they were very hot and very tired and _rather_ dirty.</s> <s sid="80" id="cuckoo.c11.s80">Suddenly a thought struck Griselda.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="cuckoo.c11.p34"><s sid="81" id="cuckoo.c11.s81">"Phil," she said, "it must be getting late."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="cuckoo.c11.p35"><s sid="82" id="cuckoo.c11.s82">"Past tea-time?" he said coolly.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="cuckoo.c11.p37"><s sid="87" id="cuckoo.c11.s87">"Here," said Phil, diving at a little opening among the bushes.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="cuckoo.c11.p38"><s sid="88" id="cuckoo.c11.s88">Griselda followed him.</s> <s sid="89" id="cuckoo.c11.s89">He had been a good guide hitherto, and she certainly could not have found her way alone.</s> <s sid="90" id="cuckoo.c11.s90">They scrambled on for some way, then the bushes suddenly seemed to grow less thick, and in a minute they came out upon a little path.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="cuckoo.c11.p39"><s sid="91" id="cuckoo.c11.s91">"Phil," said Griselda, "this isn't the way we came."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="cuckoo.c11.p40"><s sid="92" id="cuckoo.c11.s92">"Isn't it?" said Phil, looking about him.</s> <s sid="93" id="cuckoo.c11.s93">"Then we must have comed the wrong way."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="cuckoo.c11.p41"><s sid="94" id="cuckoo.c11.s94">"I'm afraid so," said Griselda, "and it seems to be so late already.</s> <s sid="95" id="cuckoo.c11.s95">I'm so sorry, for Aunt Grizzel will be vexed, and I did so want to please her.</s> <s sid="96" id="cuckoo.c11.s96">Will your nurse be vexed, Phil?"</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="cuckoo.c11.p42"><s sid="97" id="cuckoo.c11.s97">"I don't care if she are," replied Phil valiantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="cuckoo.c11.p45"><s sid="104" id="cuckoo.c11.s104">"She wouldn't like you to be out so late, I'm sure," said Griselda in distress, "and it's most my fault, for I'm the biggest.</s> <s sid="105" id="cuckoo.c11.s105">Now, which way _shall_ we go?"</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="cuckoo.c11.p46"><s sid="106" id="cuckoo.c11.s106">They had followed the little path till it came to a point where two roads, rough cart-ruts only, met; or, rather, where the path ran across the road.</s> <s sid="107" id="cuckoo.c11.s107">Right, or left, or straight on, which should it be?</s> <s sid="108" id="cuckoo.c11.s108">Griselda stood still in perplexity.</s> <s sid="109" id="cuckoo.c11.s109">Already it was growing dusk; already the moon's soft light was beginning faintly to glimmer through the branches.</s> <s sid="110" id="cuckoo.c11.s110">Griselda looked up to the sky.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="cuckoo.c11.p55"><s sid="124" id="cuckoo.c11.s124">"I know the way now, good cuckoo," exclaimed Phil.</s> <s sid="125" id="cuckoo.c11.s125">"I can go home alone now, if your aunt will be vexed with you."</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="cuckoo.c11.p56"><s sid="126" id="cuckoo.c11.s126">"No," said Griselda, "I must take you quite all the way home, Phil dear.</s> <s sid="127" id="cuckoo.c11.s127">I promised to take care of you, and if nurse scolds any one it must be me, not you."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="cuckoo.c11.p57"><s sid="128" id="cuckoo.c11.s128">There was a little bustle about the door of the farmhouse as the children wearily came up to it.</s> <s sid="129" id="cuckoo.c11.s129">Two or three men were standing together receiving directions from Mr. Crouch himself, and Phil's nurse was talking eagerly.</s> <s sid="130" id="cuckoo.c11.s130">Suddenly she caught sight of the truants.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="cuckoo.c11.p58"><s sid="131" id="cuckoo.c11.s131">"Here he is, Mr. Crouch!" she exclaimed.</s> <s sid="132" id="cuckoo.c11.s132">"No need now to send to look for him.</s> <s sid="133" id="cuckoo.c11.s133">Oh, Master Phil, how could you stay out so late?</s> <s sid="134" id="cuckoo.c11.s134">And to-night of all nights, just when your--I forgot, I mustn't say.</s> <s sid="135" id="cuckoo.c11.s135">Come in to the parlour at once--and this little girl, who is she?"</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="cuckoo.c11.p59"><s sid="136" id="cuckoo.c11.s136">"She isn't a little girl, she's a young lady," said Master Phil, putting on his lordly air, "and she's to come into the parlour and have some supper with me, and then some one must take her home to her auntie's house--that's what I say."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="cuckoo.c11.p60"><s sid="137" id="cuckoo.c11.s137">More to please Phil than from any wish for "supper," for she was really in a fidget to get home, Griselda let the little boy lead her into the parlour.</s> <s sid="138" id="cuckoo.c11.s138">But she was for a moment perfectly startled by the cry that broke from him when he opened the door and looked into the room.</s> <s sid="139" id="cuckoo.c11.s139">A lady was standing there, gazing out of the window, though in the quickly growing darkness she could hardly have distinguished the little figure she was watching for so anxiously.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="cuckoo.c11.p61"><s sid="140" id="cuckoo.c11.s140">The noise of the door opening made her look round.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="cuckoo.c11.p62"><s sid="141" id="cuckoo.c11.s141">"Phil," she cried, "my own little Phil; where have you been to?</s> <s sid="142" id="cuckoo.c11.s142">You didn't know I was waiting here for you, did you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="cuckoo.c11.p63"><s sid="143" id="cuckoo.c11.s143">"Mother, mother!" shouted Phil, darting into his mother's arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="cuckoo.c11.p64"><s sid="144" id="cuckoo.c11.s144">But Griselda drew back into the shadow of the doorway, and tears filled her eyes as for a minute or two she listened to the cooings and caressings of the mother and son.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="cuckoo.c11.p65"><s sid="145" id="cuckoo.c11.s145">Only for a minute, however.</s> <s sid="146" id="cuckoo.c11.s146">Then Phil called to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="cuckoo.c11.p66"><s sid="147" id="cuckoo.c11.s147">"Mother, mother," he cried again, "you must kiss Griselda, too!</s> <s sid="148" id="cuckoo.c11.s148">She's the little girl that is so kind, and plays with me; and she has no mother," he added in a lower tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="cuckoo.c11.p67"><s sid="149" id="cuckoo.c11.s149">The lady put her arm round Griselda, and kissed her, too.</s> <s sid="150" id="cuckoo.c11.s150">She did not seem surprised.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="cuckoo.c11.p68"><s sid="151" id="cuckoo.c11.s151">"I think I know about Griselda," she said very kindly, looking into her face with her gentle eyes, blue and clear like Phil's.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="cuckoo.c11.p69"><s sid="152" id="cuckoo.c11.s152">And then Griselda found courage to say how uneasy she was about the anxiety her aunts would be feeling, and a messenger was sent off at once to tell of her being safe at the farm.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="cuckoo.c11.p70"><s sid="153" id="cuckoo.c11.s153">But Griselda herself the kind lady would not let go till she had had some nice supper with Phil, and was both warmed and rested.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="cuckoo.c11.p71"><s sid="154" id="cuckoo.c11.s154">"And what were you about, children, to lose your way?" she asked presently.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="cuckoo.c11.p72"><s sid="155" id="cuckoo.c11.s155">"I took Griselda to see a place that I thought was the way to fairyland, and then we stayed to build a house for the fairies, in case they come, and then we came out at the wrong side, and it got dark," explained Phil.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="cuckoo.c11.p73"><s sid="156" id="cuckoo.c11.s156">"And _was_ it the way to fairyland?" asked his mother, smiling.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="cuckoo.c11.p75"><s sid="158" id="cuckoo.c11.s158">"Phil doesn't understand yet," she said gently.</s> <s sid="159" id="cuckoo.c11.s159">"He isn't old enough.</s> <s sid="160" id="cuckoo.c11.s160">The way to the true fairyland is hard to find, and we must each find it for ourselves, mustn't we?"</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="cuckoo.c11.p76"><s sid="161" id="cuckoo.c11.s161">She looked up in the lady's face as she spoke, and saw that _she_ understood.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="cuckoo.c11.p77"><s sid="162" id="cuckoo.c11.s162">"Yes, dear child," she answered softly, and perhaps a very little sadly.</s> <s sid="163" id="cuckoo.c11.s163">"But Phil and you may help each other, and I perhaps may help you both."</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="cuckoo.c11.p78"><s sid="164" id="cuckoo.c11.s164">Griselda slid her hand into the lady's.</s> <s sid="165" id="cuckoo.c11.s165">"You're not going to take Phil away, are you?" she whispered.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="cuckoo.c11.p79"><s sid="166" id="cuckoo.c11.s166">"No, I have come to stay here," she answered, "and Phil's father is coming too, soon.</s> <s sid="167" id="cuckoo.c11.s167">We are going to live at the White House--the house on the other side of the wood, on the way to Merrybrow.</s> <s sid="168" id="cuckoo.c11.s168">Are you glad, children?"</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="cuckoo.c11.p80"><s sid="169" id="cuckoo.c11.s169">*       *       *       *       *</s> </p>
