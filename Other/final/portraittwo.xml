<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c4.s1">Isabel came back to Florence, but only after several months; an interval sufficiently replete with incident.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c4.s2">It is not, however, during this interval that we are closely concerned with her; our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late spring-time, shortly after her return to Palazzo Crescentini and a year from the date of the incidents just narrated.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c4.s3">She was alone on this occasion, in one of the smaller of the numerous rooms devoted by Mrs. Touchett to social uses, and there was that in her expression and attitude which would have suggested that she was expecting a visitor.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c4.s4">The tall window was open, and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth and perfume.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c4.s5">Our young woman stood near it for some time, her hands clasped behind her; she gazed abroad with the vagueness of unrest.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c4.s6">Too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c4.s7">Yet it could not be in her thought to catch a glimpse of her visitor before he should pass into the house, since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden, in which stillness and privacy always reigned.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c4.s8">She wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture, and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c4.s9">Grave she found herself, and positively more weighted, as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c4.s10">She had ranged, she would have said, through space and surveyed much of mankind, and was therefore now, in her own eyes, a very different person from the frivolous young woman from Albany who had begun to take the measure of Europe on the lawn at Gardencourt a couple of years before.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c4.s11">She flattered herself she had harvested wisdom and learned a great deal more of life than this light-minded creature had even suspected.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c4.s12">If her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect, instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present, they would have evoked a multitude of interesting pictures.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c4.s13">These pictures would have been both landscapes and figure-pieces; the latter, however, would have been the more numerous.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c4.s14">With several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c4.s15">There would be for instance the conciliatory Lily, our heroine's sister and Edmund Ludlow's wife, who had come out from New York to spend five months with her relative.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c4.s16">She had left her husband behind her, but had brought her children, to whom Isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maiden-aunt.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c4.s17">Mr. Ludlow, toward the last, had been able to snatch a few weeks from his forensic triumphs and, crossing the ocean with extreme rapidity, had spent a month with the two ladies in Paris before taking his wife home.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c4.s18">The little Ludlows had not yet, even from the American point of view, reached the proper tourist-age; so that while her sister was with her Isabel had confined her movements to a narrow circle.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c4.s19">Lily and the babies had joined her in Switzerland in the month of July, and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an Alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows and the shade of great chestnuts made a resting-place for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons.</s> <s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c4.s20">They had afterwards reached the French capital, which was worshipped, and with costly ceremonies, by Lily, but thought of as noisily vacant by Isabel, who in these days made use of her memory of Rome as she might have done, in a hot and crowded room, of a phial of something pungent hidden in her handkerchief.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraittwo.c4.p2"><s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c4.s21">Mrs. Ludlow sacrificed, as I say, to Paris, yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar; and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c4.s22">They all had Isabel for subject; but Edmund Ludlow, as he had always done before, declined to be surprised, or distressed, or mystified, or elated, at anything his sister-in-law might have done or have failed to do.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c4.s23">Mrs. Ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently various.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c4.s24">At one moment she thought it would be so natural for that young woman to come home and take a house in New York--the Rossiters', for instance, which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own; at another she couldn't conceal her surprise at the girl's not marrying some member of one of the great aristocracies.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c4.s25">On the whole, as I have said, she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c4.s26">She had taken more satisfaction in Isabel's accession of fortune than if the money had been left to herself; it had seemed to her to offer just the proper setting for her sister's slightly meagre, but scarce the less eminent figure.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c4.s27">Isabel had developed less, however, than Lily had thought likely--development, to Lily's understanding, being somehow mysteriously connected with morning-calls and evening-parties.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c4.s28">Intellectually, doubtless, she had made immense strides; but she appeared to have achieved few of those social conquests of which Mrs. Ludlow had expected to admire the trophies.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraittwo.c4.s29">Lily's conception of such achievements was extremely vague; but this was exactly what she had expected of Isabel--to give it form and body.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraittwo.c4.s30">Isabel could have done as well as she had done in New York; and Mrs. Ludlow appealed to her husband to know whether there was any privilege she enjoyed in Europe which the society of that city might not offer her.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraittwo.c4.s31">We know ourselves that Isabel had made conquests--whether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land it would be a delicate matter to decide; and it is not altogether with a feeling of complacency that I again mention that she had not rendered these honourable victories public.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraittwo.c4.s32">She had not told her sister the history of Lord Warburton, nor had she given her a hint of Mr. Osmond's state of mind; and she had had no better reason for her silence than that she didn't wish to speak.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraittwo.c4.s33">It was more romantic to say nothing, and, drinking deep, in secret, of romance, she was as little disposed to ask poor Lily's advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraittwo.c4.s34">But Lily knew nothing of these discriminations, and could only pronounce her sister's career a strange anti-climax--an impression confirmed by the fact that Isabel's silence about Mr. Osmond, for instance, was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraittwo.c4.s35">As this happened very often it sometimes appeared to Mrs. Ludlow that she had lost her courage.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraittwo.c4.s36">So uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune was of course perplexing to the cheerful Lily; it added to her general sense that Isabel was not at all like other people.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraittwo.c4.p3"><s sid="37" id="portraittwo.c4.s37">Our young lady's courage, however, might have been taken as reaching its height after her relations had gone home.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraittwo.c4.s38">She could imagine braver things than spending the winter in Paris--Paris had sides by which it so resembled New York, Paris was like smart, neat prose--and her close correspondence with Madame Merle did much to stimulate such flights.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraittwo.c4.s39">She had never had a keener sense of freedom, of the absolute boldness and wantonness of liberty, than when she turned away from the platform at the Euston Station on one of the last days of November, after the departure of the train that was to convey poor Lily, her husband and her children to their ship at Liverpool.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraittwo.c4.s40">It had been good for her to regale; she was very conscious of that; she was very observant, as we know, of what was good for her, and her effort was constantly to find something that was good enough.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraittwo.c4.s41">To profit by the present advantage till the latest moment she had made the journey from Paris with the unenvied travellers.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraittwo.c4.s42">She would have accompanied them to Liverpool as well, only Edmund Ludlow had asked her, as a favour, not to do so; it made Lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraittwo.c4.s43">Isabel watched the train move away; she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews, a demonstrative child who leaned dangerously far out of the window of the carriage and made separation an occasion of violent hilarity, and then she walked back into the foggy London street.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraittwo.c4.s44">The world lay before her--she could do whatever she chose.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraittwo.c4.s45">There was a deep thrill in it all, but for the present her choice was tolerably discreet; she chose simply to walk back from Euston Square to her hotel.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraittwo.c4.s46">The early dusk of a November afternoon had already closed in; the street-lamps, in the thick, brown air, looked weak and red; our heroine was unattended and Euston Square was a long way from Piccadilly.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraittwo.c4.s47">But Isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose, in order to get more sensations, so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily set her right again.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraittwo.c4.s48">She was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the London streets--the moving crowds, the hurrying cabs, the lighted shops, the flaring stalls, the dark, shining dampness of everything.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraittwo.c4.s49">That evening, at her hotel, she wrote to Madame Merle that she should start in a day or two for Rome.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraittwo.c4.s50">She made her way down to Rome without touching at Florence--having gone first to Venice and then proceeded southward by Ancona.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraittwo.c4.s51">She accomplished this journey without other assistance than that of her servant, for her natural protectors were not now on the ground.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraittwo.c4.s52">Ralph Touchett was spending the winter at Corfu, and Miss Stackpole, in the September previous, had been recalled to America by a telegram from the _Interviewer_.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraittwo.c4.s53">This journal offered its brilliant correspondent a fresher field for her genius than the mouldering cities of Europe, and Henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from Mr. Bantling that he would soon come over to see her.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraittwo.c4.s54">Isabel wrote to Mrs. Touchett to apologise for not presenting herself just yet in Florence, and her aunt replied characteristically enough.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraittwo.c4.s55">Apologies, Mrs. Touchett intimated, were of no more use to her than bubbles, and she herself never dealt in such articles.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraittwo.c4.s56">One either did the thing or one didn't, and what one "would" have done belonged to the sphere of the irrelevant, like the idea of a future life or of the origin of things.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraittwo.c4.s57">Her letter was frank, but (a rare case with Mrs. Touchett) not so frank as it pretended.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraittwo.c4.s58">She easily forgave her niece for not stopping at Florence, because she took it for a sign that Gilbert Osmond was less in question there than formerly.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraittwo.c4.s59">She watched of course to see if he would now find a pretext for going to Rome, and derived some comfort from learning that he had not been guilty of an absence.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraittwo.c4.s60">Isabel, on her side, had not been a fortnight in Rome before she proposed to Madame Merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the East.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraittwo.c4.s61">Madame Merle remarked that her friend was restless, but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit Athens and Constantinople.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraittwo.c4.s62">The two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition, and spent three months in Greece, in Turkey, in Egypt.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraittwo.c4.s63">Isabel found much to interest her in these countries, though Madame Merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites, the scenes most calculated to suggest repose and reflexion, a certain incoherence prevailed in her.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraittwo.c4.s64">Isabel travelled rapidly and recklessly; she was like a thirsty person draining cup after cup.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraittwo.c4.s65">Madame Merle meanwhile, as lady-in-waiting to a princess circulating _incognita_, panted a little in her rear.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraittwo.c4.s66">It was on Isabel's invitation she had come, and she imparted all due dignity to the girl's uncountenanced state.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraittwo.c4.s67">She played her part with the tact that might have been expected of her, effacing herself and accepting the position of a companion whose expenses were profusely paid.</s> <s sid="68" id="portraittwo.c4.s68">The situation, however, had no hardships, and people who met this reserved though striking pair on their travels would not have been able to tell you which was patroness and which client.</s> <s sid="69" id="portraittwo.c4.s69">To say that Madame Merle improved on acquaintance states meagrely the impression she made on her friend, who had found her from the first so ample and so easy.</s> <s sid="70" id="portraittwo.c4.s70">At the end of an intimacy of three months Isabel felt she knew her better; her character had revealed itself, and the admirable woman had also at last redeemed her promise of relating her history from her own point of view--a consummation the more desirable as Isabel had already heard it related from the point of view of others.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraittwo.c4.s71">This history was so sad a one (in so far as it concerned the late M. Merle, a positive adventurer, she might say, though originally so plausible, who had taken advantage, years before, of her youth and of an inexperience in which doubtless those who knew her only now would find it difficult to believe); it abounded so in startling and lamentable incidents that her companion wondered a person so _eprouvee_ could have kept so much of her freshness, her interest in life.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraittwo.c4.s72">Into this freshness of Madame Merle's she obtained a considerable insight; she seemed to see it as professional, as slightly mechanical, carried about in its case like the fiddle of the virtuoso, or blanketed and bridled like the "favourite" of the jockey.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraittwo.c4.s73">She liked her as much as ever, but there was a corner of the curtain that never was lifted; it was as if she had remained after all something of a public performer, condemned to emerge only in character and in costume.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraittwo.c4.s74">She had once said that she came from a distance, that she belonged to the "old, old" world, and Isabel never lost the impression that she was the product of a different moral or social clime from her own, that she had grown up under other stars.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraittwo.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="portraittwo.c4.s75">She believed then that at bottom she had a different morality.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraittwo.c4.s76">Of course the morality of civilised persons has always much in common; but our young woman had a sense in her of values gone wrong or, as they said at the shops, marked down.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraittwo.c4.s77">She considered, with the presumption of youth, that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it; and this conviction was an aid to detecting an occasional flash of cruelty, an occasional lapse from candour, in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception.</s> <s sid="78" id="portraittwo.c4.s78">Her conception of human motives might, in certain lights, have been acquired at the court of some kingdom in decadence, and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraittwo.c4.s79">She had not heard of everything, that was very plain; and there were evidently things in the world of which it was not advantageous to hear.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraittwo.c4.s80">She had once or twice had a positive scare; since it so affected her to have to exclaim, of her friend, <qs/>"Heaven forgive her, she doesn't understand me!"<qe/></s> <s sid="81" id="portraittwo.c4.s81">Absurd as it may seem this discovery operated as a shock, left her with a vague dismay in which there was even an element of foreboding.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraittwo.c4.s82">The dismay of course subsided, in the light of some sudden proof of Madame Merle's remarkable intelligence; but it stood for a high-water-mark in the ebb and flow of confidence.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraittwo.c4.s83">Madame Merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to decline--there being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraittwo.c4.s84">A stationary affection, in other words, was impossible--it must move one way or the other.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraittwo.c4.s85">However that might be, the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic, which was more active than it had ever been.</s> <s sid="86" id="portraittwo.c4.s86">I do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the Pyramids in the course of an excursion from Cairo, or as she stood among the broken columns of the Acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the Strait of Salamis; deep and memorable as these emotions had remained.</s> <s sid="87" id="portraittwo.c4.s87">She came back by the last of March from Egypt and Greece and made another stay in Rome.</s> <s sid="88" id="portraittwo.c4.s88">A few days after her arrival Gilbert Osmond descended from Florence and remained three weeks, during which the fact of her being with his old friend Madame Merle, in whose house she had gone to lodge, made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraittwo.c4.s89">When the last of April came she wrote to Mrs. Touchett that she should now rejoice to accept an invitation given long before, and went to pay a visit at Palazzo Crescentini, Madame Merle on this occasion remaining in Rome.</s> <s sid="90" id="portraittwo.c4.s90">She found her aunt alone; her cousin was still at Corfu.</s> <s sid="91" id="portraittwo.c4.s91">Ralph, however, was expected in Florence from day to day, and Isabel, who had not seen him for upwards of a year, was prepared to give him the most affectionate welcome.</s> </p>

it was upholstered in pale yellow; there were several lamps; through the open door it looked the very temple of authorised love.</s> <s sid="99" id="portraittwo.c10.s99">Rosier gazed a moment through this aperture;

and whereas of old she had a great delight in good-humoured argument, in intellectual play (she never looked so charming as when in the genial heat of discussion she received a crushing blow full in the face and brushed it away as a feather), she appeared now to think there was nothing worth people's either differing about or agreeing upon.</s> <s sid="70" id="portraittwo.c12.s70">Of old she had been curious, and now she was indifferent, and yet in spite of her indifference her activity was greater than ever.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraittwo.c12.s71">Slender still, but lovelier than before, she had gained no great maturity of aspect;

<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c13.s1">Isabel had not seen much of Madame Merle since her marriage, this lady having indulged in frequent absences from Rome.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c13.s2">At one time she had spent six months in England; at another she had passed a portion of a winter in Paris.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c13.s3">She had made numerous visits to distant friends and gave countenance to the idea that for the future she should be a less inveterate Roman than in the past.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c13.s4">As she had been inveterate in the past only in the sense of constantly having an apartment in one of the sunniest niches of the Pincian--an apartment which often stood empty--this suggested a prospect of almost constant absence; a danger which Isabel at one period had been much inclined to deplore.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c13.s5">Familiarity had modified in some degree her first impression of Madame Merle, but it had not essentially altered it; there was still much wonder of admiration in it.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c13.s6">That personage was armed at all points; it was a pleasure to see a character so completely equipped for the social battle.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c13.s7">She carried her flag discreetly, but her weapons were polished steel, and she used them with a skill which struck Isabel as more and more that of a veteran.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c13.s8">She was never weary, never overcome with disgust; she never appeared to need rest or consolation.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c13.s9">She had her own ideas; she had of old exposed a great many of them to Isabel, who knew also that under an appearance of extreme self-control her highly-cultivated friend concealed a rich sensibility.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c13.s10">But her will was mistress of her life; there was something gallant in the way she kept going.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c13.s11">It was as if she had learned the secret of it--as if the art of life were some clever trick she had guessed.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c13.s12">Isabel, as she herself grew older, became acquainted with revulsions, with disgusts; there were days when the world looked black and she asked herself with some sharpness what it was that she was pretending to live for.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c13.s13">Her old habit had been to live by enthusiasm, to fall in love with suddenly-perceived possibilities, with the idea of some new adventure.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c13.s14">As a younger person she had been used to proceed from one little exaltation to the other: there were scarcely any dull places between.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c13.s15">But Madame Merle had suppressed enthusiasm; she fell in love now-a-days with nothing; she lived entirely by reason and by wisdom.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c13.s16">There were hours when Isabel would have given anything for lessons in this art; if her brilliant friend had been near she would have made an appeal to her.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c13.s17">She had become aware more than before of the advantage of being like that--of having made one's self a firm surface, a sort of corselet of silver.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="portraittwo.c13.p6" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="portraittwo.c13.s69">Madame Merle, in fact, had come back before it was too late--too late, I mean, to recover whatever advantage she might have lost.</s> <s sid="70" id="portraittwo.c13.s70">But meantime, if, as I have said, she was sensibly different, Isabel's feelings were also not quite the same.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraittwo.c13.s71">Her consciousness of the situation was as acute as of old, but it was much less satisfying.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraittwo.c13.s72">A dissatisfied mind, whatever else it may miss, is rarely in want of reasons; they bloom as thick as buttercups in June.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraittwo.c13.s73">The fact of Madame Merle's having had a hand in Gilbert Osmond's marriage ceased to be one of her titles to consideration; it might have been written, after all, that there was not so much to thank her for.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraittwo.c13.s74">As time went on there was less and less, and Isabel once said to herself that perhaps without her these things would not have been.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraittwo.c13.s75">That reflection indeed was instantly stifled; she knew an immediate horror at having made it.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraittwo.c13.s76"><qs/>"Whatever happens to me let me not be unjust,"<qe/><sss/> she said; <sse/><qs/>"let me bear my burdens myself and not shift them upon others!"<qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="portraittwo.c13.s77">This disposition was tested, eventually, by that ingenious apology for her present conduct which Madame Merle saw fit to make and of which I have given a sketch; for there was something irritating--there was almost an air of mockery--in her neat discriminations and clear convictions.</s> <s sid="78" id="portraittwo.c13.s78">In Isabel's mind to-day there was nothing clear; there was a confusion of regrets, a complication of fears.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraittwo.c13.s79">She felt helpless as she turned away from her friend, who had just made the statements I have quoted:</s> <s sid="80" id="portraittwo.c13.s80">Madame Merle knew so little what she was thinking of!</s> <s sid="81" id="portraittwo.c13.s81">She was herself moreover so unable to explain.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraittwo.c13.s82">Jealous of her--jealous of her with Gilbert?</s> <s sid="83" id="portraittwo.c13.s83">The idea just then suggested no near reality.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraittwo.c13.s84">She almost wished jealousy had been possible; it would have made in a manner for refreshment.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraittwo.c13.s85">Wasn't it in a manner one of the symptoms of happiness?</s> <s sid="86" id="portraittwo.c13.s86">Madame Merle, however, was wise, so wise that she might have been pretending to know Isabel better than Isabel knew herself.</s> <s sid="87" id="portraittwo.c13.s87">This young woman had always been fertile in resolutions--any of them of an elevated character; but at no period had they flourished (in the privacy of her heart) more richly than to-day.</s> <s sid="88" id="portraittwo.c13.s88">It is true that they all had a family likeness; they might have been summed up in the determination that if she was to be unhappy it should not be by a fault of her own.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraittwo.c13.s89">Her poor winged spirit had always had a great desire to do its best, and it had not as yet been seriously discouraged.</s> <s sid="90" id="portraittwo.c13.s90">It wished, therefore, to hold fast to justice--not to pay itself by petty revenges.</s> <s sid="91" id="portraittwo.c13.s91">To associate Madame Merle with its disappointment would be a petty revenge--especially as the pleasure to be derived from that would be perfectly insincere.</s> <s sid="92" id="portraittwo.c13.s92">It might feed her sense of bitterness, but it would not loosen her bonds.</s> <s sid="93" id="portraittwo.c13.s93">It was impossible to pretend that she had not acted with her eyes open; if ever a girl was a free agent she had been.</s> <s sid="94" id="portraittwo.c13.s94">A girl in love was doubtless not a free agent; but the sole source of her mistake had been within herself.</s> <s sid="95" id="portraittwo.c13.s95">There had been no plot, no snare; she had looked and considered and chosen.</s> <s sid="96" id="portraittwo.c13.s96">When a woman had made such a mistake, there was only one way to repair it--just immensely (oh, with the highest grandeur!) to accept it.</s> <s sid="97" id="portraittwo.c13.s97">One folly was enough, especially when it was to last for ever; a second one would not much set it off.</s> <s sid="98" id="portraittwo.c13.s98">In this vow of reticence there was a certain nobleness which kept Isabel going; but Madame Merle had been right, for all that, in taking her precautions.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="portraittwo.c13.p7"><s sid="99" id="portraittwo.c13.s99">One day about a month after Ralph Touchett's arrival in Rome Isabel came back from a walk with Pansy.</s> <s sid="100" id="portraittwo.c13.s100">It was not only a part of her general determination to be just that she was at present very thankful for Pansy--it was also a part of her tenderness for things that were pure and weak.</s> <s sid="101" id="portraittwo.c13.s101">Pansy was dear to her, and there was nothing else in her life that had the rightness of the young creature's attachment or the sweetness of her own clearness about it.</s> <s sid="102" id="portraittwo.c13.s102">It was like a soft presence--like a small hand in her own; on Pansy's part it was more than an affection--it was a kind of ardent coercive faith.</s> <s sid="103" id="portraittwo.c13.s103">On her own side her sense of the girl's dependence was more than a pleasure; it operated as a definite reason when motives threatened to fail her.</s> <s sid="104" id="portraittwo.c13.s104">She had said to herself that we must take our duty where we find it, and that we must look for it as much as possible.</s> <s sid="105" id="portraittwo.c13.s105">Pansy's sympathy was a direct admonition; it seemed to say that here was an opportunity, not eminent perhaps, but unmistakeable.</s> <s sid="106" id="portraittwo.c13.s106">Yet an opportunity for what Isabel could hardly have said; in general, to be more for the child than the child was able to be for herself.</s> <s sid="107" id="portraittwo.c13.s107">Isabel could have smiled, in these days, to remember that her little companion had once been ambiguous, for she now perceived that Pansy's ambiguities were simply her own grossness of vision.</s> <s sid="108" id="portraittwo.c13.s108">She had been unable to believe any one could care so much--so extraordinarily much--to please.</s> <s sid="109" id="portraittwo.c13.s109">But since then she had seen this delicate faculty in operation, and now she knew what to think of it.</s> <s sid="110" id="portraittwo.c13.s110">It was the whole creature--it was a sort of genius.</s> <s sid="111" id="portraittwo.c13.s111">Pansy had no pride to interfere with it, and though she was constantly extending her conquests she took no credit for them.</s> <s sid="112" id="portraittwo.c13.s112">The two were constantly together; Mrs. Osmond was rarely seen without her stepdaughter.</s> <s sid="113" id="portraittwo.c13.s113">Isabel liked her company; it had the effect of one's carrying a nosegay composed all of the same flower.</s> <s sid="114" id="portraittwo.c13.s114">And then not to neglect Pansy, not under any provocation to neglect her--this she had made an article of religion.</s> <s sid="115" id="portraittwo.c13.s115">The young girl had every appearance of being happier in Isabel's society than in that of any one save her father,--whom she admired with an intensity justified by the fact that, as paternity was an exquisite pleasure to Gilbert Osmond, he had always been luxuriously mild.</s> <s sid="116" id="portraittwo.c13.s116">Isabel knew how Pansy liked to be with her and how she studied the means of pleasing her.</s> <s sid="117" id="portraittwo.c13.s117">She had decided that the best way of pleasing her was negative, and consisted in not giving her trouble--a conviction which certainly could have had no reference to trouble already existing.</s> <s sid="118" id="portraittwo.c13.s118">She was therefore ingeniously passive and almost imaginatively docile;

<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c15.s1">She had answered nothing because his words had put the situation before her and she was absorbed in looking at it.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c15.s2">There was something in them that suddenly made vibrations deep, so that she had been afraid to trust herself to speak.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c15.s3">After he had gone she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes; and for a long time, far into the night and still further, she sat in the still drawing-room, given up to her meditation.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c15.s4">A servant came in to attend to the fire, and she bade him bring fresh candles and then go to bed.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c15.s5">Osmond had told her to think of what he had said; and she did so indeed, and of many other things.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c15.s6">The suggestion from another that she had a definite influence on Lord Warburton--this had given her the start that accompanies unexpected recognition.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c15.s7">Was it true that there was something still between them that might be a handle to make him declare himself to Pansy--a susceptibility, on his part, to approval, a desire to do what would please her?</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c15.s8">Isabel had hitherto not asked herself the question, because she had not been forced; but now that it was directly presented to her she saw the answer, and the answer frightened her.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c15.s9">Yes, there was something--something on Lord Warburton's part.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c15.s10">When he had first come to Rome she believed the link that united them to be completely snapped; but little by little she had been reminded that it had yet a palpable existence.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c15.s11">It was as thin as a hair, but there were moments when she seemed to hear it vibrate.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c15.s12">For herself nothing was changed; what she once thought of him she always thought; it was needless this feeling should change; it seemed to her in fact a better feeling than ever.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c15.s13">But he? had he still the idea that she might be more to him than other women?</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c15.s14">Had he the wish to profit by the memory of the few moments of intimacy through which they had once passed?</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c15.s15">Isabel knew she had read some of the signs of such a disposition.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c15.s16">But what were his hopes, his pretensions, and in what strange way were they mingled with his evidently very sincere appreciation of poor Pansy?</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c15.s17">Was he in love with Gilbert Osmond's wife, and if so what comfort did he expect to derive from it?</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c15.s18">If he was in love with Pansy he was not in love with her stepmother, and if he was in love with her stepmother he was not in love with Pansy.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c15.s19">Was she to cultivate the advantage she possessed in order to make him commit himself to Pansy, knowing he would do so for her sake and not for the small creature's own--was this the service her husband had asked of her?</s> <s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c15.s20">This at any rate was the duty with which she found herself confronted--from the moment she admitted to herself that her old friend had still an uneradicated predilection for her society.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c15.s21">It was not an agreeable task; it was in fact a repulsive one.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c15.s22">She asked herself with dismay whether Lord Warburton were pretending to be in love with Pansy in order to cultivate another satisfaction and what might be called other chances.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c15.s23">Of this refinement of duplicity she presently acquitted him; she preferred to believe him in perfect good faith.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c15.s24">But if his admiration for Pansy were a delusion this was scarcely better than its being an affectation.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c15.s25">Isabel wandered among these ugly possibilities until she had completely lost her way; some of them, as she suddenly encountered them, seemed ugly enough.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c15.s26">Then she broke out of the labyrinth, rubbing her eyes, and declared that her imagination surely did her little honour and that her husband's did him even less.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c15.s27">Lord Warburton was as disinterested as he need be, and she was no more to him than she need wish.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c15.s28">She would rest upon this till the contrary should be proved; proved more effectually than by a cynical intimation of Osmond's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraittwo.c15.p2"><s sid="29" id="portraittwo.c15.s29">Such a resolution, however, brought her this evening but little peace, for her soul was haunted with terrors which crowded to the foreground of thought as quickly as a place was made for them.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraittwo.c15.s30">What had suddenly set them into livelier motion she hardly knew, unless it were the strange impression she had received in the afternoon of her husband's being in more direct communication with Madame Merle than she suspected.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraittwo.c15.s31">That impression came back to her from time to time, and now she wondered it had never come before.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraittwo.c15.s32">Besides this, her short interview with Osmond half an hour ago was a striking example of his faculty for making everything wither that he touched, spoiling everything for her that he looked at.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraittwo.c15.s33">It was very well to undertake to give him a proof of loyalty; the real fact was that the knowledge of his expecting a thing raised a presumption against it.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraittwo.c15.s34">It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraittwo.c15.s35">Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him?</s> <s sid="36" id="portraittwo.c15.s36">This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraittwo.c15.s37">It was a strange opposition, of the like of which she had never dreamed--an opposition in which the vital principle of the one was a thing of contempt to the other.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraittwo.c15.s38">It was not her fault--she had practised no deception; she had only admired and believed.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraittwo.c15.s39">She had taken all the first steps in the purest confidence, and then she had suddenly found the infinite vista of a multiplied life to be a dark, narrow alley with a dead wall at the end.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraittwo.c15.s40">Instead of leading to the high places of happiness, from which the world would seem to lie below one, so that one could look down with a sense of exaltation and advantage, and judge and choose and pity, it led rather downward and earthward, into realms of restriction and depression where the sound of other lives, easier and freer, was heard as from above, and where it served to deepen the feeling of failure.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraittwo.c15.s41">It was her deep distrust of her husband--this was what darkened the world.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraittwo.c15.s42">That is a sentiment easily indicated, but not so easily explained, and so composite in its character that much time and still more suffering had been needed to bring it to its actual perfection.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraittwo.c15.s43">Suffering, with Isabel, was an active condition; it was not a chill, a stupor, a despair; it was a passion of thought, of speculation, of response to every pressure.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraittwo.c15.s44">She flattered herself that she had kept her failing faith to herself, however,--that no one suspected it but Osmond.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraittwo.c15.s45">Oh, he knew it, and there were times when she thought he enjoyed it.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraittwo.c15.s46">It had come gradually--it was not till the first year of their life together, so admirably intimate at first, had closed that she had taken the alarm.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraittwo.c15.s47">Then the shadows had begun to gather; it was as if Osmond deliberately, almost malignantly, had put the lights out one by one.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraittwo.c15.s48">The dusk at first was vague and thin, and she could still see her way in it.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraittwo.c15.s49">But it steadily deepened, and if now and again it had occasionally lifted there were certain corners of her prospect that were impenetrably black.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraittwo.c15.s50">These shadows were not an emanation from her own mind: she was very sure of that; she had done her best to be just and temperate, to see only the truth.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraittwo.c15.s51">They were a part, they were a kind of creation and consequence, of her husband's very presence.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraittwo.c15.s52">They were not his misdeeds, his turpitudes; she accused him of nothing--that is but of one thing, which was _not_ a crime.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraittwo.c15.s53">She knew of no wrong he had done; he was not violent, he was not cruel: she simply believed he hated her.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraittwo.c15.s54">That was all she accused him of, and the miserable part of it was precisely that it was not a crime, for against a crime she might have found redress.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraittwo.c15.s55">He had discovered that she was so different, that she was not what he had believed she would prove to be.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraittwo.c15.s56">He had thought at first he could change her, and she had done her best to be what he would like.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraittwo.c15.s57">But she was, after all, herself--she couldn't help that; and now there was no use pretending, wearing a mask or a dress, for he knew her and had made up his mind.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraittwo.c15.s58">She was not afraid of him; she had no apprehension he would hurt her; for the ill-will he bore her was not of that sort.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraittwo.c15.s59">He would if possible never give her a pretext, never put himself in the wrong.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraittwo.c15.s60">Isabel, scanning the future with dry, fixed eyes, saw that he would have the better of her there.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraittwo.c15.s61">She would give him many pretexts, she would often put herself in the wrong.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraittwo.c15.s62">There were times when she almost pitied him; for if she had not deceived him in intention she understood how completely she must have done so in fact.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraittwo.c15.s63">She had effaced herself when he first knew her; she had made herself small, pretending there was less of her than there really was.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraittwo.c15.s64">It was because she had been under the extraordinary charm that he, on his side, had taken pains to put forth.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraittwo.c15.s65">He was not changed; he had not disguised himself, during the year of his courtship, any more than she.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraittwo.c15.s66">But she had seen only half his nature then, as one saw the disk of the moon when it was partly masked by the shadow of the earth.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraittwo.c15.s67">She saw the full moon now--she saw the whole man.</s> <s sid="68" id="portraittwo.c15.s68">She had kept still, as it were, so that he should have a free field, and yet in spite of this she had mistaken a part for the whole.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraittwo.c15.p3"><s sid="69" id="portraittwo.c15.s69">Ah, she had been immensely under the charm!</s> <s sid="70" id="portraittwo.c15.s70">It had not passed away; it was there still: she still knew perfectly what it was that made Osmond delightful when he chose to be.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraittwo.c15.s71">He had wished to be when he made love to her, and as she had wished to be charmed it was not wonderful he had succeeded.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraittwo.c15.s72">He had succeeded because he had been sincere; it never occurred to her now to deny him that.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraittwo.c15.s73">He admired her--he had told her why: because she was the most imaginative woman he had known.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraittwo.c15.s74">It might very well have been true; for during those months she had imagined a world of things that had no substance.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraittwo.c15.s75">She had had a more wondrous vision of him, fed through charmed senses and oh such a stirred fancy!--she had not read him right.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraittwo.c15.s76">A certain combination of features had touched her, and in them she had seen the most striking of figures.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraittwo.c15.s77">That he was poor and lonely and yet that somehow he was noble--that was what had interested her and seemed to give her her opportunity.</s> <s sid="78" id="portraittwo.c15.s78">There had been an indefinable beauty about him--in his situation, in his mind, in his face.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraittwo.c15.s79">She had felt at the same time that he was helpless and ineffectual, but the feeling had taken the form of a tenderness which was the very flower of respect.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraittwo.c15.s80">He was like a sceptical voyager strolling on the beach while he waited for the tide, looking seaward yet not putting to sea.</s> <s sid="81" id="portraittwo.c15.s81">It was in all this she had found her occasion.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraittwo.c15.s82">She would launch his boat for him; she would be his providence; it would be a good thing to love him.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraittwo.c15.s83">And she had loved him, she had so anxiously and yet so ardently given herself--a good deal for what she found in him, but a good deal also for what she brought him and what might enrich the gift.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraittwo.c15.s84">As she looked back at the passion of those full weeks she perceived in it a kind of maternal strain--the happiness of a woman who felt that she was a contributor, that she came with charged hands.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraittwo.c15.s85">But for her money, as she saw to-day, she would never have done it.</s> <s sid="86" id="portraittwo.c15.s86">And then her mind wandered off to poor Mr. Touchett, sleeping under English turf, the beneficent author of infinite woe!</s> <s sid="87" id="portraittwo.c15.s87">For this was the fantastic fact.</s> <s sid="88" id="portraittwo.c15.s88">At bottom her money had been a burden, had been on her mind, which was filled with the desire to transfer the weight of it to some other conscience, to some more prepared receptacle.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraittwo.c15.s89">What would lighten her own conscience more effectually than to make it over to the man with the best taste in the world?</s> <s sid="90" id="portraittwo.c15.s90">Unless she should have given it to a hospital there would have been nothing better she could do with it; and there was no charitable institution in which she had been as much interested as in Gilbert Osmond.</s> <s sid="91" id="portraittwo.c15.s91">He would use her fortune in a way that would make her think better of it and rub off a certain grossness attaching to the good luck of an unexpected inheritance.</s> <s sid="92" id="portraittwo.c15.s92">There had been nothing very delicate in inheriting seventy thousand pounds; the delicacy had been all in Mr. Touchett's leaving them to her.</s> <s sid="93" id="portraittwo.c15.s93">But to marry Gilbert Osmond and bring him such a portion--in that there would be delicacy for her as well.</s> <s sid="94" id="portraittwo.c15.s94">There would be less for him--that was true; but that was his affair, and if he loved her he wouldn't object to her being rich.</s> <s sid="95" id="portraittwo.c15.s95">Had he not had the courage to say he was glad she was rich?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraittwo.c15.p4"><s sid="96" id="portraittwo.c15.s96">Isabel's cheek burned when she asked herself if she had really married on a factitious theory, in order to do something finely appreciable with her money.</s> <s sid="97" id="portraittwo.c15.s97">But she was able to answer quickly enough that this was only half the story.</s> <s sid="98" id="portraittwo.c15.s98">It was because a certain ardour took possession of her--a sense of the earnestness of his affection and a delight in his personal qualities.</s> <s sid="99" id="portraittwo.c15.s99">He was better than any one else.</s> <s sid="100" id="portraittwo.c15.s100">This supreme conviction had filled her life for months, and enough of it still remained to prove to her that she could not have done otherwise.</s> <s sid="101" id="portraittwo.c15.s101">The finest--in the sense of being the subtlest--manly organism she had ever known had become her property, and the recognition of her having but to put out her hands and take it had been originally a sort of act of devotion.</s> <s sid="102" id="portraittwo.c15.s102">She had not been mistaken about the beauty of his mind; she knew that organ perfectly now.</s> <s sid="103" id="portraittwo.c15.s103">She had lived with it, she had lived _in_ it almost--it appeared to have become her habitation.</s> <s sid="104" id="portraittwo.c15.s104">If she had been captured it had taken a firm hand to seize her; that reflection perhaps had some worth.</s> <s sid="105" id="portraittwo.c15.s105">A mind more ingenious, more pliant, more cultivated, more trained to admirable exercises, she had not encountered; and it was this exquisite instrument she had now to reckon with.</s> <s sid="106" id="portraittwo.c15.s106">She lost herself in infinite dismay when she thought of the magnitude of _his_ deception.</s> <s sid="107" id="portraittwo.c15.s107">It was a wonder, perhaps, in view of this, that he didn't hate her more.</s> <s sid="108" id="portraittwo.c15.s108">She remembered perfectly the first sign he had given of it--it had been like the bell that was to ring up the curtain upon the real drama of their life.</s> <s sid="109" id="portraittwo.c15.s109">He said to her one day that she had too many ideas and that she must get rid of them.</s> <s sid="110" id="portraittwo.c15.s110">He had told her that already, before their marriage; but then she had not noticed it: it had come back to her only afterwards.</s> <s sid="111" id="portraittwo.c15.s111">This time she might well have noticed it, because he had really meant it.</s> <s sid="112" id="portraittwo.c15.s112">The words had been nothing superficially; but when in the light of deepening experience she had looked into them they had then appeared portentous.</s> <s sid="113" id="portraittwo.c15.s113">He had really meant it--he would have liked her to have nothing of her own but her pretty appearance.</s> <s sid="114" id="portraittwo.c15.s114">She had known she had too many ideas; she had more even than he had supposed, many more than she had expressed to him when he had asked her to marry him.</s> <s sid="115" id="portraittwo.c15.s115">Yes, she _had_ been hypocritical; she had liked him so much.</s> <s sid="116" id="portraittwo.c15.s116">She had too many ideas for herself; but that was just what one married for, to share them with some one else.</s> <s sid="117" id="portraittwo.c15.s117">One couldn't pluck them up by the roots, though of course one might suppress them, be careful not to utter them.</s> <s sid="118" id="portraittwo.c15.s118">It had not been this, however, his objecting to her opinions; this had been nothing.</s> <s sid="119" id="portraittwo.c15.s119">She had no opinions--none that she would not have been eager to sacrifice in the satisfaction of feeling herself loved for it.</s> <s sid="120" id="portraittwo.c15.s120">What he had meant had been the whole thing--her character, the way she felt, the way she judged.</s> <s sid="121" id="portraittwo.c15.s121">This was what she had kept in reserve; this was what he had not known until he had found himself--with the door closed behind, as it were--set down face to face with it.</s> <s sid="122" id="portraittwo.c15.s122">She had a certain way of looking at life which he took as a personal offence.</s> <s sid="123" id="portraittwo.c15.s123">Heaven knew that now at least it was a very humble, accommodating way!</s> <s sid="124" id="portraittwo.c15.s124">The strange thing was that she should not have suspected from the first that his own had been so different.</s> <s sid="125" id="portraittwo.c15.s125">She had thought it so large, so enlightened, so perfectly that of an honest man and a gentleman.</s> <s sid="126" id="portraittwo.c15.s126">Hadn't he assured her that he had no superstitions, no dull limitations, no prejudices that had lost their freshness?</s> <s sid="127" id="portraittwo.c15.s127">Hadn't he all the appearance of a man living in the open air of the world, indifferent to small considerations, caring only for truth and knowledge and believing that two intelligent people ought to look for them together and, whether they found them or not, find at least some happiness in the search?</s> <s sid="128" id="portraittwo.c15.s128">He had told her he loved the conventional;

<qe/><title>CHAPTER XLIV.</title>
<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c17.s1">The Countess Gemini was often extremely bored--bored, in her own phrase, to extinction.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c17.s2">She had not been extinguished, however, and she struggled bravely enough with her destiny, which had been to marry an unaccommodating Florentine who insisted upon living in his native town, where he enjoyed such consideration as might attach to a gentleman whose talent for losing at cards had not the merit of being incidental to an obliging disposition.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c17.s3">The Count Gemini was not liked even by those who won from him; and he bore a name which, having a measurable value in Florence, was, like the local coin of the old Italian states, without currency in other parts of the peninsula.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c17.s4">In Rome he was simply a very dull Florentine, and it is not remarkable that he should not have cared to pay frequent visits to a place where, to carry it off, his dulness needed more explanation than was convenient.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c17.s5">The Countess lived with her eyes upon Rome, and it was the constant grievance of her life that she had not an habitation there.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c17.s6">She was ashamed to say how seldom she had been allowed to visit that city; it scarcely made the matter better that there were other members of the Florentine nobility who never had been there at all.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c17.s7">She went whenever she could; that was all she could say.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c17.s8">Or rather not all, but all she said she could say.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c17.s9">In fact she had much more to say about it, and had often set forth the reasons why she hated Florence and wished to end her days in the shadow of Saint Peter's.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c17.s10">They are reasons, however, that do not closely concern us, and were usually summed up in the declaration that Rome, in short, was the Eternal City and that Florence was simply a pretty little place like any other.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c17.s11">The Countess apparently needed to connect the idea of eternity with her amusements.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c17.s12">She was convinced that society was infinitely more interesting in Rome, where you met celebrities all winter at evening parties.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c17.s13">At Florence there were no celebrities; none at least that one had heard of.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c17.s14">Since her brother's marriage her impatience had greatly increased; she was so sure his wife had a more brilliant life than herself.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c17.s15">She was not so intellectual as Isabel, but she was intellectual enough to do justice to Rome--not to the ruins and the catacombs, not even perhaps to the monuments and museums, the church ceremonies and the scenery; but certainly to all the rest.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c17.s16">She heard a great deal about her sister-in-law and knew perfectly that Isabel was having a beautiful time.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c17.s17">She had indeed seen it for herself on the only occasion on which she had enjoyed the hospitality of Palazzo Roccanera.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c17.s18">She had spent a week there during the first winter of her brother's marriage, but she had not been encouraged to renew this satisfaction.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c17.s19">Osmond didn't want her--that she was perfectly aware of; but she would have gone all the same, for after all she didn't care two straws about Osmond.</s> <s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c17.s20">It was her husband who wouldn't let her, and the money question was always a trouble.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c17.s21">Isabel had been very nice; the Countess, who had liked her sister-in-law from the first, had not been blinded by envy to Isabel's personal merits.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c17.s22">She had always observed that she got on better with clever women than with silly ones like herself; the silly ones could never understand her wisdom, whereas the clever ones--the really clever ones--always understood her silliness.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c17.s23">It appeared to her that, different as they were in appearance and general style, Isabel and she had somewhere a patch of common ground that they would set their feet upon at last.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c17.s24">It was not very large, but it was firm, and they should both know it when once they had really touched it.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c17.s25">And then she lived, with Mrs. Osmond, under the influence of a pleasant surprise; she was constantly expecting that Isabel would "look down" on her, and she as constantly saw this operation postponed.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c17.s26">She asked herself when it would begin, like fire-works, or Lent, or the opera season; not that she cared much, but she wondered what kept it in abeyance.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c17.s27">Her sister-in-law regarded her with none but level glances and expressed for the poor Countess as little contempt as admiration.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c17.s28">In reality Isabel would as soon have thought of despising her as of passing a moral judgement on a grasshopper.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraittwo.c17.s29">She was not indifferent to her husband's sister, however; she was rather a little afraid of her.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraittwo.c17.s30">She wondered at her; she thought her very extraordinary.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraittwo.c17.s31">The Countess seemed to her to have no soul; she was like a bright rare shell, with a polished surface and a remarkably pink lip, in which something would rattle when you shook it.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraittwo.c17.s32">This rattle was apparently the Countess's spiritual principle, a little loose nut that tumbled about inside of her.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraittwo.c17.s33">She was too odd for disdain, too anomalous for comparisons.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraittwo.c17.s34">Isabel would have invited her again (there was no question of inviting the Count); but Osmond, after his marriage, had not scrupled to say frankly that Amy was a fool of the worst species--a fool whose folly had the irrepressibility of genius.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraittwo.c17.s35">He said at another time that she had no heart; and he added in a moment that she had given it all away--in small pieces, like a frosted wedding-cake.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraittwo.c17.s36">The fact of not having been asked was of course another obstacle to the Countess's going again to Rome; but at the period with which this history has now to deal she was in receipt of an invitation to spend several weeks at Palazzo Roccanera.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraittwo.c17.s37">The proposal had come from Osmond himself, who wrote to his sister that she must be prepared to be very quiet.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraittwo.c17.s38">Whether or no she found in this phrase all the meaning he had put into it I am unable to say; but she accepted the invitation on any terms.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraittwo.c17.s39">She was curious, moreover; for one of the impressions of her former visit had been that her brother had found his match.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraittwo.c17.s40">Before the marriage she had been sorry for Isabel, so sorry as to have had serious thoughts--if any of the Countess's thoughts were serious--of putting her on her guard.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraittwo.c17.s41">But she had let that pass, and after a little she was reassured.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraittwo.c17.s42">Osmond was as lofty as ever, but his wife would not be an easy victim.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraittwo.c17.s43">The Countess was not very exact at measurements, but it seemed to her that if Isabel should draw herself up she would be the taller spirit of the two.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraittwo.c17.s44">What she wanted to learn now was whether Isabel had drawn herself up; it would give her immense pleasure to see Osmond overtopped.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraittwo.c17.p2" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="portraittwo.c17.s45">Several days before she was to start for Rome a servant brought her the card of a visitor--a card with the simple superscription <qs/>"Henrietta C. Stackpole."<qe/></s> <s sid="46" id="portraittwo.c17.s46">The Countess pressed her finger-tips to her forehead; she didn't remember to have known any such Henrietta as that.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraittwo.c17.s47">The servant then remarked that the lady had requested him to say that if the Countess should not recognise her name she would know her well enough on seeing her.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraittwo.c17.s48">By the time she appeared before her visitor she had in fact reminded herself that there was once a literary lady at Mrs. Touchett's; the only woman of letters she had ever encountered--that is the only modern one, since she was the daughter of a defunct poetess.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraittwo.c17.s49">She recognised Miss Stackpole immediately, the more so that Miss Stackpole seemed perfectly unchanged; and the Countess, who was thoroughly good-natured, thought it rather fine to be called on by a person of that sort of distinction.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraittwo.c17.s50">She wondered if Miss Stackpole had come on account of her mother--whether she had heard of the American Corinne.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraittwo.c17.s51">Her mother was not at all like Isabel's friend; the Countess could see at a glance that this lady was much more contemporary; and she received an impression of the improvements that were taking place--chiefly in distant countries--in the character (the professional character) of literary ladies.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraittwo.c17.s52">Her mother had been used to wear a Roman scarf thrown over a pair of shoulders timorously bared of their tight black velvet (oh the old clothes!) and a gold laurel-wreath set upon a multitude of glossy ringlets.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraittwo.c17.s53">She had spoken softly and vaguely, with the accent of her "Creole" ancestors, as she always confessed; she sighed a great deal and was not at all enterprising.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraittwo.c17.s54">But Henrietta, the Countess could see, was always closely buttoned and compactly braided; there was something brisk and business-like in her appearance; her manner was almost conscientiously familiar.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraittwo.c17.s55">It was as impossible to imagine her ever vaguely sighing as to imagine a letter posted without its address.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraittwo.c17.s56">The Countess could not but feel that the correspondent of the _Interviewer_ was much more in the movement than the American Corinne.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraittwo.c17.s57">She explained that she had called on the Countess because she was the only person she knew in Florence, and that when she visited a foreign city she liked to see something more than superficial travellers.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraittwo.c17.s58">She knew Mrs. Touchett, but Mrs. Touchett was in America, and even if she had been in Florence Henrietta would not have put herself out for her, since Mrs. Touchett was not one of her admirations.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c18.s1">I have already had reason to say that Isabel knew her husband to be displeased by the continuance of Ralph's visit to Rome.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c18.s2">That knowledge was very present to her as she went to her cousin's hotel the day after she had invited Lord Warburton to give a tangible proof of his sincerity; and at this moment, as at others, she had a sufficient perception of the sources of Osmond's opposition.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c18.s3">He wished her to have no freedom of mind, and he knew perfectly well that Ralph was an apostle of freedom.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c18.s4">It was just because he was this, Isabel said to herself, that it was a refreshment to go and see him.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c18.s5">It will be perceived that she partook of this refreshment in spite of her husband's aversion to it, that is partook of it, as she flattered herself, discreetly.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c18.s6">She had not as yet undertaken to act in direct opposition to his wishes; he was her appointed and inscribed master; she gazed at moments with a sort of incredulous blankness at this fact.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c18.s7">It weighed upon her imagination, however; constantly present to her mind were all the traditionary decencies and sanctities of marriage.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c18.s8">The idea of violating them filled her with shame as well as with dread, for on giving herself away she had lost sight of this contingency in the perfect belief that her husband's intentions were as generous as her own.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c18.s9">She seemed to see, none the less, the rapid approach of the day when she should have to take back something she had solemnly bestown.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c18.s10">Such a ceremony would be odious and monstrous; she tried to shut her eyes to it meanwhile.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c18.s11">Osmond would do nothing to help it by beginning first; he would put that burden upon her to the end.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c18.s12">He had not yet formally forbidden her to call upon Ralph; but she felt sure that unless Ralph should very soon depart this prohibition would come.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c18.s13">How could poor Ralph depart?</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c18.s14">The weather as yet made it impossible.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c18.s15">She could perfectly understand her husband's wish for the event; she didn't, to be just, see how he _could_ like her to be with her cousin.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c18.s16">Ralph never said a word against him, but Osmond's sore, mute protest was none the less founded.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c18.s17">If he should positively interpose, if he should put forth his authority, she would have to decide, and that wouldn't be easy.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c18.s18">The prospect made her heart beat and her cheeks burn, as I say, in advance; there were moments when, in her wish to avoid an open rupture, she found herself wishing Ralph would start even at a risk.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c18.s19">And it was of no use that, when catching herself in this state of mind, she called herself a feeble spirit, a coward.</s> <s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c18.s20">It was not that she loved Ralph less, but that almost anything seemed preferable to repudiating the most serious act--the single sacred act--of her life.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c18.s21">That appeared to make the whole future hideous.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c18.s22">To break with Osmond once would be to break for ever; any open acknowledgement of irreconcilable needs would be an admission that their whole attempt had proved a failure.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c18.s23">For them there could be no condonement, no compromise, no easy forgetfulness, no formal readjustment.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c18.s24">They had attempted only one thing, but that one thing was to have been exquisite.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c18.s25">Once they missed it nothing else would do; there was no conceivable substitute for that success.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c18.s26">For the moment, Isabel went to the Hotel de Paris as often as she thought well; the measure of propriety was in the canon of taste, and there couldn't have been a better proof that morality was, so to speak, a matter of earnest appreciation.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c18.s27">Isabel's application of that measure had been particularly free to-day, for in addition to the general truth that she couldn't leave Ralph to die alone she had something important to ask of him.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c18.s28">This indeed was Gilbert's business as well as her own.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c20.s1">It was from Henrietta Stackpole that she learned how Caspar Goodwood had come to Rome; an event that took place three days after Lord Warburton's departure.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c20.s2">This latter fact had been preceded by an incident of some importance to Isabel--the temporary absence, once again, of Madame Merle, who had gone to Naples to stay with a friend, the happy possessor of a villa at Posilippo.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c20.s3">Madame Merle had ceased to minister to Isabel's happiness, who found herself wondering whether the most discreet of women might not also by chance be the most dangerous.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c20.s4">Sometimes, at night, she had strange visions; she seemed to see her husband and her friend--his friend--in dim, indistinguishable combination.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c20.s5">It seemed to her that she had not done with her; this lady had something in reserve.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c20.s6">Isabel's imagination applied itself actively to this elusive point, but every now and then it was checked by a nameless dread, so that when the charming woman was away from Rome she had almost a consciousness of respite.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c20.s7">She had already learned from Miss Stackpole that Caspar Goodwood was in Europe, Henrietta having written to make it known to her immediately after meeting him in Paris.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c20.s8">He himself never wrote to Isabel, and though he was in Europe she thought it very possible he might not desire to see her.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c20.s9">Their last interview, before her marriage, had had quite the character of a complete rupture; if she remembered rightly he had said he wished to take his last look at her.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c20.s10">Since then he had been the most discordant survival of her earlier time--the only one in fact with which a permanent pain was associated.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c20.s11">He had left her that morning with a sense of the most superfluous of shocks: it was like a collision between vessels in broad daylight.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c20.s12">There had been no mist, no hidden current to excuse it, and she herself had only wished to steer wide.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c20.s13">He had bumped against her prow, however, while her hand was on the tiller, and--to complete the metaphor--had given the lighter vessel a strain which still occasionally betrayed itself in a faint creaking.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c20.s14">It had been horrid to see him, because he represented the only serious harm that (to her belief) she had ever done in the world: he was the only person with an unsatisfied claim on her.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c20.s15">She had made him unhappy, she couldn't help it; and his unhappiness was a grim reality.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c20.s16">She had cried with rage, after he had left her, at--she hardly knew what: she tried to think it had been at his want of consideration.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c20.s17">He had come to her with his unhappiness when her own bliss was so perfect; he had done his best to darken the brightness of those pure rays.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c20.s18">He had not been violent, and yet there had been a violence in the impression.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c20.s19">There had been a violence at any rate in something somewhere; perhaps it was only in her own fit of weeping and in that after-sense of the same which had lasted three or four days.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraittwo.c20.p2"><s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c20.s20">The effect of his final appeal had in short faded away, and all the first year of her marriage he had dropped out of her books.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c20.s21">He was a thankless subject of reference; it was disagreeable to have to think of a person who was sore and sombre about you and whom you could yet do nothing to relieve.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c20.s22">It would have been different if she had been able to doubt, even a little, of his unreconciled state, as she doubted of Lord Warburton's; unfortunately it was beyond question, and this aggressive, uncompromising look of it was just what made it unattractive.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c20.s23">She could never say to herself that here was a sufferer who had compensations, as she was able to say in the case of her English suitor.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c20.s24">She had no faith in Mr. Goodwood's compensations and no esteem for them.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c20.s25">A cotton factory was not a compensation for anything--least of all for having failed to marry Isabel Archer.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c20.s26">And yet, beyond that, she hardly knew what he had--save of course his intrinsic qualities.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c20.s27">Oh, he was intrinsic enough; she never thought of his even looking for artificial aids.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c20.s28">If he extended his business--that, to the best of her belief, was the only form exertion could take with him--it would be because it was an enterprising thing, or good for the business; not in the least because he might hope it would overlay the past.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraittwo.c20.s29">This gave his figure a kind of bareness and bleakness which made the accident of meeting it in memory or in apprehension a peculiar concussion; it was deficient in the social drapery commonly muffling, in an overcivilized age, the sharpness of human contacts.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraittwo.c20.s30">His perfect silence, moreover, the fact that she never heard from him and very seldom heard any mention of him, deepened this impression of his loneliness.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraittwo.c20.s31">She asked Lily for news of him, from time to time; but Lily knew nothing of Boston--her imagination was all bounded on the east by Madison Avenue.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraittwo.c20.s32">As time went on Isabel had thought of him oftener, and with fewer restrictions; she had had more than once the idea of writing to him.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraittwo.c20.s33">She had never told her husband about him--never let Osmond know of his visits to her in Florence; a reserve not dictated in the early period by a want of confidence in Osmond, but simply by the consideration that the young man's disappointment was not her secret but his own.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraittwo.c20.s34">It would be wrong of her, she had believed, to convey it to another, and Mr. Goodwood's affairs could have, after all, little interest for Gilbert.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraittwo.c20.s35">When it had come to the point she had never written to him; it seemed to her that, considering his grievance, the least she could do was to let him alone.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraittwo.c20.s36">Nevertheless she would have been glad to be in some way nearer to him.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraittwo.c20.s37">It was not that it ever occurred to her that she might have married him; even after the consequences of her actual union had grown vivid to her that particular reflection, though she indulged in so many, had not had the assurance to present itself.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraittwo.c20.s38">But on finding herself in trouble he had become a member of that circle of things with which she wished to set herself right.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraittwo.c20.s39">I have mentioned how passionately she needed to feel that her unhappiness should not have come to her through her own fault.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraittwo.c20.s40">She had no near prospect of dying, and yet she wished to make her peace with the world--to put her spiritual affairs in order.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraittwo.c20.s41">It came back to her from time to time that there was an account still to be settled with Caspar, and she saw herself disposed or able to settle it to-day on terms easier for him than ever before.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraittwo.c20.s42">Still, when she learned he was coming to Rome she felt all afraid; it would be more disagreeable for him than for any one else to make out--since he _would_ make it out, as over a falsified balance-sheet or something of that sort--the intimate disarray of her affairs.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraittwo.c20.s43">Deep in her breast she believed that he had invested his all in her happiness, while the others had invested only a part.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraittwo.c20.s44">He was one more person from whom she should have to conceal her stress.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraittwo.c20.s45">She was reassured, however, after he arrived in Rome, for he spent several days without coming to see her.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraittwo.c20.p3" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="portraittwo.c20.s46">Henrietta Stackpole, it may well be imagined, was more punctual, and Isabel was largely favoured with the society of her friend.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraittwo.c20.s47">She threw herself into it, for now that she had made such a point of keeping her conscience clear, that was one way of proving she had not been superficial--the more so as the years, in their flight, had rather enriched than blighted those peculiarities which had been humorously criticised by persons less interested than Isabel, and which were still marked enough to give loyalty a spice of heroism.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraittwo.c20.s48">Henrietta was as keen and quick and fresh as ever, and as neat and bright and fair.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraittwo.c20.s49">Her remarkably open eyes, lighted like great glazed railway-stations, had put up no shutters; her attire had lost none of its crispness, her opinions none of their national reference.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraittwo.c20.s50">She was by no means quite unchanged, however it struck Isabel she had grown vague.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraittwo.c20.s51">Of old she had never been vague; though undertaking many enquiries at once, she had managed to be entire and pointed about each.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraittwo.c20.s52">She had a reason for everything she did; she fairly bristled with motives.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraittwo.c20.s53">Formerly, when she came to Europe it was because she wished to see it, but now, having already seen it, she had no such excuse.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraittwo.c20.s54">She didn't for a moment pretend that the desire to examine decaying civilisations had anything to do with her present enterprise; her journey was rather an expression of her independence of the old world than of a sense of further obligations to it.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraittwo.c20.s55"><qs/>"It's nothing to come to Europe,"<qe/><sss/> she said to Isabel; <sse/><qs/>"it doesn't seem to me one needs so many reasons for that.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraittwo.c20.s56">It is something to stay at home; this is much more important."<qe/></s> <s sid="57" id="portraittwo.c20.s57">It was not therefore with a sense of doing anything very important that she treated herself to another pilgrimage to Rome; she had seen the place before and carefully inspected it; her present act was simply a sign of familiarity, of her knowing all about it, of her having as good a right as any one else to be there.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraittwo.c20.s58">This was all very well, and Henrietta was restless; she had a perfect right to be restless too, if one came to that.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraittwo.c20.s59">But she had after all a better reason for coming to Rome than that she cared for it so little.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraittwo.c20.s60">Her friend easily recognised it, and with it the worth of the other's fidelity.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraittwo.c20.s61">She had crossed the stormy ocean in midwinter because she had guessed that Isabel was sad.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraittwo.c20.s62">Henrietta guessed a great deal, but she had never guessed so happily as that.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraittwo.c20.s63">Isabel's satisfactions just now were few, but even if they had been more numerous there would still have been something of individual joy in her sense of being justified in having always thought highly of Henrietta.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraittwo.c20.s64">She had made large concessions with regard to her, and had yet insisted that, with all abatements, she was very valuable.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraittwo.c20.s65">It was not her own triumph, however, that she found good; it was simply the relief of confessing to this confidant, the first person to whom she had owned it, that she was not in the least at her ease.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraittwo.c20.s66">Henrietta had herself approached this point with the smallest possible delay, and had accused her to her face of being wretched.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraittwo.c20.s67">She was a woman, she was a sister; she was not Ralph, nor Lord Warburton, nor Caspar Goodwood, and Isabel could speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="portraittwo.c25.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraittwo.c25.s1">There was a train for Turin and Paris that evening; and after the Countess had left her Isabel had a rapid and decisive conference with her maid, who was discreet, devoted and active.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraittwo.c25.s2">After this she thought (except of her journey) only of one thing.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraittwo.c25.s3">She must go and see Pansy; from her she couldn't turn away.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraittwo.c25.s4">She had not seen her yet, as Osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraittwo.c25.s5">She drove at five o'clock to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the Piazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, a genial and obsequious person.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraittwo.c25.s6">Isabel had been at this institution before; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraittwo.c25.s7">She knew they were good women, and she saw that the large rooms were clean and cheerful and that the well-used garden had sun for winter and shade for spring.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraittwo.c25.s8">But she disliked the place, which affronted and almost frightened her; not for the world would she have spent a night there.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraittwo.c25.s9">It produced to-day more than before the impression of a well-appointed prison; for it was not possible to pretend Pansy was free to leave it.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraittwo.c25.s10">This innocent creature had been presented to her in a new and violent light, but the secondary effect of the revelation was to make her reach out a hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraittwo.c25.p2"><s sid="11" id="portraittwo.c25.s11">The portress left her to wait in the parlour of the convent while she went to make it known that there was a visitor for the dear young lady.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraittwo.c25.s12">The parlour was a vast, cold apartment, with new-looking furniture; a large clean stove of white porcelain, unlighted, a collection of wax flowers under glass, and a series of engravings from religious pictures on the walls.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraittwo.c25.s13">On the other occasion Isabel had thought it less like Rome than like Philadelphia, but to-day she made no reflexions; the apartment only seemed to her very empty and very soundless.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraittwo.c25.s14">The portress returned at the end of some five minutes, ushering in another person.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraittwo.c25.s15">Isabel got up, expecting to see one of the ladies of the sisterhood, but to her extreme surprise found herself confronted with Madame Merle.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraittwo.c25.s16">The effect was strange, for Madame Merle was already so present to her vision that her appearance in the flesh was like suddenly, and rather awfully, seeing a painted picture move.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraittwo.c25.s17">Isabel had been thinking all day of her falsity, her audacity, her ability, her probable suffering; and these dark things seemed to flash with a sudden light as she entered the room.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraittwo.c25.s18">Her being there at all had the character of ugly evidence, of handwritings, of profaned relics, of grim things produced in court.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraittwo.c25.s19">It made Isabel feel faint; if it had been necessary to speak on the spot she would have been quite unable.</s> <s sid="20" id="portraittwo.c25.s20">But no such necessity was distinct to her; it seemed to her indeed that she had absolutely nothing to say to Madame Merle.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraittwo.c25.s21">In one's relations with this lady, however, there were never any absolute necessities; she had a manner which carried off not only her own deficiencies but those of other people.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraittwo.c25.s22">But she was different from usual; she came in slowly, behind the portress, and Isabel instantly perceived that she was not likely to depend upon her habitual resources.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraittwo.c25.s23">For her too the occasion was exceptional, and she had undertaken to treat it by the light of the moment.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraittwo.c25.s24">This gave her a peculiar gravity; she pretended not even to smile, and though Isabel saw that she was more than ever playing a part it seemed to her that on the whole the wonderful woman had never been so natural.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraittwo.c25.s25">She looked at her young friend from head to foot, but not harshly nor defiantly; with a cold gentleness rather, and an absence of any air of allusion to their last meeting.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraittwo.c25.s26">It was as if she had wished to mark a distinction.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraittwo.c25.s27">She had been irritated then, she was reconciled now.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraittwo.c25.p3" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="portraittwo.c25.s28"><qs/>"You can leave us alone,"<qe/><sls/> she said to the portress; <sle/><qs/>"in five minutes this lady will ring for you."<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="portraittwo.c25.s29">And then she turned to Isabel, who, after noting what has just been mentioned, had ceased to notice and had let her eyes wander as far as the limits of the room would allow.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraittwo.c25.s30">She wished never to look at Madame Merle again.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraittwo.c25.s31"><qs/>"You're surprised to find me here, and I'm afraid you're not pleased,"<qe/> this lady went on.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraittwo.c25.s32"><qs/>"You don't see why I should have come; it's as if I had anticipated you.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraittwo.c25.s33">I confess I've been rather indiscreet--I ought to have asked your permission."<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="portraittwo.c25.s34">There was none of the oblique movement of irony in this; it was said simply and mildly; but Isabel, far afloat on a sea of wonder and pain, could not have told herself with what intention it was uttered.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraittwo.c25.s35"><qs/>"But I've not been sitting long,"<qe/><sss/> Madame Merle continued; <sse/><qs/>"that is I've not been long with Pansy.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraittwo.c25.s36">I came to see her because it occurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely and perhaps even a little miserable.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraittwo.c25.s37">It may be good for a small girl; I know so little about small girls; I can't tell.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraittwo.c25.s38">At any rate it's a little dismal.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraittwo.c25.s39">Therefore I came--on the chance.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraittwo.c25.s40">I knew of course that you'd come, and her father as well; still, I had not been told other visitors were forbidden.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraittwo.c25.s41">The good woman--what's her name?</s> <s sid="42" id="portraittwo.c25.s42">Madame Catherine--made no objection whatever.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraittwo.c25.s43">I stayed twenty minutes with Pansy; she has a charming little room, not in the least conventual, with a piano and flowers.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraittwo.c25.s44">She has arranged it delightfully; she has so much taste.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraittwo.c25.s45">Of course it's all none of my business, but I feel happier since I've seen her.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraittwo.c25.s46">She may even have a maid if she likes; but of course she has no occasion to dress.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraittwo.c25.s47">She wears a little black frock; she looks so charming.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraittwo.c25.s48">I went afterwards to see Mother Catherine, who has a very good room too; I assure you I don't find the poor sisters at all monastic.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraittwo.c25.s49">Mother Catherine has a most coquettish little toilet-table, with something that looked uncommonly like a bottle of eau-de-Cologne.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraittwo.c25.s50">She speaks delightfully of Pansy; says it's a great happiness for them to have her.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraittwo.c25.s51">She's a little saint of heaven and a model to the oldest of them.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraittwo.c25.s52">Just as I was leaving Madame Catherine the portress came to say to her that there was a lady for the signorina.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraittwo.c25.s53">Of course I knew it must be you, and I asked her to let me go and receive you in her place.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraittwo.c25.s54">She demurred greatly--I must tell you that--and said it was her duty to notify the Mother Superior; it was of such high importance that you should be treated with respect.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraittwo.c25.s55">I requested her to let the Mother Superior alone and asked her how she supposed I would treat you!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraittwo.c25.p4"><s sid="56" id="portraittwo.c25.s56">So Madame Merle went on, with much of the brilliancy of a woman who had long been a mistress of the art of conversation.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraittwo.c25.s57">But there were phases and gradations in her speech, not one of which was lost upon Isabel's ear, though her eyes were absent from her companion's face.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraittwo.c25.s58">She had not proceeded far before Isabel noted a sudden break in her voice, a lapse in her continuity, which was in itself a complete drama.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraittwo.c25.s59">This subtle modulation marked a momentous discovery--the perception of an entirely new attitude on the part of her listener.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraittwo.c25.s60">Madame Merle had guessed in the space of an instant that everything was at end between them, and in the space of another instant she had guessed the reason why.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraittwo.c25.s61">The person who stood there was not the same one she had seen hitherto, but was a very different person--a person who knew her secret.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraittwo.c25.s62">This discovery was tremendous, and from the moment she made it the most accomplished of women faltered and lost her courage.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraittwo.c25.s63">But only for that moment.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraittwo.c25.s64">Then the conscious stream of her perfect manner gathered itself again and flowed on as smoothly as might be to the end.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraittwo.c25.s65">But it was only because she had the end in view that she was able to proceed.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraittwo.c25.s66">She had been touched with a point that made her quiver, and she needed all the alertness of her will to repress her agitation.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraittwo.c25.s67">Her only safety was in her not betraying herself.</s> <s sid="68" id="portraittwo.c25.s68">She resisted this, but the startled quality of her voice refused to improve--she couldn't help it--while she heard herself say she hardly knew what.</s> <s sid="69" id="portraittwo.c25.s69">The tide of her confidence ebbed, and she was able only just to glide into port, faintly grazing the bottom.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="portraittwo.c25.p5"><s sid="70" id="portraittwo.c25.s70">Isabel saw it all as distinctly as if it had been reflected in a large clear glass.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraittwo.c25.s71">It might have been a great moment for her, for it might have been a moment of triumph.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraittwo.c25.s72">That Madame Merle had lost her pluck and saw before her the phantom of exposure--this in itself was a revenge, this in itself was almost the promise of a brighter day.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraittwo.c25.s73">And for a moment during which she stood apparently looking out of the window, with her back half-turned, Isabel enjoyed that knowledge.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraittwo.c25.s74">On the other side of the window lay the garden of the convent; but this is not what she saw; she saw nothing of the budding plants and the glowing afternoon.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraittwo.c25.s75">She saw, in the crude light of that revelation which had already become a part of experience and to which the very frailty of the vessel in which it had been offered her only gave an intrinsic price, the dry staring fact that she had been an applied handled hung-up tool, as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraittwo.c25.s76">All the bitterness of this knowledge surged into her soul again; it was as if she felt on her lips the taste of dishonour.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraittwo.c25.s77">There was a moment during which, if she had turned and spoken, she would have said something that would hiss like a lash.</s> <s sid="78" id="portraittwo.c25.s78">But she closed her eyes, and then the hideous vision dropped.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraittwo.c25.s79">What remained was the cleverest woman in the world standing there within a few feet of her and knowing as little what to think as the meanest.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraittwo.c25.s80">Isabel's only revenge was to be silent still--to leave Madame Merle in this unprecedented situation.</s> <s sid="81" id="portraittwo.c25.s81">She left her there for a period that must have seemed long to this lady, who at last seated herself with a movement which was in itself a confession of helplessness.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraittwo.c25.s82">Then Isabel turned slow eyes, looking down at her.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraittwo.c25.s83">Madame Merle was very pale; her own eyes covered Isabel's face.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraittwo.c25.s84">She might see what she would, but her danger was over.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraittwo.c25.s85">Isabel would never accuse her, never reproach her; perhaps because she never would give her the opportunity to defend herself.</s> </p>
