<p pid="1" id="vice.c0.p1" type="speech"><s>There is an old story of a punctiliously polite Greek, who, while performing the funeral of an infant daughter, felt bound to make his excuses to the spectators for <qs/>"bringing out such a ridiculously small corpse to so large a crowd."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vice.c0.p2"><s>The Author, although he trusts that the present production has more vitality than the Greek gentleman's child, still feels that in these days of philosophical fiction, metaphysical romance, and novels with a purpose, some apology may perhaps be needed for a tale which has the unambitious and frivolous aim of mere amusement.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vice.c0.p3"><s>However, he ventures to leave the tale to be its own apology, merely contenting himself with the entreaty that his little fish may be spared the rebuke that it is not a whale.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 1. _Black Monday_</title>
<p pid="1" id="vice.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="vice.c1.s1"><qs/>"In England, where boys go to boarding schools, if the holidays were not long there would be no opportunity for cultivating the domestic affections."<qe/>--_Letter of Lord Campbell's, 1835_.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vice.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="vice.c1.s2">On a certain Monday evening late in January, 1881, Paul Bultitude, Esq.</s> <s sid="3" id="vice.c1.s3">(of Mincing Lane, Colonial Produce Merchant), was sitting alone in his dining-room at Westbourne Terrace after dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vice.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="vice.c1.s4">The room was a long and lofty one, furnished in the stern uncompromising style of the Mahogany Age, now supplanted by the later fashions of decoration which, in their outset original and artistic, seem fairly on the way to become as meaningless and conventional.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vice.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="vice.c1.s5">Here were no skilfully contrasted shades of grey or green, no dado, no distemper on the walls; the woodwork was grained and varnished after the manner of the Philistines, the walls papered in dark crimson, with heavy curtains of the same colour, and the sideboard, dinner-waggon, and row of stiff chairs were all carved in the same massive and expensive style of ugliness.</s> <s sid="6" id="vice.c1.s6">The pictures were those familiar presentments of dirty rabbits, fat white horses, bloated goddesses, and misshapen boors, by masters who, if younger than they assume to be, must have been quite old enough to know better.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vice.c1.p5"><s sid="7" id="vice.c1.s7">Mr. Bultitude was a tall and portly person, of a somewhat pompous and overbearing demeanour; not much over fifty, but looking considerably older.</s> <s sid="8" id="vice.c1.s8">He had a high shining head, from which the hair had mostly departed, what little still remained being of a grizzled auburn, prominent pale blue eyes with heavy eyelids and fierce, bushy whitey-brown eyebrows.</s> <s sid="9" id="vice.c1.s9">His general expression suggested a conviction of his own extreme importance, but, in spite of this, his big underlip drooped rather weakly and his double chin slightly receded, giving a judge of character reason for suspecting that a certain obstinate positiveness observable in Mr. Bultitude's manner might possibly be due less to the possession of an unusually strong will than to the circumstance that, by some fortunate chance, that will had hitherto never met with serious opposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vice.c1.p6"><s sid="10" id="vice.c1.s10">The room, with all its aesthetic shortcomings, was comfortable enough, and Mr. Bultitude's attitude--he was lying back in a well-wadded leather arm-chair, with a glass of claret at his elbow and his feet stretched out towards the ruddy blaze of the fire--seemed at first sight to imply that happy after-dinner condition of perfect satisfaction with oneself and things in general, which is the natural outcome of a good cook, a good conscience, and a good digestion.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vice.c1.p7"><s sid="11" id="vice.c1.s11">At first sight; because his face did not confirm the impression--there was a latent uneasiness in it, an air of suppressed irritation, as if he expected and even dreaded to be disturbed at any moment, and yet was powerless to resent the intrusion as he would like to do.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vice.c1.p8"><s sid="12" id="vice.c1.s12">At the slightest sound in the hall outside he would half rise in his chair and glance at the door with a mixture of alarm and resignation, and as often as the steps died away and the door remained closed, he would sink back and resettle himself with a shrug of evident relief.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vice.c1.p9"><s sid="13" id="vice.c1.s13">Habitual novel readers on reading thus far will, I am afraid, prepare themselves for the arrival of a faithful cashier with news of irretrievable ruin, or a mysterious and cynical stranger threatening disclosures of a disgraceful nature.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vice.c1.p10"><s sid="14" id="vice.c1.s14">But all such anticipations must at once be ruthlessly dispelled.</s> <s sid="15" id="vice.c1.s15">Mr. Bultitude, although he was certainly a merchant, was a fairly successful one--in direct defiance of the laws of fiction, where any connection with commerce seems to lead naturally to failure in one of the three volumes.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vice.c1.p11"><s sid="16" id="vice.c1.s16">He was an elderly gentleman, too, of irreproachable character and antecedents; no Damocles' sword of exposure was swinging over his bald but blameless head; he had no disasters to fear and no indiscretions to conceal.</s> <s sid="17" id="vice.c1.s17">He had not been intended for melodrama, with which, indeed, he would not have considered it a respectable thing to be connected.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vice.c1.p12"><s sid="18" id="vice.c1.s18">In fact, the secret of his uneasiness was so absurdly simple and commonplace that I am rather ashamed to have made even a temporary mystery of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vice.c1.p13"><s sid="19" id="vice.c1.s19">His son Dick was about to return to school that evening, and Mr. Bultitude was expecting every moment to be called upon to go through a parting scene with him; that was really all that was troubling him.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vice.c1.p14"><s sid="20" id="vice.c1.s20">This sounds very creditable to the tenderness of his feelings as a father--for there are some parents who bear such a bereavement at the close of the holidays with extraordinary fortitude, if they do not actually betray an unnatural satisfaction at the event.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vice.c1.p15"><s sid="21" id="vice.c1.s21">But it was not exactly from softness of heart that he was restless and impatient, nor did he dread any severe strain upon his emotions.</s> <s sid="22" id="vice.c1.s22">He was not much given to sentiment, and was the author of more than one of those pathetically indignant letters to the papers, in which the British parent denounces the expenses of education and the unconscionable length and frequency of vacations.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vice.c1.p16"><s sid="23" id="vice.c1.s23">He was one of those nervous and fidgety persons who cannot understand their own children, looking on them as objectionable monsters whose next movements are uncertain--much as Frankenstein must have felt towards _his_ monster.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vice.c1.p17"><s sid="24" id="vice.c1.s24">He hated to have a boy about the house, and positively writhed under the irrelevant and irrepressible questions, the unnecessary noises and boisterous high spirits which nothing would subdue; his son's society was to him simply an abominable nuisance, and he pined for a release from it from the day the holidays began.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vice.c1.p18"><s sid="25" id="vice.c1.s25">He had been a widower for nearly three years, and no doubt the loss of a mother's loving tact, which can check the heedless merriment before it becomes intolerable, and interpret and soften the most peevish and unreasonable of rebukes, had done much to make the relations between parent and children more strained than they might otherwise have been.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vice.c1.p19"><s sid="26" id="vice.c1.s26">As it was, Dick's fear of his father was just great enough to prevent any cordiality between them, and not sufficient to make him careful to avoid offence, and it is not surprising if, when the time came for him to return to his house of bondage at Dr. Grimstone's, Crichton House, Market Rodwell, he left his father anything but inconsolable.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="vice.c1.p20"><s sid="27" id="vice.c1.s27">Just now, although Mr. Bultitude was so near the hour of his deliverance, he still had a bad quarter of an hour before him, in which the last farewells must be said, and he found it impossible under these circumstances to compose himself for a quiet half-hour's nap, or retire to the billiard-room for a cup of coffee and a mild cigar, as he would otherwise have done--since he was certain to be disturbed.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vice.c1.p21"><s sid="28" id="vice.c1.s28">And there was another thing which harassed him, and that was a haunting dread lest at the last moment some unforeseen accident should prevent the boy's departure after all.</s> <s sid="29" id="vice.c1.s29">He had some grounds for this, for only a week before, a sudden and unprecedented snowstorm had dashed his hopes, on the eve of their fulfilment, by forcing the Doctor to postpone the day on which his school was to re-assemble, and now Mr. Bultitude sat on brambles until he had seen the house definitely rid of his son's presence.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="vice.c1.p22"><s sid="30" id="vice.c1.s30">All this time, while the father was fretting and fuming in his arm-chair, the son, the unlucky cause of all this discomfort, had been standing on the mat outside the door, trying to screw up enough courage to go in as if nothing was the matter with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vice.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="vice.c1.s31">He was not looking particularly boisterous just then.</s> <s sid="32" id="vice.c1.s32">On the contrary, his face was pale, and his eyelids rather redder than he would quite care for them to be seen by any of the "fellows" at Crichton House.</s> <s sid="33" id="vice.c1.s33">All the life and spirit had gone out of him for the time; he had a troublesome dryness in his throat, and a general sensation of chill heaviness, which he himself would have described--expressively enough, if not with academical elegance--as <qs/>"feeling beastly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="vice.c1.p24"><s sid="34" id="vice.c1.s34">The stoutest hearted boy, returning to the most perfect of schools, cannot always escape something of this at that dark hour when the sands of the holidays have run out to their last golden grain, when the boxes are standing corded and labelled in the hall, and some one is going to fetch the fatal cab.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="vice.c1.p25"><s sid="35" id="vice.c1.s35">Dick had just gone the round of the house, bidding dreary farewells to all the servants; an unpleasant ordeal which he would gladly have dispensed with, if possible, and which did not serve to raise his spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="vice.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="vice.c1.s36">Upstairs, in the bright nursery, he had found his old nurse sitting sewing by the high wire fender.</s> <s sid="37" id="vice.c1.s37">She was a stern, hard-featured old lady, who had systematically slapped him through infancy into boyhood, and he had had some stormy passages with her during the past few weeks; but she softened now in the most unexpected manner as she said good-bye, and told him he was a <qs/>"pleasant, good-hearted young gentleman, after all, though that aggravating and contrairy sometimes."<qe/></s> <s sid="38" id="vice.c1.s38">And then she predicted, with some of the rashness attaching to irresponsibility, that he would be <qs/>"the best boy this next term as ever was, and work hard at all his lessons, and bring home a prize"<qe/>--but all this unusual gentleness only made the interview more difficult to come out of with any credit for self-control.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="vice.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="vice.c1.s39">Then downstairs, the cook had come up in her evening brown print and clean collar, from her warm spice-scented kitchen, to remark cheerily that <qs/>"Lor bless his heart, what with all these telegrafts and things, time flew so fast nowadays that they'd be having him back again before they all knew where they were!"<qe/> which had a certain spurious consolation about it, until one saw that, after all, it put the case entirely from her own standpoint.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="vice.c1.p28"><s sid="40" id="vice.c1.s40">After this Dick had parted from his elder sister Barbara and his young brother Roly, and had arrived where we found him first, at the mat outside the dining-room door, where he still lingered shivering in the cold foggy hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="vice.c1.p29"><s sid="41" id="vice.c1.s41">Somehow, he could not bring himself to take the next step at once; he knew pretty well what his father's feelings would be, and a parting is a very unpleasant ceremony to one who feels that the regret is all on his own side.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="vice.c1.p30"><s sid="42" id="vice.c1.s42">But it was no use putting it off any longer; he resolved at last to go in and get it over, and opened the door accordingly.</s> <s sid="43" id="vice.c1.s43">How warm and comfortable the room looked--more comfortable than it had ever seemed to him before, even on the first day of the holidays!</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="vice.c1.p31"><s sid="44" id="vice.c1.s44">And his father would be sitting there in a quarter of an hour's time, just as he was now, while he himself would be lumbering along to the station through the dismal raw fog!</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="vice.c1.p32"><s sid="45" id="vice.c1.s45">How unspeakably delightful it must be, thought Dick enviously, to be grown up and never worried by the thoughts of school and lesson-books; to be able to look forward to returning to the same comfortable house, and living the same easy life, day after day, week after week, with no fear of a swiftly advancing Black Monday.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="vice.c1.p33"><s sid="46" id="vice.c1.s46">Gloomy moralists might have informed him that we cannot escape school by simply growing up, and that, even for those who contrive this and make a long holiday of their lives, there comes a time when the days are grudgingly counted to a blacker Monday than ever made a school-boy's heart quake within him.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="vice.c1.p34"><s sid="47" id="vice.c1.s47">But then Dick would never have believed them, and the moralists would only have wasted much excellent common sense upon him.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="vice.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="vice.c1.s48">Paul Bultitude's face cleared as he saw his son come in.</s> <s sid="49" id="vice.c1.s49"><qs/>"There you are, eh?"<qe/> he said, with evident satisfaction, as he turned in his chair, intending to cut the scene as short as possible.</s> <s sid="50" id="vice.c1.s50"><qs/>"So you're off at last?</s> <s sid="51" id="vice.c1.s51">Well, holidays can't last for ever--by a merciful decree of Providence, they don't last quite for ever!</s> <s sid="52" id="vice.c1.s52">There, good-bye, good-bye, be a good boy this term, no more scrapes, mind.</s> <s sid="53" id="vice.c1.s53">And now you'd better run away, and put on your coat--you're keeping the cab waiting all this time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="vice.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="vice.c1.s54"><qs/>"No, I'm not,"<qe/><sss/> said Dick, <sse/><qs/>"Boaler hasn't gone to fetch one yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="vice.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="vice.c1.s55"><qs/>"Not gone to fetch a cab yet!"<qe/><sls/> cried Paul, with evident alarm, <sle/><qs/>"why, God bless my soul, what's the man thinking about?</s> <s sid="56" id="vice.c1.s56">You'll lose your train!</s> <s sid="57" id="vice.c1.s57">I know you'll lose the train, and there will be another day lost, after the extra week gone already through that snow!</s> <s sid="58" id="vice.c1.s58">I must see to this myself.</s> <s sid="59" id="vice.c1.s59">Ring the bell, tell Boaler to start this instant--I insist on his fetching a cab this instant!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="vice.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="vice.c1.s60"><qs/>"Well, it's not my fault, you know,"<qe/><sls/> grumbled Dick, not considering so much anxiety at all flattering, <sle/><qs/>"but Boaler has gone now.</s> <s sid="61" id="vice.c1.s61">I just heard the gate shut."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="vice.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="vice.c1.s62"><qs/>"Ah!"<qe/><sls/> said his father, with more composure, <sle/><qs/>"and now,"<qe/><sss/> he suggested, <sse/><qs/>"you'd better shake hands, and then go up and say good-bye to your sister--you've no time to spare."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="vice.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="vice.c1.s63"><qs/>"I've said good-bye to them,"<qe/> said Dick.</s> <s sid="64" id="vice.c1.s64"><qs/>"Mayn't I stay here till--till Boaler comes?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="vice.c1.p41"><s sid="65" id="vice.c1.s65">This request was due, less to filial affection than a faint desire for dessert, which even his feelings could not altogether stifle.</s> <s sid="66" id="vice.c1.s66">Mr. Bultitude granted it with a very bad grace.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="vice.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="vice.c1.s67"><qs/>"I suppose you can if you want to,"<qe/><sss/> he said impatiently, <sse/><qs/>"only do one thing or the other--stay outside, or shut the door and come in and sit down quietly.</s> <s sid="68" id="vice.c1.s68">I cannot sit in a thorough draught!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="vice.c1.p43"><s sid="69" id="vice.c1.s69">Dick obeyed, and applied himself to the dessert with rather an injured expression.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="vice.c1.p44"><s sid="70" id="vice.c1.s70">His father felt a greater sense of constraint and worry than ever; the interview, as he had feared, seemed likely to last some time, and he felt that he ought to improve the occasion in some way, or, at all events, make some observation.</s> <s sid="71" id="vice.c1.s71">But, for all that, he had not the remotest idea what to say to this red-haired, solemn boy, who sat staring gloomily at him in the intervals of filling his mouth.</s> <s sid="72" id="vice.c1.s72">The situation grew more embarrassing every moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="vice.c1.p45"><s sid="73" id="vice.c1.s73">At last, as he felt himself likely to have more to say in reproof than on any other subject, he began with that.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="vice.c1.p46" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="vice.c1.s74"><qs/>"There's one thing I want to talk to you about before you go,"<qe/><sss/> he began, <sse/><qs/>"and that's this.</s> <s sid="75" id="vice.c1.s75">I had a most unsatisfactory report of you this last term; don't let me have that again.</s> <s sid="76" id="vice.c1.s76">Dr. Grimstone tells me--ah, I have his letter here--yes, he says (and just attend, instead of making yourself ill with preserved ginger)--he says, <alt-qs/>'Your son has great natural capacity, and excellent abilities; but I regret to say that, instead of applying himself as he might do, he misuses his advantages, and succeeds in setting a mischievous example to--if not actually misleading--his companions.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="vice.c1.s77">That's a pleasant account for a father to read!</s> <s sid="78" id="vice.c1.s78">Here am I, sending you to an expensive school, furnishing you with great natural capacity and excellent abilities, and--and--every other school requisite, and all you do is to misuse them!</s> <s sid="79" id="vice.c1.s79">It's disgraceful!</s> <s sid="80" id="vice.c1.s80">And misleading your companions, too!</s> <s sid="81" id="vice.c1.s81">Why, at your age, they ought to mislead _you_--No, I don't mean that--but what I may tell you is that I've written a very strong letter to Dr. Grimstone, saying what pain it gave me to hear you misbehaved yourself, and telling him, if he ever caught you setting an example of any sort, mind that, _any_ sort, in the future--he was to, ah, to remember some of Solomon's very sensible remarks on the subject.</s> <s sid="82" id="vice.c1.s82">So I should strongly advise you to take care what you're about in future, for your own sake!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="vice.c1.p47"><s sid="83" id="vice.c1.s83">This was not a very encouraging address, perhaps, but it did not seem to distress Dick to any extent; he had heard very much the same sort of thing several times before, and had been fully prepared for it then.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="vice.c1.p48"><s sid="84" id="vice.c1.s84">He had been seeking distraction in almonds and raisins, but now they only choked instead of consoling him, and he gave them up and sat brooding silently over his hard lot instead, with a dull, blank dejection which those only who have gone through the same thing in their boyhood will understand.</s> <s sid="85" id="vice.c1.s85">To others, whose school life has been one unchequered course of excitement and success, it will be incomprehensible enough--and so much the better for them.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="vice.c1.p49"><s sid="86" id="vice.c1.s86">He sat listening to the grim sphinx clock on the black marble chimneypiece, as it remorselessly ticked away his last few moments of home-life, and he ingeniously set himself to crown his sorrow by reviving recollections of happier days.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="vice.c1.p50"><s sid="87" id="vice.c1.s87">In one of the corners of the overmantel there was still a sprig of withered laurel left forgotten, and his eye fell on it now with grim satisfaction.</s> <s sid="88" id="vice.c1.s88">He made his thoughts travel back to that delightful afternoon on Christmas Eve, when they had all come home riotous through the brilliant streets, laden with purchases from the Baker Street Bazaar, and then had decorated the rooms with such free and careless gaiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="vice.c1.p51"><s sid="89" id="vice.c1.s89">And the Christmas dinner too!</s> <s sid="90" id="vice.c1.s90">He had sat just where he was sitting now, with, ah, such a difference in every other respect--the time had not come then when the thought of "only so many more weeks and days left" had begun to intrude its grisly shape, like the skull at an ancient feast.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="vice.c1.p52" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="vice.c1.s91">And yet he could distinctly recollect now, and with bitter remorse, that he had not enjoyed himself then as much as he ought to have done; he even remembered an impious opinion of his that the proceedings were <qs/>"slow."<qe/></s> <s sid="92" id="vice.c1.s92">Slow! with plenty to eat, and three (four, if he had only known it) more weeks of holiday before him; with Boxing Day and the brisk exhilarating drive to the Crystal Palace immediately following, with all the rest of a season of licence and varied joys to come, which he could hardly trust himself to look back upon now!</s> <s sid="93" id="vice.c1.s93">He must have been mad to think such a thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="vice.c1.p53"><s sid="94" id="vice.c1.s94">Overhead his sister Barbara was playing softly one of the airs from "The Pirates" (it was Frederic's appeal to the Major-General's daughters), and the music, freed from the serio-comic situation which it illustrates, had a tenderness and pathos of its own which went to Dick's heart and intensified his melancholy.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="vice.c1.p54"><s sid="95" id="vice.c1.s95">He had gone (in secret, for Mr. Bultitude disapproved of such dissipations) to hear the Opera in the holidays, and now the piano conjured the whole scene up for him again--there would be no more theatre-going for him for a very long time!</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="vice.c6.p32"><s sid="61" id="vice.c6.s61">But at dinner he found, with a shudder, that he was expected to swallow a thick ragged section of boiled mutton which had been carved and helped so long before he sat down to it, that the stagnant gravy was chilled and congealed into patches of greasy white.</s> <s sid="62" id="vice.c6.s62">He managed to swallow it with many pauses of invincible disgust--only to find it replaced by a solid slab of pale brown suet pudding, sparsely bedewed with unctuous black treacle.</s> </p>

<p pid="99" id="vice.c8.p99"><s sid="215" id="vice.c8.s215">It was quite extraordinary to see how the game, which had hitherto decidedly languished and hung fire, now quickened into briskness and became positively spirited.</s> <s sid="216" id="vice.c8.s216">Everyone developed a hearty interest in it, and it would almost seem as if the boys, with more delicacy than they are generally credited with, were unwilling to let their master guess how little his indulgence was really appreciated.</s> <s sid="217" id="vice.c8.s217">Even Mr. Tinkler, whose novel had kept him spell-bound on his rail all through the recent excitement, now slipped it hurriedly into his pocket and rushed energetically into the fray, shouting encouragement rather indiscriminately to either side, till he had an opportunity of finding out privately to which leader he had been assigned.</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="vice.c8.p107"><s sid="235" id="vice.c8.s235">It was bitter for him to run meekly about while scathing sarcasms and comments on his want of courage were being hurled at his head.</s> <s sid="236" id="vice.c8.s236">It shattered the scanty remnants of his self-respect, but he dared not protest or say a single word to open the Doctor's eyes to the injustice he was doing him.</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="vice.c8.p108"><s sid="237" id="vice.c8.s237">He was unpleasantly reminded, too, of the disfavour he had acquired amongst his companions, by some one or other of them running up to him every moment when the Doctor's attention was called elsewhere, and startling his nerves by a sly jog or pinch, or an abusive epithet hissed viciously into his ears--Chawner being especially industrious in this respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vice.c9.p7"><s sid="12" id="vice.c9.s12">This, of course, brought him into suspicion, for such conduct had the appearance of a systematic course of practical joking, and even the most impartial teachers will sometimes form an unfavourable opinion of a particular boy on rather slender grounds, and then find fresh confirmation of it in his most insignificant actions.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vice.c9.p8"><s sid="13" id="vice.c9.s13">As for the school generally, his scowls and his sullenness, his deficiency in the daring and impudence that had warmed their hearts towards Dick, and, above all, his strange knack of getting them into trouble--for he seldom received what he considered an indignity without making a formal complaint--all this brought him as much hearty dislike and contempt as, perhaps, the most unsympathetic boy ever earned since boarding-schools were first invented.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vice.c9.p9"><s sid="14" id="vice.c9.s14">The only boy who still seemed to retain a secret tenderness for him, as the Dick he had once looked up to and admired, was Jolland, who persisted in believing, and in stating his belief, that this apparent change of demeanour was a perverted kind of joke on Bultitude's part, which he would condescend to explain some day when it had gone far enough, and he wearied and annoyed Paul beyond endurance by perpetually urging him to abandon his ill-judged experiment and discover the point of the jest.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vice.c9.p10"><s sid="15" id="vice.c9.s15">But for Jolland's help, which he persevered in giving in spite of the opposition and unpopularity it brought upon himself, Mr. Bultitude would have found it impossible to make any pretence of performing the tasks required of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vice.c9.p11"><s sid="16" id="vice.c9.s16">He found himself expected, as a matter of course, to have a certain familiarity with Greek paradigms and German conversation scraps, propositions in Euclid and Latin gerunds, of all of which, having had a strict commercial education in his young days, he had not so much as heard before his metamorphosis.</s> <s sid="17" id="vice.c9.s17">But by carefully copying Jolland's exercises, and introducing enough mistakes of his own to supply the necessary local colour, he was able to escape to a great degree the discovery of his blank ignorance on all these subjects--an ignorance which would certainly have been put down as mere idleness and obstinacy.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vice.c9.p12"><s sid="18" id="vice.c9.s18">But it will be readily believed that he lived in constant fear of such discovery, and as it was, his dependence on a little scamp like his son's friend was a sore humiliation to one who had naturally supposed hitherto that any knowledge he had not happened to acquire could only be meretricious and useless.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vice.c12.p3"><s sid="3" id="vice.c12.s3">Very possibly Chawner's interference in Mr. Bultitude's private affairs has surprised others besides the victim of it; but the fact is that there was a most unfortunate misunderstanding between them from the very first, which prevented the one from seeing, the other from explaining, the real state of the case.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vice.c12.p4"><s sid="4" id="vice.c12.s4">Chawner, of course, no more guessed Paul's true name and nature than anyone else who had come in contact with him in his impenetrable disguise, and his motive for attempting to prevent an interview with the Doctor can only, I fear, be explained by another slight digression.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vice.c12.p5"><s sid="5" id="vice.c12.s5">The Doctor, from a deep sense of his responsibility for the morals of those under his care, was perhaps a trifle over-anxious to clear his moral garden of every noxious weed, and too constant in his vigilant efforts to detect the growing shoot of evil from the moment it showed above the surface.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vice.c12.p6"><s sid="6" id="vice.c12.s6">As he could not be everywhere, however, it is evident that many offences, trivial or otherwise, must have remained unsuspected and unpunished, but for a theory which he had originated and took great pains to propagate amongst his pupils.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vice.c12.p7"><s sid="7" id="vice.c12.s7">The theory was that every right-minded boy ought to feel himself in such a fiduciary position towards his master, that it became a positive duty to acquaint him with any delinquencies he might happen to observe among his fellows; and if, at the same time, he was oppressed by a secret burden on his own conscience, it was understood that he might hope that the joint revelation would go far to mitigate his own punishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vice.c12.p8"><s sid="8" id="vice.c12.s8">It is doubtful whether this system, though I believe it is found successful in Continental colleges, can be usefully applied to English boys; whether it may not produce a habit of mutual distrust and suspicion, and a tone the reverse of healthy.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vice.c12.p9" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="vice.c12.s9">For myself, I am inclined to think that a schoolmaster will find it better in the long run, for both the character and morals of his school, if he is not too anxious to play the detective, and refrains from encouraging the more weak-minded or cowardly boys to save themselves by turning <qs/>"schoolmaster's evidence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vice.c12.p10"><s sid="10" id="vice.c12.s10">Dr. Grimstone thought otherwise; but it must be allowed that the system, as in vogue at Crichton House, did not work well.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vice.c12.p11"><s sid="11" id="vice.c12.s11">There were boys, of course, who took a sturdier view of their own rights and duties, and despised the talebearers as they deserved; there were others, also, too timid and too dependent on the good opinion of others to risk the loss of it by becoming informers; but there were always one or two whose consciences were unequal to the burden of their neighbour's sin, and could only be relieved by frank and full confession.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vice.c12.p12"><s sid="12" id="vice.c12.s12">Unhappily they had, as a general rule, contributed largely to the sum of guilt themselves, and did not resort to disclosure until detection seemed reasonably imminent.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vice.c12.p13"><s sid="13" id="vice.c12.s13">Chawner was the leader of this conscientious band; he revelled in the system.</s> <s sid="14" id="vice.c12.s14">It gave him the means at once of gratifying the almost universal love of power and of indulging a catlike passion for playing with the feelings of others, which, it is to be hoped, is more uncommon.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vice.c12.p14"><s sid="15" id="vice.c12.s15">He knew he was not popular, but he could procure most of the incidents of popularity; he could have his little court of cringing toadies; he could levy his tribute of conciliatory presents, and vent many private spites and hatreds into the bargain--and he generally did.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vice.c12.p15"><s sid="16" id="vice.c12.s16">Having himself a tendency to acts of sly disobedience, he found it a congenial pastime to set the fashion from time to time in some one of the peccadilloes to which boyhood is prone, and to which the Doctor's somewhat restrictive code added a large number, and as soon as he saw a sufficient number of his companions satisfactorily implicated, his opportunity came.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vice.c12.p16"><s sid="17" id="vice.c12.s17">He would take the chief culprits aside, and profess, in strict confidence, certain qualms of conscience which he feared could only be appeased by unburdening his guilt-laden soul.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vice.c12.p17"><s sid="18" id="vice.c12.s18">To this none would have had any right to object--had it not necessarily, or at least from Chawner's point of view, involved a full, true, and particular account of the misdoings of each and every one; and consequently, for some time after these professions of misgivings, Chawner would be surrounded by a little crowd of anxiously obsequious friends, all trying hard to overcome his scruples or persuade him at least to omit their names from his revelations.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vice.c12.p18"><s sid="19" id="vice.c12.s19">Sometimes he would affect to be convinced by their arguments and send them away reassured; at others his scruples would return in an aggravated form; and so he would keep them on tenterhooks of suspense for days and weeks, until he was tired of the amusement--for this practising on the fears of weaker natures is a horribly keen delight to some--or until some desperate little dog, unable to bear his torture any longer, would threaten to give himself up and make an end of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vice.c12.p19"><s sid="20" id="vice.c12.s20">Then Chawner, to do him justice, always relieved him from so disagreeable a necessity, and would go softly into the Doctor's study, and, in a subdued and repentant tone, pour out his general confession for the public good.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="vice.c12.p20"><s sid="21" id="vice.c12.s21">Probably the Doctor did not altogether respect the instruments he saw fit to use in this way; some would have declined to hear the informer out, flogged him well, and forgotten it; but Dr. Grimstone--though he was hardly likely to be impressed by these exhibitions of noble candour, and did not fail to see that the prospect of obtaining better terms for the penitent himself had something to do with them--yet encouraged the system as a matter of policy, went thoroughly into the whole affair, and made it the cause of an explosion which he considered would clear the moral atmosphere for some time to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vice.c12.p21"><s sid="22" id="vice.c12.s22">I hope that, after this explanation, Chawner's opposition to Mr. Bultitude's plans will be better understood.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="vice.c12.p36"><s sid="51" id="vice.c12.s51">The note was too evidently genuine; Dick must have written it (as a matter of fact he had; in a moment of pique, no doubt, at some caprice of his real enslaver Dulcie's--but his fickleness brought fatal results on his poor father's undeserving head)--if this diabolical Chawner carried out his threats he would indeed be "done for"; he did not yet fully understand the other's motive, but he thought that he feared lest Paul, in declaring his own sorrows, might also accuse Tipping and Coker of acts of cruelty and oppression, which Chawner proposed to denounce himself at some more convenient opportunity; he hesitated painfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="vice.c19.p120"><s sid="234" id="vice.c19.s234">So the cab rolled away, and Paul went up to the drawing-room, where, although he certainly allowed the fireworks on the balcony and in the garden to languish forgotten on their sticks, he led all the other revels up to an advanced hour with jovial _abandon_ quite worthy of Dick, and none of his little guests ever suspected the change of host.</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="vice.c19.p121"><s sid="235" id="vice.c19.s235">When it was all over, and the sleepy children had driven off, Paul sat down in an easy chair by the bright fire which sparkled frostily in his bedroom, to think gratefully over all the events of the day--events which were beginning already to take an unreal and fantastic shape.</s> </p>

<p pid="122" id="vice.c19.p122"><s sid="236" id="vice.c19.s236">Bitterly as he had suffered, and in spite of the just anger and thirst for revenge with which he had returned, I am glad to say he did not regret the spirit of mildness that had stayed his hand when his hour of triumph came.</s> </p>

<p pid="123" id="vice.c19.p123"><s sid="237" id="vice.c19.s237">His experiences, unpleasant as they had been, had had their advantages: they had drawn him and his family closer together.</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="vice.c19.p124"><s sid="238" id="vice.c19.s238">In his daughter Barbara, as she wished him good-night (knowing nothing, of course, of the escape), he had suddenly become aware of a girlish freshness and grace he had never looked for or cared to see before.</s> <s sid="239" id="vice.c19.s239">Roly after this, too, had a claim upon him he could never wish to forget, and even with the graceless Dick there was a warmer and more natural feeling on both sides--a strange result, no doubt, of such unfilial behaviour, but so it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="vice.c19.p125"><s sid="240" id="vice.c19.s240">Mr. Bultitude would never after this consider his family as a set of troublesome and thankless incumbrances; thanks to Dick's offices during the interregnum, they would henceforth throw off their reserve and constraint in their father's presence, and in so doing, open his eyes to qualities of which he had hitherto been in contented ignorance.</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="vice.c19.p127"><s sid="242" id="vice.c19.s242">It would be pleasanter perhaps to take leave of Mr. Bultitude thus, as he sits by his bedroom fire in the first flush of supreme and unalloyed content.</s> </p>

<p pid="128" id="vice.c19.p128"><s sid="243" id="vice.c19.s243">But I feel almost bound to point out a fact which few will find any difficulty in accepting, namely, that, although the wrong had been retrieved without scandal or exposure, for which Paul could not be too thankful, there were many consequences which could not but survive it.</s> </p>

<p pid="129" id="vice.c19.p129"><s sid="244" id="vice.c19.s244">Neither father nor son found himself exactly in the same position as before their exchange of characters.</s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="vice.c19.p130" type="speech"><s sid="245" id="vice.c19.s245">It took Mr. Bultitude considerable time and trouble to repair all the damage his son's boyish excesses had wrought both at Westbourne Terrace and in the City.</s> <s sid="246" id="vice.c19.s246">He found the discipline of his clerks' room and counting-house sorely relaxed, and his office-boy in particular attempted a tone towards him of such atrocious familiarity that he was indignantly dismissed, much to his astonishment, the very first day.</s> <s sid="247" id="vice.c19.s247">And probably Paul will never quite clear himself of the cloud that hangs over a man of business who, in the course of however well regulated a career, is known to have been at least once <qs/>"a little odd."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="131" id="vice.c19.p131"><s sid="248" id="vice.c19.s248">And his home, too, was distinctly demoralised: his cook was an artist, unrivalled at soups and entrees; but he had to get rid of her notwithstanding.</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="vice.c19.p132"><s sid="249" id="vice.c19.s249">It was only too evident that she looked upon herself as the prospective mistress of his household, and he did not feel called upon as a parent to fulfil any expectations which Dick's youthful cupboard love had unintentionally excited.</s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="vice.c19.p133"><s sid="250" id="vice.c19.s250">For some time, as fresh proof of Dick's extravagances came home to him, Paul found it cost him no little effort to restrain a tendency to his former bitterness and resentment, but he valued the new understanding between himself and his son too highly to risk losing it again by any open reproach, and so with each succeeding discovery the victory over his feelings became easier.</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="vice.c19.p134"><s sid="251" id="vice.c19.s251">As for Dick, he found the inconveniences at which his father had hinted anything but imaginary, as will perhaps be easily understood.</s> </p>

<p pid="135" id="vice.c19.p135"><s sid="252" id="vice.c19.s252">It was an unpleasant shock to discover that in one short week his father had contrived somehow to procure him a lasting unpopularity.</s> <s sid="253" id="vice.c19.s253">He was obviously looked upon by all, masters and boys, as a confirmed coward and sneak.</s> <s sid="254" id="vice.c19.s254">And although some of his companions could not fairly reproach him on the latter score, the imputation was particularly galling to Dick, who had always treated such practices with sturdy contempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="vice.c19.p136"><s sid="255" id="vice.c19.s255">He was sorely tempted at times to right himself by declaring the real state of the case; but he remembered his promise and his father's unexpected clemency and his gratitude always kept him silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="137" id="vice.c19.p137"><s sid="256" id="vice.c19.s256">He never quite understood how it was that the whole school seemed to have an impression that they could kick and assault him generally with perfect impunity; but a few very unsuccessful experiments convinced them that this was a popular error on their part.</s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="vice.c19.p138"><s sid="257" id="vice.c19.s257">Although, however, in everything else he did gradually succeed in recovering all the ground his father had lost him, yet there was one respect in which, I am sorry to say, he found all his efforts to retrieve himself hopeless.</s> </p>

<p pid="139" id="vice.c19.p139"><s sid="258" id="vice.c19.s258">His little sweetheart, with the grey eyes and soft brown hair, cruelly refused to have anything more to do with him.</s> <s sid="259" id="vice.c19.s259">For Dulcie's pride had been wounded by what she considered his shameless perfidy on that memorable Saturday by the parallel bars; the last lingering traces of affection had vanished before Paul's ingratitude on the following Monday, and she never forgave him.</s> </p>

<p pid="141" id="vice.c19.p141"><s sid="262" id="vice.c19.s262">This was Dick's punishment, and a very real and heavy one he found it.</s> <s sid="263" id="vice.c19.s263">He is at Harrow now, where he is doing fairly well; but I think there are moments even yet when Dulcie's charming little face, her pretty confidences, and her chilling disdain, are remembered with something as nearly resembling a heartache as a healthy unsentimental boy can allow himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="144" id="vice.c19.p144"><s sid="268" id="vice.c19.s268">And with these very sincere wishes I beg to bid them a reluctant farewell.</s> </p>
