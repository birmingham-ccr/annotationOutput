<p pid="1" id="overtheway.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="overtheway.c1.s1">The little old lady lived over the way, through a green gate that shut with a click, and up three white steps.</s> <s sid="2" id="overtheway.c1.s2">Every morning at eight o'clock the church bell chimed for Morning Prayer--chim! chime! chim! chime!--and every morning at eight o'clock the little old lady came down the white steps, and opened the gate with a click, and went where the bells were calling.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="overtheway.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="overtheway.c1.s3">About this time also little Ida would kneel on a chair at her nursery window in the opposite house to watch the old lady come out and go.</s> <s sid="4" id="overtheway.c1.s4">The old lady was one of those people who look always the same.</s> <s sid="5" id="overtheway.c1.s5">Every morning her cheeks looked like faded rose-leaves, and her white hair like a snow-wreath in a garden laughing at the last tea-rose.</s> <s sid="6" id="overtheway.c1.s6">Every morning she wore the same black satin bonnet, and the same white shawl; had delicate gloves on the smallest of hands, and gathered her skirt daintily up from the smallest of feet.</s> <s sid="7" id="overtheway.c1.s7">Every morning she carried a clean pocket-handkerchief, and a fresh rose in the same hand with her Prayer-book; and as the Prayer-book, being bound up with the Bible, was very thick, she seemed to have some difficulty in so doing.</s> <s sid="8" id="overtheway.c1.s8">Every morning, whatever the weather might be, she stood outside the green gate, and looked up at the sky to see if this were clear, and down at the ground to see if that were dry; and so went where the bells were calling.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="overtheway.c1.p3"><s sid="9" id="overtheway.c1.s9">Ida knew the little old lady quite well by sight, but she did not know her name.</s> <s sid="10" id="overtheway.c1.s10">Perhaps Ida's great-uncle knew it; but he was a grave, unsociable man, who saw very little of his neighbours, so perhaps he did not; and Ida stood too much in awe of him to trouble him with idle questions.</s> <s sid="11" id="overtheway.c1.s11">She had once asked Nurse, but Nurse did not know; so the quiet orphan child asked no more.</s> <s sid="12" id="overtheway.c1.s12">She made up a name for the little old lady herself, however, after the manner of Mr. John Bunyan, and called her Mrs. Overtheway; and morning after morning, though the bread-and-milk breakfast smoked upon the table, she would linger at the window, beseeching--</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="overtheway.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="overtheway.c1.s18">Little Ida's history was a sad one.</s> <s sid="19" id="overtheway.c1.s19">Her troubles began when she was but a year old, with the greatest of earthly losses--for then her mother died, leaving a sailor husband and their infant child.</s> <s sid="20" id="overtheway.c1.s20">The sea-captain could face danger, but not an empty home; so he went back to the winds and the waves, leaving his little daughter with relations.</s> <s sid="21" id="overtheway.c1.s21">Six long years had he been away, and Ida had had many homes, and yet, somehow, no home, when one day the postman brought her a large letter, with her own name written upon it in a large hand.</s> <s sid="22" id="overtheway.c1.s22">This was no old envelope sealed up again--no make-believe epistle to be put into the post through the nursery door: it was a real letter, with a real seal, real stamps, and a great many post-marks; and when Ida opened it there were two sheets written by the Captain's very own hand, in round fat characters, easy to read, with a sketch of the Captain's very own ship at the top, and--most welcome above all!--the news that the Captain's very own self was coming home.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="overtheway.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="overtheway.c1.s23"><qs/>"I shall have a papa all to myself very soon, Nurse,"<qe/> said Ida.</s> <s sid="24" id="overtheway.c1.s24"><qs/>"He has written a letter to me, and made me a picture of his ship; it is the <alt-qs/>'Bonne Esperance,'<alt-qe/> which he says means Good Hope.</s> <s sid="25" id="overtheway.c1.s25">I love this letter better than anything he has ever sent me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="overtheway.c1.p9"><s sid="26" id="overtheway.c1.s26">Nevertheless, Ida took out the carved fans and workboxes, the beads, and handkerchiefs, and feathers, the dainty foreign treasures the sailor-father had sent to her from time to time; dusted them, kissed them, and told them that the Captain was coming home.</s> <s sid="27" id="overtheway.c1.s27">But the letter she wore in her pocket by day, and kept under her pillow by night.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="overtheway.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="overtheway.c1.s28"><qs/>"Why don't you put your letter into one of your boxes, like a tidy young lady, Miss Ida?"<qe/> said Nurse.</s> <s sid="29" id="overtheway.c1.s29"><qs/>"You'll wear it all to bits doing as you do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="overtheway.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="overtheway.c1.s30"><qs/>"It will last till the ship comes home,"<qe/> said Miss Ida.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="overtheway.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="overtheway.c1.s31">It had need then to have been written on the rock, graven with an iron pen for ever; for the <qs/>"Bonne Esperance"<qe/> (like other earthly hopes) had perished to return no more.</s> <s sid="32" id="overtheway.c1.s32">She foundered on her homeward voyage, and went down into the great waters, whilst Ida slept through the stormy night, with the Captain's letter beneath her pillow.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="overtheway.c1.p15"><s sid="37" id="overtheway.c1.s37">Two or three months had now passed away since Ida became an orphan.</s> <s sid="38" id="overtheway.c1.s38">She had become accustomed to the crape-hung frock; she had learnt to read the Captain's letter as the memorial of a good hope which it had pleased God to disappoint; she was fairly happy again.</s> <s sid="39" id="overtheway.c1.s39">It was in the midst of that new desolation in her lonely life that she had come to stay with her great-uncle, and had begun to watch the doings of the little old lady who lived over the way.</s> <s sid="40" id="overtheway.c1.s40">When dolls seemed vanity, and Noah's Ark a burden, it had been a quiet amusement, demanding no exertion, to see what little she could see of the old lady's life, and to speculate about what she could not; to wonder and fancy what Mrs. Overtheway looked like without her bonnet, and what she did with herself when she was not at church.</s> <s sid="41" id="overtheway.c1.s41">Ida's imagination did not carry her far.</s> <s sid="42" id="overtheway.c1.s42">She believed her friend to be old, immeasurably old, indefinitely old; and had a secret faith that she had never been otherwise.</s> <s sid="43" id="overtheway.c1.s43">She felt sure that she wore a cap indoors, and that it was a nicer one than Nurse's; that she had real tea, with sugar and cream, instead of milk-and-water, and hot toast rather than bread-and-treacle for tea; that she helped herself at meals, and went to bed according to her own pleasure and convenience; was--perhaps on these very grounds--utterly happy, and had always been so.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="overtheway.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="overtheway.c1.s44"><qs/>"I am only a little girl,"<qe/> said Ida, as she pressed her face sadly to the cold window-pane.</s> <s sid="45" id="overtheway.c1.s45"><qs/>"I am only a little girl, and very sad, you know, because Papa was drowned at sea; but Mrs. Overtheway is very old, and always happy, and so I love her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="overtheway.c1.p17"><s sid="46" id="overtheway.c1.s46">And in this there was both philosophy and truth.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="overtheway.c1.p18"><s sid="47" id="overtheway.c1.s47">It is a mistake to suppose that the happiness of others is always a distasteful sight to the sad at heart.</s> <s sid="48" id="overtheway.c1.s48">There are times in which life seems shorn of interests and bereaved of pleasure, when it is a relief, almost amounting to consolation, to believe that any one is happy.</s> <s sid="49" id="overtheway.c1.s49">It is some feeling of this nature, perhaps, which makes the young so attractive to the old.</s> <s sid="50" id="overtheway.c1.s50">It soothes like the sound of harmonious music, the sight of harmonious beauty.</s> <s sid="51" id="overtheway.c1.s51">It witnesses to a conviction lying deep even in the most afflicted souls that (come what may), all things were created good, and man made to be blessed; before which sorrow and sighing flee away.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="overtheway.c1.p19"><s sid="52" id="overtheway.c1.s52">This was one of many things which formed the attraction for Ida in the little old lady who lived over the way.</s> <s sid="53" id="overtheway.c1.s53">That green gate shut in a life of which the child knew nothing, and which might be one of mysterious delights; to believe that such things could be was consoling, and to imagine them was real entertainment.</s> <s sid="54" id="overtheway.c1.s54">Ida would sometimes draw a chair quietly to the table beside her own, and fancy that Mrs. Overtheway was having tea with her.</s> <s sid="55" id="overtheway.c1.s55">She would ask the old lady if she had been in time for church that morning, beg her to take off her bonnet, and apologise politely for the want of hot tea and toast.</s> <s sid="56" id="overtheway.c1.s56">So far all was well, for Ida could answer any of these remarks on Mrs. Overtheway's behalf; but it may be believed that after a certain point this one-sided conversation flagged.</s> <s sid="57" id="overtheway.c1.s57">One day Nurse overheard Ida's low murmurs.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="overtheway.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="overtheway.c1.s58"><qs/>"What are you talking about, Miss Ida?"<qe/> said she.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="overtheway.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="overtheway.c1.s59"><qs/>"I am pretending to have Mrs. Overtheway to tea,"<qe/> said Ida.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="overtheway.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="overtheway.c1.s60"><qs/>"Little girls shouldn't pretend what's not true,"<qe/> replied Nurse, in whose philosophy fancy and falsehood were not distinguished.</s> <s sid="61" id="overtheway.c1.s61"><qs/>"Play with your dolls, my dear, and don't move the chairs out of their places."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="overtheway.c1.p23"><s sid="62" id="overtheway.c1.s62">With which Nurse carried off the chair into a corner as if it had been a naughty child, and Ida gave up her day-dream with a sigh; since to have prolonged the fancy that Mrs. Overtheway was present, she must have imagined her borne off at the crisis of the meal after a fashion not altogether consistent with an old lady's dignity.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="overtheway.c1.p24"><s sid="63" id="overtheway.c1.s63">Summer passed, and winter came on.</s> <s sid="64" id="overtheway.c1.s64">There were days when the white steps looked whiter than usual; when the snowdrift came halfway up the little green gate, and the snowflakes came softly down with a persistency which threatened to bury the whole town.</s> <s sid="65" id="overtheway.c1.s65">Ida knew that on such days Mrs. Overtheway could not go out; but whenever it was tolerably fine the old lady appeared as usual, came daintily down the steps, and went where the bells were calling.</s> <s sid="66" id="overtheway.c1.s66">Chim! chime! chim! chime!</s> <s sid="67" id="overtheway.c1.s67">They sounded so near through the frosty air, that Ida could almost have fancied that the church was coming round through the snowy streets to pick up the congregation.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="overtheway.c1.p25"><s sid="68" id="overtheway.c1.s68">Mrs. Overtheway looked much the same in winter as in summer.</s> <s sid="69" id="overtheway.c1.s69">She seemed as fresh and lively as ever, carried her Prayer-book and handkerchief in the same hand, was only more warmly wrapped up, and wore fur-lined boots, which were charming.</s> <s sid="70" id="overtheway.c1.s70">There was one change, however, which went to Ida's heart.</s> <s sid="71" id="overtheway.c1.s71">The little old lady had no longer a flower to take to church with her.</s> <s sid="72" id="overtheway.c1.s72">At Christmas she took a sprig of holly, and after that a spray of myrtle, but Ida felt that these were poor substitutes for a rose.</s> <s sid="73" id="overtheway.c1.s73">She knew that Mrs. Overtheway had flowers somewhere, it is true, for certain pots of forced hyacinths had passed through the little green gate to the Christmas church decorations; but one's winter garden is too precious to be cropped as recklessly as summer rose-bushes, and the old lady went flowerless to church and enjoyed her bulbs at home.</s> <s sid="74" id="overtheway.c1.s74">But the change went to Ida's heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="overtheway.c1.p26"><s sid="75" id="overtheway.c1.s75">Spring was early that year.</s> <s sid="76" id="overtheway.c1.s76">At the beginning of February there was a good deal of snow on the ground, it is true, but the air became milder and milder, and towards the end of the month there came a real spring day, and all the snow was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="overtheway.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="overtheway.c1.s77"><qs/>"You may go and play in the garden, Miss Ida,"<qe/> said Nurse, and Ida went.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="overtheway.c1.p28"><s sid="78" id="overtheway.c1.s78">She had been kept indoors for a long time by the weather and by a cold, and it was very pleasant to get out again, even when the only amusement was to run up and down the shingly walks and wonder how soon she might begin to garden, and whether the gardener could be induced to give her a piece of ground sufficiently extensive to grow a crop of mustard-and-cress in the form of a capital I.</s> <s sid="79" id="overtheway.c1.s79">It was the kitchen garden into which Ida had been sent.</s> <s sid="80" id="overtheway.c1.s80">At the far end it was cut off from the world by an overgrown hedge with large gaps at the bottom, through which Ida could see the high road, a trough for watering horses, and beyond this a wood.</s> <s sid="81" id="overtheway.c1.s81">The hedge was very thin in February, and Ida had a good view in consequence, and sitting on a stump in the sunshine she peered through the gap to see if any horses came to drink.</s> <s sid="82" id="overtheway.c1.s82">It was as good as a peep-show, and indeed much better.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="overtheway.c1.p30"><s sid="98" id="overtheway.c1.s98">It was like a wonderful fairy-tale, to which Ida listened with clasped hands.</s> </p>
