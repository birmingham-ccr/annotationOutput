<p pid="1" id="daisy.c0.p1"><s>PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="daisy.c0.p2"><s>No one can be more sensible than is the Author that the present is an overgrown book of a nondescript class, neither the "tale" for the young, nor the novel for their elders, but a mixture of both.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="daisy.c0.p3"><s>Begun as a series of conversational sketches, the story outran both the original intention and the limits of the periodical in which it was commenced; and, such as it has become, it is here presented to those who have already made acquaintance with the May family, and may be willing to see more of them.</s> <s>It would beg to be considered merely as what it calls itself, a Family Chronicle--a domestic record of home events, large and small, during those years of early life when the character is chiefly formed, and as an endeavour to trace the effects of those aspirations which are a part of every youthful nature.</s> <s>That the young should take one hint, to think whether their hopes and upward-breathings are truly upwards, and founded in lowliness, may be called the moral of the tale.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="daisy.c0.p4"><s>For those who may deem the story too long, and the characters too numerous, the Author can only beg their pardon for any tedium that they may have undergone before giving it up.</s> <s>Feb.</s> <s>22nd, 1856.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="daisy.c26.p8"><s sid="12" id="daisy.c26.s12">However, the Roman camp had long been an object of their desires, and Margaret was glad that the last day should have a brilliancy, so she would not hear of any one remaining to keep her company, talked of the profit she should gain by a leisure day, and took ardent interest in every one's preparations and expectations, in Ethel's researches into county histories and classical dictionaries, Flora's sketching intentions, Norman's promises of campanula glomerata, and a secret whispered into her ear by Mary and Harry.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="daisy.c26.p11"><s sid="18" id="daisy.c26.s18">Snatches of song, peals of laughter, merry nonsense, passed from one to the other; Norman, roused into blitheness, found wit, the young ladies found laughter, and Richard's eyes and mouth looked very pretty, as they smiled their quiet diversion.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="daisy.c26.p12"><s sid="19" id="daisy.c26.s19">At last, his face drawn all into one silent laugh, he directed the eyes of the rest to a high green mound, rising immediately before them, where stood two little figures, one with a spy-glass, intently gazing the opposite way.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="daisy.c26.p13" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="daisy.c26.s20">At the same time came the halt, and Norman, bounding out, sprang lightly and nimbly up the side of the mound, and, while the spy-glass was yet pointed full at Wales, had hold of a pair of stout legs, and with the words, <qs/>"Keep a good lockout!"<qe/> had tumbled Mr. May headforemost down the grassy slope, with Mary rolling after.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="daisy.c26.p14"><s sid="21" id="daisy.c26.s21">Harry's first outcry was for his precious glass--his second was, not at his fall, but that they should have come from the east, when, by the compass, Stoneborough was north-north-west.</s> <s sid="22" id="daisy.c26.s22">And then the boys took to tumbling over one another, while Meta frolicked joyously, with Nipen after her, up and down the mounds, chased by Mary and Blanche, who were wild with glee.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="daisy.c26.p15"><s sid="23" id="daisy.c26.s23">By-and-by she joined Ethel, and Norman was summoned to help them to trace out the old lines of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates--happy work on those slopes of fresh turf, embroidered with every minute blossom of the moor--thyme, birdsfoot, eyebright, and dwarf purple thistle, buzzed and hummed over by busy, black-tailed, yellow-banded dumbledores, the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces, and the expanse of country--wooded hill, verdant pasture, amber harvest-field, winding river, smoke-canopied town, and brown moor, melting grayly away to the mountain heads.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="daisy.c26.p16"><s sid="24" id="daisy.c26.s24">Now in sun, now in shade, the bright young antiquaries surveyed the old banks, and talked wisely of vallum and fossa, of legion and cohort, of Agricola and Suetonius, and discussed the delightful probability, that this might have been raised in the war with Caractacus, whence, argued Ethel, since Caractacus was certainly Arviragus, it must have been the very spot where Imogen met Posthumus again.</s> <s sid="25" id="daisy.c26.s25">Was not yonder the very high-road to Milford Haven, and thus must not "fair Fidele's grassy tomb" be in the immediate neighbourhood?</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="daisy.c26.p17" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="daisy.c26.s26">Then followed the suggestion that the mound in the middle was a good deal like an ancient tomb, where, as Blanche interposed with some of the lore lately caught from Ethel's studies, <qs/>"they used to bury their tears in wheelbarrows,"<qe/> while Norman observed it was the more probable, as fair Fidele never was buried at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="daisy.c26.p18" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="daisy.c26.s27">The idea of a search enchanted the young ladies.</s> <s sid="28" id="daisy.c26.s28"><qs/>"It was the right sort of vehicle, evidently,"<qe/> said Norman, looking at Harry, who had been particularly earnest in recommending that it should be explored; and Meta declared that if they could but find the least trace, her papa would be delighted to go regularly to work, and reveal all the treasures.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="daisy.c26.p19"><s sid="29" id="daisy.c26.s29">Richard seemed a little afraid of the responsibility of treasure-trove, but he was overruled by a chorus of eager voices, and dispossessed of the trowel, which he had brought to dig up some down-gentians for the garden.</s> <s sid="30" id="daisy.c26.s30">While Norman set to work as pioneer, some skipped about in wild ecstasy, and Ethel knelt down to peer into the hole.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="daisy.c26.p25"><s sid="39" id="daisy.c26.s39">Flora and Ethel admired and speculated till there was a fresh, and still more exciting discovery--a coin, actually a medal, with the head of an emperor upon it--not a doubt of his high nose being Roman.</s> <s sid="40" id="daisy.c26.s40">Meta was certain that she knew one exactly like him among her father's gems.</s> <s sid="41" id="daisy.c26.s41">Ethel was resolved that he should be Claudius, and began decyphering the defaced inscription THVRVS.</s> <s sid="42" id="daisy.c26.s42">She tried Claudius's whole torrent of names, and, at last, made it into a contraction of Tiberius, which highly satisfied her.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="daisy.c26.p33"><s sid="56" id="daisy.c26.s56">Meta, enchanted with the joke, flew off to try to take in her governess and Mrs. Wilmot, whom she found completing their leisurely promenade, and considering where they should spread the dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="daisy.c26.p49"><s sid="74" id="daisy.c26.s74">The boy could not read writing, but he had his father's letter in his pocket, and Mary capered at the delightful coincidence, on finding that Jem Jennings was actually a quarter-master on board the Alcestis.</s> <s sid="75" id="daisy.c26.s75">It gave a sort of property in the boy, and she almost grudged Meta the having been first to say that she would pay for the rest of his journey, instead of doing it by subscription.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="daisy.c57.p2"><s sid="4" id="daisy.c57.s4">The wedding-day was fixed for the 20th of January, since it was less risk to Flora as an absolute invalid, than as convalescent enough to take any share in the doings.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="daisy.c57.p3"><s sid="5" id="daisy.c57.s5">Meta managed her correspondence with her own relatives, and obtained her uncle's kind approval, since he saw there could be nothing else; while her aunt treated her as an infatuated victim, but wished, for her mother's sake, to meet her in London before she sailed.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="daisy.c57.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="daisy.c57.s6">The worst stroke of all was to Bellairs, who had never chosen to believe that her mistress could move without her, and though mortally afraid in crossing to the Isle of Wight, and utterly abhorring all <qs/>"natives,"<qe/> went into hysterics on finding that her young lady would take out no maid but a little hard-working village girl; and though transferred in the most flattering manner to Mrs. Rivers's service, shed a tear for every stitch she set in the trousseau, and assured her betrothed butler that, if Miss Rivers would only have heard reason, she would have followed her to the world's end, rather than that her beautiful hair should never look like anything again.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="daisy.c57.p5"><s sid="7" id="daisy.c57.s7">So the wedding-day came, and grass and trees wore a fitting suit of crisp hoariness.</s> <s sid="8" id="daisy.c57.s8">Nothing could be quieter.</s> <s sid="9" id="daisy.c57.s9">Meta was arrayed by the sobbing Bellairs in her simple bridal white, wrapped herself in a large shawl, took her brother's arm, and walked down the frosty path with him and Mrs. Arnott, as if going merely to the daily service.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="daisy.c57.p6"><s sid="10" id="daisy.c57.s10">The time had not been made known, and there was hardly an addition to the ordinary congregation, except the May family and Dr. Spencer; but the Christmas evergreens still adorned aisle and chancel, and over the altar stood the motto that Meta herself had woven of holly, on that Christmas Eve of grief and anxiety, without knowing how it would speak to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="daisy.c57.p35" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="daisy.c57.s68"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/> said Flora hesitatingly; for she knew it was true--he liked to think himself important, and it gave him something to think of, and regular occupation--not too active or onerous; but she could not tell Ethel what she herself felt; that all she could do for him could not prevent him from being held cheap by the men among whom she had placed him.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="daisy.c57.p42" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="daisy.c57.s84"><qs/>"And this is our senator!"<qe/> thought Ethel.</s> <s sid="85" id="daisy.c57.s85"><qs/>"I wonder whether Honorius's hen was a Shanghai!</s> <s sid="86" id="daisy.c57.s86">Poor Flora is right--it is poor work to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear! but, putting him into the place is one thing, taking him out another.</s> <s sid="87" id="daisy.c57.s87">I wish she would take advice; but I never knew her do that, except as a civil way of communicating her intentions.</s> <s sid="88" id="daisy.c57.s88">However, she is not quite what she was!</s> <s sid="89" id="daisy.c57.s89">Poor dear!</s> <s sid="90" id="daisy.c57.s90">Aunt Flora will never believe what a beautiful creature she used to be!</s> <s sid="91" id="daisy.c57.s91">It seems wrong to think of her going back to that horrid London; but I can't judge.</s> <s sid="92" id="daisy.c57.s92">For my part, I'd rather do work, than no work for George, and he is a good, kind-hearted fellow after all!</s> <s sid="93" id="daisy.c57.s93">I won't be a crab!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="daisy.c57.p43"><s sid="94" id="daisy.c57.s94">So Ethel did her best, and said the cock had a bright eye--all she could say for him--and George instructed her to admire the awkward legs, and invited her to a poultry show, at Whitford, in two days' time--and they sent him away to continue his consultations with the poultry woman, which pullets should be preferred as candidates for a prize.</s> </p>
