<p pid="3" id="flopsy.c1.p3"><s sid="3" id="flopsy.c1.s3">They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="flopsy.c1.p4"><s sid="4" id="flopsy.c1.s4">When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy.</s> <s sid="5" id="flopsy.c1.s5">They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="flopsy.c1.p7"><s sid="8" id="flopsy.c1.s8">Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="flopsy.c1.p8"><s sid="9" id="flopsy.c1.s9">When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="flopsy.c1.p9"><s sid="10" id="flopsy.c1.s10">Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture.</s> <s sid="11" id="flopsy.c1.s11">There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.</s> <s sid="12" id="flopsy.c1.s12">One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had "shot" into flower.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="flopsy.c1.p10"><s sid="13" id="flopsy.c1.s13">The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces.</s> <s sid="14" id="flopsy.c1.s14">By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="flopsy.c1.p16"><s sid="23" id="flopsy.c1.s23">While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!</s> <s sid="24" id="flopsy.c1.s24">Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag.</s> <s sid="25" id="flopsy.c1.s25">The mouse hid in a jam pot.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="flopsy.c1.p17"><s sid="26" id="flopsy.c1.s26">The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="flopsy.c1.p27"><s sid="40" id="flopsy.c1.s40">Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="flopsy.c1.p28"><s sid="41" id="flopsy.c1.s41">Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.</s> </p>
