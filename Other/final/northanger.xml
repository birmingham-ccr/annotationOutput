<p pid="1" id="northanger.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="northanger.c1.s1">No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine.</s> <s sid="2" id="northanger.c1.s2">Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were all equally against her.</s> <s sid="3" id="northanger.c1.s3">Her father was a clergyman, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name was Richard--and he had never been handsome.</s> <s sid="4" id="northanger.c1.s4">He had a considerable independence besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters.</s> <s sid="5" id="northanger.c1.s5">Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution.</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c1.s6">She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see them growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c1.s7">A family of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c1.s8">She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features--so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c1.s9">She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush.</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c1.s10">Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take.</s> <s sid="11" id="northanger.c1.s11">Such were her propensities--her abilities were quite as extraordinary.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c1.s12">She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid.</s> <s sid="13" id="northanger.c1.s13">Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the "Beggar's Petition"; and after all, her next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did.</s> <s sid="14" id="northanger.c1.s14">Not that Catherine was always stupid--by no means; she learnt the fable of "The Hare and Many Friends" as quickly as any girl in England.</s> <s sid="15" id="northanger.c1.s15">Her mother wished her to learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight years old she began.</s> <s sid="16" id="northanger.c1.s16">She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off.</s> <s sid="17" id="northanger.c1.s17">The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life.</s> <s sid="18" id="northanger.c1.s18">Her taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another.</s> <s sid="19" id="northanger.c1.s19">Writing and accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could.</s> <s sid="20" id="northanger.c1.s20">What a strange, unaccountable character!--for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="northanger.c1.s21">Such was Catherine Morland at ten.</s> <s sid="22" id="northanger.c1.s22">At fifteen, appearances were mending; she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved, her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more animation, and her figure more consequence.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c1.s23">Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement.</s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c1.s24"><qs/>"Catherine grows quite a good-looking girl--she is almost pretty today,"<qe/> were words which caught her ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds!</s> <s sid="25" id="northanger.c1.s25">To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c1.p3"><s sid="26" id="northanger.c1.s26">Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children everything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books of information--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she had never any objection to books at all.</s> <s sid="27" id="northanger.c1.s27">But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="northanger.c1.p4"><s sid="28" id="northanger.c1.s28">From Pope, she learnt to censure those who</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="northanger.c1.p16"><s sid="40" id="northanger.c1.s40">So far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she came on exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could listen to other people's performance with very little fatigue.</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c1.s41">Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had no notion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover's profile, that she might be detected in the design.</s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c1.s42">There she fell miserably short of the true heroic height.</s> <s sid="43" id="northanger.c1.s43">At present she did not know her own poverty, for she had no lover to portray.</s> <s sid="44" id="northanger.c1.s44">She had reached the age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient.</s> <s sid="45" id="northanger.c1.s45">This was strange indeed!</s> <s sid="46" id="northanger.c1.s46">But strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out.</s> <s sid="47" id="northanger.c1.s47">There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet.</s> <s sid="48" id="northanger.c1.s48">There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door--not one young man whose origin was unknown.</s> <s sid="49" id="northanger.c1.s49">Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no children.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="northanger.c1.p17"><s sid="50" id="northanger.c1.s50">But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her.</s> <s sid="51" id="northanger.c1.s51">Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="northanger.c1.p18"><s sid="52" id="northanger.c1.s52">Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his lady, a good-humoured woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad, invited her to go with them.</s> <s sid="53" id="northanger.c1.s53">Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance, and Catherine all happiness.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER 2.</title>
<p pid="1" id="northanger.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="northanger.c2.s1">In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be stated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful and open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing, and, when in good looks, pretty--and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="northanger.c2.s2">When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe.</s> <s sid="3" id="northanger.c2.s3">A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet.</s> <s sid="4" id="northanger.c2.s4">Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve the fulness of her heart.</s> <s sid="5" id="northanger.c2.s5">Who would not think so?</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c2.s6">But Mrs. Morland knew so little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c2.s7">Her cautions were confined to the following points.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c2.s8"><qs/>"I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will give you this little book on purpose."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c2.p3"><s sid="9" id="northanger.c2.s9">Sally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?), must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister.</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c2.s10">It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted on Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce.</s> <s sid="11" id="northanger.c2.s11">Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the refined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c2.s12">Her father, instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an hundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and promised her more when she wanted it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="northanger.c2.p4"><s sid="13" id="northanger.c2.s13">Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the journey began.</s> <s sid="14" id="northanger.c2.s14">It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety.</s> <s sid="15" id="northanger.c2.s15">Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero.</s> <s sid="16" id="northanger.c2.s16">Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="northanger.c2.p5"><s sid="17" id="northanger.c2.s17">They arrived at Bath.</s> <s sid="18" id="northanger.c2.s18">Catherine was all eager delight--her eyes were here, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking environs, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel.</s> <s sid="19" id="northanger.c2.s19">She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c2.p6"><s sid="20" id="northanger.c2.s20">They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="northanger.c2.p7"><s sid="21" id="northanger.c2.s21">It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will, probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by her imprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her letters, ruining her character, or turning her out of doors.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="northanger.c2.p8"><s sid="22" id="northanger.c2.s22">Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c2.s23">She had neither beauty, genius, accomplishment, nor manner.</s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c2.s24">The air of a gentlewoman, a great deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible, intelligent man like Mr. Allen.</s> <s sid="25" id="northanger.c2.s25">In one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c2.s26">Dress was her passion.</s> <s sid="27" id="northanger.c2.s27">She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our heroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone was provided with a dress of the newest fashion.</s> <s sid="28" id="northanger.c2.s28">Catherine too made some purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms.</s> <s sid="29" id="northanger.c2.s29">Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care, and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do.</s> <s sid="30" id="northanger.c2.s30">With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd.</s> <s sid="31" id="northanger.c2.s31">As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it came, but she did not depend on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="northanger.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="northanger.c2.s32">Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late.</s> <s sid="33" id="northanger.c2.s33">The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could.</s> <s sid="34" id="northanger.c2.s34">As for Mr. Allen, he repaired directly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.</s> <s sid="35" id="northanger.c2.s35">With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine, however, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within her friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly.</s> <s sid="36" id="northanger.c2.s36">But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience.</s> <s sid="37" id="northanger.c2.s37">But this was far from being the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies.</s> <s sid="38" id="northanger.c2.s38">Still they moved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench.</s> <s sid="39" id="northanger.c2.s39">Here there was something less of crowd than below; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage through them.</s> <s sid="40" id="northanger.c2.s40">It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time that evening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she had not an acquaintance in the room.</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c2.s41">Mrs. Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, <qs/>"I wish you could dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner."<qe/></s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c2.s42">For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were repeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine grew tired at last, and would thank her no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="northanger.c2.p10"><s sid="43" id="northanger.c2.s43">They were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained.</s> <s sid="44" id="northanger.c2.s44">Everybody was shortly in motion for tea, and they must squeeze out like the rest.</s> <s sid="45" id="northanger.c2.s45">Catherine began to feel something of disappointment--she was tired of being continually pressed against by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in the tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them.</s> <s sid="46" id="northanger.c2.s46">They saw nothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at which a large party were already placed, without having anything to do there, or anybody to speak to, except each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="northanger.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="northanger.c2.s47">Mrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having preserved her gown from injury.</s> <s sid="48" id="northanger.c2.s48"><qs/>"It would have been very shocking to have it torn,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"would not it?</s> <s sid="49" id="northanger.c2.s49">It is such a delicate muslin.</s> <s sid="50" id="northanger.c2.s50">For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I assure you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="northanger.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="northanger.c2.s51"><qs/>"How uncomfortable it is,"<qe/><sss/> whispered Catherine, <sse/><qs/>"not to have a single acquaintance here!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="northanger.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="northanger.c2.s52"><qs/>"Yes, my dear,"<qe/><sls/> replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, <sle/><qs/>"it is very uncomfortable indeed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c4.p6"><s sid="17" id="northanger.c4.s17">The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of being considered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers, etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof of amity, she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and take a turn with her about the room.</s> <s sid="18" id="northanger.c4.s18">Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe.</s> <s sid="19" id="northanger.c4.s19">Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="northanger.c4.p7"><s sid="20" id="northanger.c4.s20">Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and quizzes.</s> <s sid="21" id="northanger.c4.s21">Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd.</s> <s sid="22" id="northanger.c4.s22">These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they were entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe's manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c4.s23">Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next morning.</s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c4.s24">Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe's progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the graceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and dress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had procured her such a friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="northanger.c4.p8"><s sid="25" id="northanger.c4.s25">Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was a good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c4.s26">Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by pretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her air, and dressing in the same style, did very well.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="northanger.c4.p9"><s sid="27" id="northanger.c4.s27">This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her past adventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had passed twenty years before, be minutely repeated.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="northanger.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="northanger.c5.s1">Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly claimed much of her leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach; but she looked in vain.</s> <s sid="2" id="northanger.c5.s2">Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room.</s> <s sid="3" id="northanger.c5.s3">She hoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c5.p2"><s sid="4" id="northanger.c5.s4">As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe the fresh air of better company.</s> <s sid="5" id="northanger.c5.s5">Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner.</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c5.s6">He was nowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful, in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c5.s7">His name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c5.s8">He must be gone from Bath.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c5.s9">Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short!</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c5.s10">This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him.</s> <s sid="11" id="northanger.c5.s11">From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c5.s12">It was a subject, however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken.</s> <s sid="13" id="northanger.c5.s13">Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return.</s> <s sid="14" id="northanger.c5.s14">She liked him the better for being a clergyman, "for she must confess herself very partial to the profession"; and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it.</s> <s sid="15" id="northanger.c5.s15">Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c5.p3" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="northanger.c5.s16">Mrs. Allen was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath.</s> <s sid="17" id="northanger.c5.s17">She had found some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself.</s> <s sid="18" id="northanger.c5.s18">Her daily expressions were no longer, <qs/>"I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath!"<qe/></s> <s sid="19" id="northanger.c5.s19">They were changed into, <qs/>"How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe!"<qe/> and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her gowns.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="northanger.c5.p4" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="northanger.c5.s20">The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves.</s> <s sid="21" id="northanger.c5.s21">They called each other by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned up each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together.</s> <s sid="22" id="northanger.c5.s22">Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding--joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c5.s23">Alas!</s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c5.s24">If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard?</s> <s sid="25" id="northanger.c5.s25">I cannot approve of it.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c5.s26">Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans.</s> <s sid="27" id="northanger.c5.s27">Let us not desert one another; we are an injured body.</s> <s sid="28" id="northanger.c5.s28">Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so much decried.</s> <s sid="29" id="northanger.c5.s29">From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers.</s> <s sid="30" id="northanger.c5.s30">And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them.</s> <s sid="31" id="northanger.c5.s31"><qs/>"I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not imagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel."<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="northanger.c5.s32">Such is the common cant.</s> <s sid="33" id="northanger.c5.s33"><qs/>"And what are you reading, Miss--?"<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="northanger.c5.s34"><qs/>"Oh!</s> <s sid="35" id="northanger.c5.s35">It is only a novel!"<qe/> replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame.</s> <s sid="36" id="northanger.c5.s36">"It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda"; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.</s> <s sid="37" id="northanger.c5.s37">Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c8.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="northanger.c8.s3">The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and James, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too.</s> <s sid="4" id="northanger.c8.s4"><qs/>"I assure you,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening."<qe/></s> <s sid="5" id="northanger.c8.s5">Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to his sister and whispered, <qs/>"My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out."<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c8.s6">Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand and say, <qs/>"Good-bye, my dear love,"<qe/> before they hurried off.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c8.s7">The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c8.s8">She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c8.s9">To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character.</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c8.s10">Catherine had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c8.p3"><s sid="11" id="northanger.c8.s11">From this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr. Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be moving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and the blush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away without sullying her heroic importance.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c8.s12">He looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by being married already.</s> <s sid="13" id="northanger.c8.s13">But guided only by what was simple and probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had not behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had been used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.</s> <s sid="14" id="northanger.c8.s14">From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister's now being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat erect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little redder than usual.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="northanger.c8.p11"><s sid="39" id="northanger.c8.s39">Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable countenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension, the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance.</s> <s sid="40" id="northanger.c8.s40">Her manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor affectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her, and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence.</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c8.s41">Catherine, interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous of being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying it.</s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c8.s42">But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or played, or sang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c9.p6" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="northanger.c9.s25">Catherine's silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown away, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe, as Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to speak plainer.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c9.s26"><qs/>"Well, ma'am, what do you say to it?</s> <s sid="27" id="northanger.c9.s27">Can you spare me for an hour or two?</s> <s sid="28" id="northanger.c9.s28">Shall I go?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="northanger.c9.p8" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="northanger.c9.s35">Catherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James, <qs/>"What a sweet girl she is!</s> <s sid="36" id="northanger.c9.s36">I quite dote on her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="northanger.c9.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="northanger.c9.s37"><qs/>"You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,"<qe/><sls/> said Thorpe, as he handed her in, <sle/><qs/>"if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.</s> <s sid="38" id="northanger.c9.s38">He will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest for a minute; but he will soon know his master.</s> <s sid="39" id="northanger.c9.s39">He is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there is no vice in him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="northanger.c9.p10" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="northanger.c9.s40">Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too late to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened; so, resigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal's boasted knowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down by her.</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c9.s41">Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the horse's head was bid in an important voice <qs/>"to let him go,"<qe/> and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or anything like one.</s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c9.s42">Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip.</s> <s sid="43" id="northanger.c9.s43">Catherine, though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and (considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February, with the consciousness of safety.</s> <s sid="44" id="northanger.c9.s44">A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying very abruptly, <qs/>"Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not he?"<qe/></s> <s sid="45" id="northanger.c9.s45">Catherine did not understand him--and he repeated his question, adding in explanation, <qs/>"Old Allen, the man you are with."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c13.p2" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="northanger.c13.s17"><qs/>"No, it would not be easy.</s> <s sid="18" id="northanger.c13.s18">I could not do it.</s> <s sid="19" id="northanger.c13.s19">There has been no prior engagement."<qe/></s> <s sid="20" id="northanger.c13.s20">But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most endearing names.</s> <s sid="21" id="northanger.c13.s21">She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly.</s> <s sid="22" id="northanger.c13.s22">She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c13.s23">But all in vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to influence her.</s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c13.s24">Isabella then tried another method.</s> <s sid="25" id="northanger.c13.s25">She reproached her with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her so little a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being grown cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c13.s26"><qs/>"I cannot help being jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively!</s> <s sid="27" id="northanger.c13.s27">When once my affections are placed, it is not in the power of anything to change them.</s> <s sid="28" id="northanger.c13.s28">But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick, I own.</s> <s sid="29" id="northanger.c13.s29">These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c13.p3" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="northanger.c13.s30">Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind.</s> <s sid="31" id="northanger.c13.s31">Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?</s> <s sid="32" id="northanger.c13.s32">Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of everything but her own gratification.</s> <s sid="33" id="northanger.c13.s33">These painful ideas crossed her mind, though she said nothing.</s> <s sid="34" id="northanger.c13.s34">Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied her handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight, could not help saying, <qs/>"Nay, Catherine.</s> <s sid="35" id="northanger.c13.s35">I think you cannot stand out any longer now.</s> <s sid="36" id="northanger.c13.s36">The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="northanger.c13.p4" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="northanger.c13.s37">This was the first time of her brother's openly siding against her, and anxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise.</s> <s sid="38" id="northanger.c13.s38">If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily do, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, and everybody might then be satisfied.</s> <s sid="39" id="northanger.c13.s39">But <qs/>"No, no, no!"<qe/><sss/> was the immediate answer; <sse/><qs/>"that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday."<qe/></s> <s sid="40" id="northanger.c13.s40">Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of cold resentment said, <qs/>"Very well, then there is an end of the party.</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c13.s41">If Catherine does not go, I cannot.</s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c13.s42">I cannot be the only woman.</s> <s sid="43" id="northanger.c13.s43">I would not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="northanger.c13.p5" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="northanger.c13.s44"><qs/>"Catherine, you must go,"<qe/> said James.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c13.p6" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="northanger.c13.s45"><qs/>"But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters?</s> <s sid="46" id="northanger.c13.s46">I dare say either of them would like to go."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="northanger.c13.p7" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="northanger.c13.s47"><qs/>"Thank ye,"<qe/><sss/> cried Thorpe, <sse/><qs/>"but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about, and look like a fool.</s> <s sid="48" id="northanger.c13.s48">No, if you do not go, d---- me if I do.</s> <s sid="49" id="northanger.c13.s49">I only go for the sake of driving you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="northanger.c13.p8" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="northanger.c13.s50"><qs/>"That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure."<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="northanger.c13.s51">But her words were lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="northanger.c13.p9"><s sid="52" id="northanger.c13.s52">The three others still continued together, walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said, sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and her arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts were at war.</s> <s sid="53" id="northanger.c13.s53">At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; always distressed, but always steady.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="northanger.c13.p10" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="northanger.c13.s54"><qs/>"I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,"<qe/><sss/> said James; <sse/><qs/>"you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest, best-tempered of my sisters."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="northanger.c13.p11" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="northanger.c13.s55"><qs/>"I hope I am not less so now,"<qe/><sss/> she replied, very feelingly; <sse/><qs/>"but indeed I cannot go.</s> <s sid="56" id="northanger.c13.s56">If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="northanger.c13.p12" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="northanger.c13.s57"><qs/>"I suspect,"<qe/><sls/> said Isabella, in a low voice, <sle/><qs/>"there is no great struggle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="northanger.c13.p13" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="northanger.c13.s58">Catherine's heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made no opposition.</s> <s sid="59" id="northanger.c13.s59">Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined by Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, <qs/>"Well, I have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience.</s> <s sid="60" id="northanger.c13.s60">I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="northanger.c13.p14" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="northanger.c13.s61"><qs/>"You have not!"<qe/> cried Catherine.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="northanger.c13.p15" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="northanger.c13.s62"><qs/>"I have, upon my soul.</s> <s sid="63" id="northanger.c13.s63">Left her this moment.</s> <s sid="64" id="northanger.c13.s64">Told her you had sent me to say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday.</s> <s sid="65" id="northanger.c13.s65">She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her; so there is an end of all our difficulties.</s> <s sid="66" id="northanger.c13.s66">A pretty good thought of mine--hey?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="northanger.c13.p16"><s sid="67" id="northanger.c13.s67">Isabella's countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and James too looked happy again.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="northanger.c13.p17" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="northanger.c13.s68"><qs/>"A most heavenly thought indeed!</s> <s sid="69" id="northanger.c13.s69">Now, my sweet Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a most delightful party."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="northanger.c13.p18" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="northanger.c13.s70"><qs/>"This will not do,"<qe/><sss/> said Catherine; <sse/><qs/>"I cannot submit to this.</s> <s sid="71" id="northanger.c13.s71">I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="northanger.c13.p19"><s sid="72" id="northanger.c13.s72">Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and remonstrances poured in from all three.</s> <s sid="73" id="northanger.c13.s73">Even James was quite angry.</s> <s sid="74" id="northanger.c13.s74">When everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would suit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any further objection.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="northanger.c13.p20" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="northanger.c13.s75"><qs/>"I do not care.</s> <s sid="76" id="northanger.c13.s76">Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.</s> <s sid="77" id="northanger.c13.s77">If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself.</s> <s sid="78" id="northanger.c13.s78">This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has--He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday.</s> <s sid="79" id="northanger.c13.s79">Let me go, Mr. Thorpe; Isabella, do not hold me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="northanger.c13.p21"><s sid="80" id="northanger.c13.s80">Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were turning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, and were at home by this time.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="northanger.c13.p22" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="northanger.c13.s81"><qs/>"Then I will go after them,"<qe/><sss/> said Catherine; <sse/><qs/>"wherever they are I will go after them.</s> <s sid="82" id="northanger.c13.s82">It does not signify talking.</s> <s sid="83" id="northanger.c13.s83">If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it."<qe/></s> <s sid="84" id="northanger.c13.s84">And with these words she broke away and hurried off.</s> <s sid="85" id="northanger.c13.s85">Thorpe would have darted after her, but Morland withheld him.</s> <s sid="86" id="northanger.c13.s86"><qs/>"Let her go, let her go, if she will go."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="northanger.c13.p24"><s sid="88" id="northanger.c13.s88">Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a proper one.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="northanger.c13.p25" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="northanger.c13.s89">Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would permit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere.</s> <s sid="90" id="northanger.c13.s90">As she walked, she reflected on what had passed.</s> <s sid="91" id="northanger.c13.s91">It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother; but she could not repent her resistance.</s> <s sid="92" id="northanger.c13.s92">Setting her own inclination apart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before, and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong.</s> <s sid="93" id="northanger.c13.s93">She had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consulted merely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she had attended to what was due to others, and to her own character in their opinion.</s> <s sid="94" id="northanger.c13.s94">Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough to restore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could not be at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent, she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsom Street.</s> <s sid="95" id="northanger.c13.s95">So rapid had been her movements that in spite of the Tilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into their lodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant still remaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of saying that she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him proceeded upstairs.</s> <s sid="96" id="northanger.c13.s96">Then, opening the first door before her, which happened to be the right, she immediately found herself in the drawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter.</s> <s sid="97" id="northanger.c13.s97">Her explanation, defective only in being--from her irritation of nerves and shortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given.</s> <s sid="98" id="northanger.c13.s98"><qs/>"I am come in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--I told them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stay for the servant."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="northanger.c13.p26"><s sid="99" id="northanger.c13.s99">The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech, soon ceased to be a puzzle.</s> <s sid="100" id="northanger.c13.s100">Catherine found that John Thorpe had given the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it.</s> <s sid="101" id="northanger.c13.s101">But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of knowing.</s> <s sid="102" id="northanger.c13.s102">Whatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="northanger.c13.p27" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="northanger.c13.s103">The affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe's information to her mind, and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on.</s> <s sid="104" id="northanger.c13.s104">To such anxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself.</s> <s sid="105" id="northanger.c13.s105"><qs/>"What did William mean by it?</s> <s sid="106" id="northanger.c13.s106">He should make a point of inquiring into the matter."<qe/></s> <s sid="107" id="northanger.c13.s107">And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="northanger.c13.p28" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="northanger.c13.s108">After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave, and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her.</s> <s sid="109" id="northanger.c13.s109">Miss Tilney added her own wishes.</s> <s sid="110" id="northanger.c13.s110">Catherine was greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power.</s> <s sid="111" id="northanger.c13.s111">Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect her back every moment.</s> <s sid="112" id="northanger.c13.s112">The general declared he could say no more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on some other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would not refuse to spare her to her friend.</s> <s sid="113" id="northanger.c13.s113"><qs/>"Oh, no; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasure in coming."<qe/></s> <s sid="114" id="northanger.c13.s114">The general attended her himself to the street-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of her walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they parted.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="northanger.c13.p29" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="northanger.c13.s115">Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before.</s> <s sid="116" id="northanger.c13.s116">She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party; and now that she had been triumphant throughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her walk, she began (as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right.</s> <s sid="117" id="northanger.c13.s117">A sacrifice was always noble; and if she had given way to their entreaties, she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through her means.</s> <s sid="118" id="northanger.c13.s118">To ease her mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day.</s> <s sid="119" id="northanger.c13.s119">Mr. Allen caught at it directly.</s> <s sid="120" id="northanger.c13.s120"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"and do you think of going too?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="northanger.c13.p30" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="northanger.c13.s121"><qs/>"No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="northanger.c13.p31" type="speech"><s sid="122" id="northanger.c13.s122"><qs/>"No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it.</s> <s sid="123" id="northanger.c13.s123">These schemes are not at all the thing.</s> <s sid="124" id="northanger.c13.s124">Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages!</s> <s sid="125" id="northanger.c13.s125">Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together!</s> <s sid="126" id="northanger.c13.s126">It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it.</s> <s sid="127" id="northanger.c13.s127">I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased.</s> <s sid="128" id="northanger.c13.s128">Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking?</s> <s sid="129" id="northanger.c13.s129">Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c20.p2"><s sid="4" id="northanger.c20.s4">Miss Tilney's manners and Henry's smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings; but still she was far from being at ease; nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her.</s> <s sid="5" id="northanger.c20.s5">Nay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have felt less, had she been less attended to.</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c20.s6">His anxiety for her comfort--his continual solicitations that she would eat, and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste--though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table--made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c20.s7">She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c20.s8">Her tranquillity was not improved by the general's impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c20.s9">She was quite pained by the severity of his father's reproof, which seemed disproportionate to the offence; and much was her concern increased when she found herself the principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her.</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c20.s10">This was placing her in a very uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for Captain Tilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c20.p3" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="northanger.c20.s11">He listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence, which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, on Isabella's account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been the real cause of his rising late.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c20.s12">It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spirits affected, she could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to Eleanor, <qs/>"How glad I shall be when you are all off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="northanger.c21.p5" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="northanger.c21.s34">Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch.</s> <s sid="35" id="northanger.c21.s35">Miss Tilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General Tilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having, on the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence, ordered <qs/>"Dinner to be on table directly!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="northanger.c21.p8"><s sid="43" id="northanger.c21.s43">The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the occasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness.</s> <s sid="44" id="northanger.c21.s44">It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or restraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she could think of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="northanger.c23.p16"><s sid="63" id="northanger.c23.s63">But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose.</s> <s sid="64" id="northanger.c23.s64">To be kept up for hours, after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.</s> <s sid="65" id="northanger.c23.s65">There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs. Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the pitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the conclusion which necessarily followed.</s> <s sid="66" id="northanger.c23.s66">Shocking as was the idea, it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural course of things, she must ere long be released.</s> <s sid="67" id="northanger.c23.s67">The suddenness of her reputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her other children, at the time--all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment.</s> <s sid="68" id="northanger.c23.s68">Its origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to be unravelled.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="northanger.c24.p1"><s sid="1" id="northanger.c24.s1">The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments.</s> <s sid="2" id="northanger.c24.s2">It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp.</s> <s sid="3" id="northanger.c24.s3">The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew.</s> <s sid="4" id="northanger.c24.s4">By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by the inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her destroyer, affected her even to tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c24.p2"><s sid="5" id="northanger.c24.s5">That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so fearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemed wonderful to Catherine.</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c24.s6">Not, however, that many instances of beings equally hardened in guilt might not be produced.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c24.s7">She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c24.s8">The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c24.s9">Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed--what could it avail in such a case?</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c24.s10">Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="northanger.c24.p5"><s sid="28" id="northanger.c24.s28">In the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolution of making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone.</s> <s sid="29" id="northanger.c24.s29">It would be much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter.</s> <s sid="30" id="northanger.c24.s30">To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend.</s> <s sid="31" id="northanger.c24.s31">The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might be to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any companion.</s> <s sid="32" id="northanger.c24.s32">It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she therefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general's cruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she felt confident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the last gasp.</s> <s sid="33" id="northanger.c24.s33">Of the way to the apartment she was now perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry's return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost.</s> <s sid="34" id="northanger.c24.s34">The day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c24.p6" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="northanger.c24.s35">It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike.</s> <s sid="36" id="northanger.c24.s36">It was no time for thought; she hurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in question.</s> <s sid="37" id="northanger.c24.s37">The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being.</s> <s sid="38" id="northanger.c24.s38">On tiptoe she entered; the room was before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance another step.</s> <s sid="39" id="northanger.c24.s39">She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature.</s> <s sid="40" id="northanger.c24.s40">She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows!</s> <s sid="41" id="northanger.c24.s41">Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were.</s> <s sid="42" id="northanger.c24.s42">Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame.</s> <s sid="43" id="northanger.c24.s43">She could not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!--in Miss Tilney's meaning, in her own calculation!</s> <s sid="44" id="northanger.c24.s44">This apartment, to which she had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end of what the general's father had built.</s> <s sid="45" id="northanger.c24.s45">There were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had no inclination to open either.</s> <s sid="46" id="northanger.c24.s46">Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?</s> <s sid="47" id="northanger.c24.s47">No: whatever might have been the general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection.</s> <s sid="48" id="northanger.c24.s48">She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her own room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was on the point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble.</s> <s sid="49" id="northanger.c24.s49">To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the general (and he seemed always at hand when least wanted), much worse!</s> <s sid="50" id="northanger.c24.s50">She listened--the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a moment, she passed through and closed the door.</s> <s sid="51" id="northanger.c24.s51">At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she could gain the gallery.</s> <s sid="52" id="northanger.c24.s52">She had no power to move.</s> <s sid="53" id="northanger.c24.s53">With a feeling of terror not very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her view.</s> <s sid="54" id="northanger.c24.s54"><qs/>"Mr. Tilney!"<qe/> she exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment.</s> <s sid="55" id="northanger.c24.s55">He looked astonished too.</s> <s sid="56" id="northanger.c24.s56"><qs/>"Good God!"<qe/> she continued, not attending to his address.</s> <s sid="57" id="northanger.c24.s57"><qs/>"How came you here?</s> <s sid="58" id="northanger.c24.s58">How came you up that staircase?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="northanger.c30.p10"><s sid="38" id="northanger.c30.s38">A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random, without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of her own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed them to the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to close, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parental authority in his present application.</s> <s sid="39" id="northanger.c30.s39">On his return from Woodston, two days before, he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father, hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and ordered to think of her no more.</s> </p>

and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made him believe them.</s> <s sid="49" id="northanger.c30.s49">With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected, his own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune.</s> <s sid="50" id="northanger.c30.s50">The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland's preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and sinking half the children, he was able to represent the whole family to the general in a most respectable light.</s> <s sid="51" id="northanger.c30.s51">For Catherine, however, the peculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his own speculations, he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen's estate.</s> <s sid="52" id="northanger.c30.s52">Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed.</s> <s sid="53" id="northanger.c30.s53">Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never had it occurred to him to doubt its authority.</s> <s sid="54" id="northanger.c30.s54">Thorpe's interest in the family, by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members, and his own views on another (circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness), seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and--as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to judge--of their treating her with parental kindness.</s> <s sid="55" id="northanger.c30.s55">His resolution was soon formed.</s> <s sid="56" id="northanger.c30.s56">Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe's communication, he almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearest hopes.</s> <s sid="57" id="northanger.c30.s57">Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children.</s> <s sid="58" id="northanger.c30.s58">Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power to attach her, Henry was convinced of his father's believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried him on.</s> <s sid="59" id="northanger.c30.s59">That they were false, the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before to the advantage of the Morlands--confessed himself to have been totally mistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by the rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support.</s> <s sid="60" id="northanger.c30.s60">They were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means respected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had particular opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="northanger.c30.p13"><s sid="61" id="northanger.c30.s61">The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error.</s> <s sid="62" id="northanger.c30.s62">The Allens, he believed, had lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve.</s> <s sid="63" id="northanger.c30.s63">The general needed no more.</s> <s sid="64" id="northanger.c30.s64">Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the next day for the abbey, where his performances have been seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="northanger.c30.p14"><s sid="65" id="northanger.c30.s65">I leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how much of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his own conjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James.</s> <s sid="66" id="northanger.c30.s66">I have united for their ease what they must divide for mine.</s> <s sid="67" id="northanger.c30.s67">Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife, she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="northanger.c30.p15"><s sid="68" id="northanger.c30.s68">Henry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself.</s> <s sid="69" id="northanger.c30.s69">He blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose.</s> <s sid="70" id="northanger.c30.s70">The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind.</s> <s sid="71" id="northanger.c30.s71">Henry's indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending his father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had been open and bold.</s> <s sid="72" id="northanger.c30.s72">The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it.</s> <s sid="73" id="northanger.c30.s73">But, in such a cause, his anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was sustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice.</s> <s sid="74" id="northanger.c30.s74">He felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing that heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="northanger.c30.p16"><s sid="75" id="northanger.c30.s75">He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand.</s> <s sid="76" id="northanger.c30.s76">The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadful disagreement.</s> <s sid="77" id="northanger.c30.s77">Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston, and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey to Fullerton.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="northanger.c31.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="northanger.c31.s1">Mr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for their consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes, considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more natural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start.</s> <s sid="2" id="northanger.c31.s2">His pleasing manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having never heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told.</s> <s sid="3" id="northanger.c31.s3">Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his character needed no attestation.</s> <s sid="4" id="northanger.c31.s4"><qs/>"Catherine would make a sad, heedless young housekeeper to be sure,"<qe/> was her mother's foreboding remark; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="northanger.c31.p2"><s sid="5" id="northanger.c31.s5">There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement.</s> <s sid="6" id="northanger.c31.s6">Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allow themselves to encourage it.</s> <s sid="7" id="northanger.c31.s7">That the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it, they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once obtained--and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be very long denied--their willing approbation was instantly to follow.</s> <s sid="8" id="northanger.c31.s8">His consent was all that they wished for.</s> <s sid="9" id="northanger.c31.s9">They were no more inclined than entitled to demand his money.</s> <s sid="10" id="northanger.c31.s10">Of a very considerable fortune, his son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="northanger.c31.p3"><s sid="11" id="northanger.c31.s11">The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this.</s> <s sid="12" id="northanger.c31.s12">They felt and they deplored--but they could not resent it; and they parted, endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in the fullness of privileged affection.</s> <s sid="13" id="northanger.c31.s13">Henry returned to what was now his only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend his improvements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked anxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry.</s> <s sid="14" id="northanger.c31.s14">Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let us not inquire.</s> <s sid="15" id="northanger.c31.s15">Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--they had been too kind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="northanger.c31.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="northanger.c31.s19">The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home of her choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all her acquaintance.</s> <s sid="20" id="northanger.c31.s20">My own joy on the occasion is very sincere.</s> <s sid="21" id="northanger.c31.s21">I know no one more entitled, by unpretending merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy felicity.</s> <s sid="22" id="northanger.c31.s22">Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing her.</s> <s sid="23" id="northanger.c31.s23">His unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all his difficulties; and never had the general loved his daughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patient endurance as when he first hailed her <qs/>"Your Ladyship!"<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="northanger.c31.s24">Her husband was really deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, and his attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the world.</s> <s sid="25" id="northanger.c31.s25">Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all.</s> <s sid="26" id="northanger.c31.s26">Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to add--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable--that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="northanger.c31.p6"><s sid="27" id="northanger.c31.s27">The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances which, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they were qualified to give.</s> <s sid="28" id="northanger.c31.s28">It taught him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="29" id="northanger.c31.s29">This was so material an amendment of his late expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was at some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every greedy speculation.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="northanger.c31.p7"><s sid="30" id="northanger.c31.s30">On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage, permitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him the bearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland.</s> <s sid="31" id="northanger.c31.s31">The event which it authorized soon followed:</s> <s sid="32" id="northanger.c31.s32">Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it.</s> <s sid="33" id="northanger.c31.s33">To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.</s> </p>
