<title>PART I. CHAPTER 1. My Early Home</title>
<p pid="1" id="beauty.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="beauty.c1.s1">The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it.</s> <s sid="2" id="beauty.c1.s2">Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end.</s> <s sid="3" id="beauty.c1.s3">Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which stood by the roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="beauty.c1.s4">While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass.</s> <s sid="5" id="beauty.c1.s5">In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her.</s> <s sid="6" id="beauty.c1.s6">When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="beauty.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="beauty.c1.s7">As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and come back in the evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="beauty.c1.s8">There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c1.s9">I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c1.s10">Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="beauty.c1.p5"><s sid="11" id="beauty.c1.s11">One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="beauty.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="beauty.c1.s12"><qs/>"I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you.</s> <s sid="13" id="beauty.c1.s13">The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners.</s> <s sid="14" id="beauty.c1.s14">You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite.</s> <s sid="15" id="beauty.c1.s15">I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="beauty.c1.p7"><s sid="16" id="beauty.c1.s16">I have never forgotten my mother's advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.</s> <s sid="17" id="beauty.c1.s17">Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="beauty.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="beauty.c1.s18">Our master was a good, kind man.</s> <s sid="19" id="beauty.c1.s19">He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children.</s> <s sid="20" id="beauty.c1.s20">We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much.</s> <s sid="21" id="beauty.c1.s21">When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him.</s> <s sid="22" id="beauty.c1.s22">He would pat and stroke her and say, <qs/>"Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?"<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="beauty.c1.s23">I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother.</s> <s sid="24" id="beauty.c1.s24">All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favorites.</s> <s sid="25" id="beauty.c1.s25">My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="beauty.c1.p9"><s sid="26" id="beauty.c1.s26">There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge.</s> <s sid="27" id="beauty.c1.s27">When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop.</s> <s sid="28" id="beauty.c1.s28">We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="beauty.c1.p10"><s sid="29" id="beauty.c1.s29">One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise.</s> <s sid="30" id="beauty.c1.s30">As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="beauty.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="beauty.c1.s31"><qs/>"Bad boy!"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"bad boy! to chase the colts.</s> <s sid="32" id="beauty.c1.s32">This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last.</s> <s sid="33" id="beauty.c1.s33">There--take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again."<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="beauty.c1.s34">So we never saw Dick any more.</s> <s sid="35" id="beauty.c1.s35">Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.</s> </p>

<title>PART I. CHAPTER 2. The Hunt</title>
<p pid="1" id="beauty.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="beauty.c2.s1">Before I was two years old a circumstance happened which I have never forgotten.</s> <s sid="2" id="beauty.c2.s2">It was early in the spring; there had been a little frost in the night, and a light mist still hung over the woods and meadows.</s> <s sid="3" id="beauty.c2.s3">I and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when we heard, quite in the distance, what sounded like the cry of dogs.</s> <s sid="4" id="beauty.c2.s4">The oldest of the colts raised his head, pricked his ears, and said, <qs/>"There are the hounds!"<qe/> and immediately cantered off, followed by the rest of us to the upper part of the field, where we could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond.</s> <s sid="5" id="beauty.c2.s5">My mother and an old riding horse of our master's were also standing near, and seemed to know all about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="beauty.c2.s6"><qs/>"They have found a hare,"<qe/><sss/> said my mother, <sse/><qs/>"and if they come this way we shall see the hunt."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="beauty.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="beauty.c2.s7">And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours.</s> <s sid="8" id="beauty.c2.s8">I never heard such a noise as they made.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c2.s9">They did not bark, nor howl, nor whine, but kept on a <qs/>"yo! yo, o, o! yo! yo, o, o!"<qe/> at the top of their voices.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c2.s10">After them came a number of men on horseback, some of them in green coats, all galloping as fast as they could.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c2.s11">The old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them, and we young colts wanted to be galloping with them, but they were soon away into the fields lower down; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand; the dogs left off barking, and ran about every way with their noses to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="beauty.c2.s12"><qs/>"They have lost the scent,"<qe/><sss/> said the old horse; <sse/><qs/>"perhaps the hare will get off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="beauty.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="beauty.c2.s13"><qs/>"What hare?"<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="beauty.c2.s14">I said.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="beauty.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="beauty.c2.s15"><qs/>"Oh!</s> <s sid="16" id="beauty.c2.s16">I don't know what hare; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the woods; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after;"<qe/><sls/> and before long the dogs began their <sle/><qs/>"yo! yo, o, o!"<qe/> again, and back they came altogether at full speed, making straight for our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="beauty.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="beauty.c2.s17"><qs/>"Now we shall see the hare,"<qe/> said my mother; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by and made for the woods.</s> <s sid="18" id="beauty.c2.s18">On came the dogs; they burst over the bank, leaped the stream, and came dashing across the field followed by the huntsmen.</s> <s sid="19" id="beauty.c2.s19">Six or eight men leaped their horses clean over, close upon the dogs.</s> <s sid="20" id="beauty.c2.s20">The hare tried to get through the fence; it was too thick, and she turned sharp round to make for the road, but it was too late; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries; we heard one shriek, and that was the end of her.</s> <s sid="21" id="beauty.c2.s21">One of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs, who would soon have torn her to pieces.</s> <s sid="22" id="beauty.c2.s22">He held her up by the leg torn and bleeding, and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="beauty.c2.p8"><s sid="23" id="beauty.c2.s23">As for me, I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was going on by the brook; but when I did look there was a sad sight; two fine horses were down, one was struggling in the stream, and the other was groaning on the grass.</s> <s sid="24" id="beauty.c2.s24">One of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud, the other lay quite still.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="beauty.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="beauty.c2.s25"><qs/>"His neck is broke,"<qe/> said my mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="beauty.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="beauty.c2.s26"><qs/>"And serve him right, too,"<qe/> said one of the colts.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="beauty.c2.p11"><s sid="27" id="beauty.c2.s27">I thought the same, but my mother did not join with us.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="beauty.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="beauty.c2.s28"><qs/>"Well, no,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"you must not say that; but though I am an old horse, and have seen and heard a great deal, I never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport; they often hurt themselves, often spoil good horses, and tear up the fields, and all for a hare or a fox, or a stag, that they could get more easily some other way; but we are only horses, and don't know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="beauty.c2.p13"><s sid="29" id="beauty.c2.s29">While my mother was saying this we stood and looked on.</s> <s sid="30" id="beauty.c2.s30">Many of the riders had gone to the young man; but my master, who had been watching what was going on, was the first to raise him.</s> <s sid="31" id="beauty.c2.s31">His head fell back and his arms hung down, and every one looked very serious.</s> <s sid="32" id="beauty.c2.s32">There was no noise now; even the dogs were quiet, and seemed to know that something was wrong.</s> <s sid="33" id="beauty.c2.s33">They carried him to our master's house.</s> <s sid="34" id="beauty.c2.s34">I heard afterward that it was young George Gordon, the squire's only son, a fine, tall young man, and the pride of his family.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="beauty.c2.p14"><s sid="35" id="beauty.c2.s35">There was now riding off in all directions to the doctor's, to the farrier's, and no doubt to Squire Gordon's, to let him know about his son.</s> <s sid="36" id="beauty.c2.s36">When Mr. Bond, the farrier, came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass, he felt him all over, and shook his head; one of his legs was broken.</s> <s sid="37" id="beauty.c2.s37">Then some one ran to our master's house and came back with a gun; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek, and then all was still; the black horse moved no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="beauty.c2.p15"><s sid="38" id="beauty.c2.s38">My mother seemed much troubled; she said she had known that horse for years, and that his name was "Rob Roy"; he was a good horse, and there was no vice in him.</s> <s sid="39" id="beauty.c2.s39">She never would go to that part of the field afterward.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="beauty.c2.p16"><s sid="40" id="beauty.c2.s40">Not many days after we heard the church-bell tolling for a long time, and looking over the gate we saw a long, strange black coach that was covered with black cloth and was drawn by black horses; after that came another and another and another, and all were black, while the bell kept tolling, tolling.</s> <s sid="41" id="beauty.c2.s41">They were carrying young Gordon to the churchyard to bury him.</s> <s sid="42" id="beauty.c2.s42">He would never ride again.</s> <s sid="43" id="beauty.c2.s43">What they did with Rob Roy I never knew; but 'twas all for one little hare.</s> </p>

<title>PART I. CHAPTER 3. My Breaking In</title>
<p pid="1" id="beauty.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="beauty.c3.s1">I was now beginning to grow handsome; my coat had grown fine and soft, and was bright black.</s> <s sid="2" id="beauty.c3.s2">I had one white foot and a pretty white star on my forehead.</s> <s sid="3" id="beauty.c3.s3">I was thought very handsome; my master would not sell me till I was four years old; he said lads ought not to work like men, and colts ought not to work like horses till they were quite grown up.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="beauty.c3.s4">When I was four years old Squire Gordon came to look at me.</s> <s sid="5" id="beauty.c3.s5">He examined my eyes, my mouth, and my legs; he felt them all down; and then I had to walk and trot and gallop before him.</s> <s sid="6" id="beauty.c3.s6">He seemed to like me, and said, <qs/>"When he has been well broken in he will do very well."<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="beauty.c3.s7">My master said he would break me in himself, as he should not like me to be frightened or hurt, and he lost no time about it, for the next day he began.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="beauty.c3.p3"><s sid="8" id="beauty.c3.s8">Every one may not know what breaking in is, therefore I will describe it.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c3.s9">It means to teach a horse to wear a saddle and bridle, and to carry on his back a man, woman or child; to go just the way they wish, and to go quietly.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c3.s10">Besides this he has to learn to wear a collar, a crupper, and a breeching, and to stand still while they are put on; then to have a cart or a chaise fixed behind, so that he cannot walk or trot without dragging it after him; and he must go fast or slow, just as his driver wishes.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c3.s11">He must never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses, nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own; but always do his master's will, even though he may be very tired or hungry; but the worst of all is, when his harness is once on, he may neither jump for joy nor lie down for weariness.</s> <s sid="12" id="beauty.c3.s12">So you see this breaking in is a great thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c3.p4"><s sid="13" id="beauty.c3.s13">I had of course long been used to a halter and a headstall, and to be led about in the fields and lanes quietly, but now I was to have a bit and bridle; my master gave me some oats as usual, and after a good deal of coaxing he got the bit into my mouth, and the bridle fixed, but it was a nasty thing!</s> <s sid="14" id="beauty.c3.s14">Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot think how bad it feels; a great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger to be pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth, and over one's tongue, with the ends coming out at the corner of your mouth, and held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin; so that no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing; it is very bad! yes, very bad! at least I thought so; but I knew my mother always wore one when she went out, and all horses did when they were grown up; and so, what with the nice oats, and what with my master's pats, kind words, and gentle ways, I got to wear my bit and bridle.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="beauty.c3.p5"><s sid="15" id="beauty.c3.s15">Next came the saddle, but that was not half so bad; my master put it on my back very gently, while old Daniel held my head; he then made the girths fast under my body, patting and talking to me all the time; then I had a few oats, then a little leading about; and this he did every day till I began to look for the oats and the saddle.</s> <s sid="16" id="beauty.c3.s16">At length, one morning, my master got on my back and rode me round the meadow on the soft grass.</s> <s sid="17" id="beauty.c3.s17">It certainly did feel queer; but I must say I felt rather proud to carry my master, and as he continued to ride me a little every day I soon became accustomed to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="beauty.c3.p6"><s sid="18" id="beauty.c3.s18">The next unpleasant business was putting on the iron shoes; that too was very hard at first.</s> <s sid="19" id="beauty.c3.s19">My master went with me to the smith's forge, to see that I was not hurt or got any fright.</s> <s sid="20" id="beauty.c3.s20">The blacksmith took my feet in his hand, one after the other, and cut away some of the hoof.</s> <s sid="21" id="beauty.c3.s21">It did not pain me, so I stood still on three legs till he had done them all.</s> <s sid="22" id="beauty.c3.s22">Then he took a piece of iron the shape of my foot, and clapped it on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into my hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on.</s> <s sid="23" id="beauty.c3.s23">My feet felt very stiff and heavy, but in time I got used to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="beauty.c3.p7"><s sid="24" id="beauty.c3.s24">And now having got so far, my master went on to break me to harness; there were more new things to wear.</s> <s sid="25" id="beauty.c3.s25">First, a stiff heavy collar just on my neck, and a bridle with great side-pieces against my eyes called blinkers, and blinkers indeed they were, for I could not see on either side, but only straight in front of me; next, there was a small saddle with a nasty stiff strap that went right under my tail; that was the crupper.</s> <s sid="26" id="beauty.c3.s26">I hated the crupper; to have my long tail doubled up and poked through that strap was almost as bad as the bit.</s> <s sid="27" id="beauty.c3.s27">I never felt more like kicking, but of course I could not kick such a good master, and so in time I got used to everything, and could do my work as well as my mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="beauty.c3.p8"><s sid="28" id="beauty.c3.s28">I must not forget to mention one part of my training, which I have always considered a very great advantage.</s> <s sid="29" id="beauty.c3.s29">My master sent me for a fortnight to a neighboring farmer's, who had a meadow which was skirted on one side by the railway.</s> <s sid="30" id="beauty.c3.s30">Here were some sheep and cows, and I was turned in among them.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="beauty.c3.p9"><s sid="31" id="beauty.c3.s31">I shall never forget the first train that ran by.</s> <s sid="32" id="beauty.c3.s32">I was feeding quietly near the pales which separated the meadow from the railway, when I heard a strange sound at a distance, and before I knew whence it came--with a rush and a clatter, and a puffing out of smoke--a long black train of something flew by, and was gone almost before I could draw my breath.</s> <s sid="33" id="beauty.c3.s33">I turned and galloped to the further side of the meadow as fast as I could go, and there I stood snorting with astonishment and fear.</s> <s sid="34" id="beauty.c3.s34">In the course of the day many other trains went by, some more slowly; these drew up at the station close by, and sometimes made an awful shriek and groan before they stopped.</s> <s sid="35" id="beauty.c3.s35">I thought it very dreadful, but the cows went on eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads as the black frightful thing came puffing and grinding past.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="beauty.c3.p10"><s sid="36" id="beauty.c3.s36">For the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as I found that this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I began to disregard it, and very soon I cared as little about the passing of a train as the cows and sheep did.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="beauty.c3.p11"><s sid="37" id="beauty.c3.s37">Since then I have seen many horses much alarmed and restive at the sight or sound of a steam engine; but thanks to my good master's care, I am as fearless at railway stations as in my own stable.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="beauty.c3.p12"><s sid="38" id="beauty.c3.s38">Now if any one wants to break in a young horse well, that is the way.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="beauty.c3.p13" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="beauty.c3.s39">My master often drove me in double harness with my mother, because she was steady and could teach me how to go better than a strange horse.</s> <s sid="40" id="beauty.c3.s40">She told me the better I behaved the better I should be treated, and that it was wisest always to do my best to please my master; <qs/>"but,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"there are a great many kinds of men; there are good thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; and there are bad, cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own.</s> <s sid="41" id="beauty.c3.s41">Besides, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses than all, just for want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for all that.</s> <s sid="42" id="beauty.c3.s42">I hope you will fall into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us; but still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good name."<qe/></s> </p>

<title>PART I. CHAPTER 4. Birtwick Park</title>
<p pid="1" id="beauty.c4.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="beauty.c4.s1">At this time I used to stand in the stable and my coat was brushed every day till it shone like a rook's wing.</s> <s sid="2" id="beauty.c4.s2">It was early in May, when there came a man from Squire Gordon's, who took me away to the hall.</s> <s sid="3" id="beauty.c4.s3">My master said, <qs/>"Good-by, Darkie; be a good horse, and always do your best."<qe/></s> <s sid="4" id="beauty.c4.s4">I could not say "good-by", so I put my nose into his hand; he patted me kindly, and I left my first home.</s> <s sid="5" id="beauty.c4.s5">As I lived some years with Squire Gordon, I may as well tell something about the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c4.p2"><s sid="6" id="beauty.c4.s6">Squire Gordon's park skirted the village of Birtwick.</s> <s sid="7" id="beauty.c4.s7">It was entered by a large iron gate, at which stood the first lodge, and then you trotted along on a smooth road between clumps of large old trees; then another lodge and another gate, which brought you to the house and the gardens.</s> <s sid="8" id="beauty.c4.s8">Beyond this lay the home paddock, the old orchard, and the stables.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c4.s9">There was accommodation for many horses and carriages; but I need only describe the stable into which I was taken; this was very roomy, with four good stalls; a large swinging window opened into the yard, which made it pleasant and airy.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="beauty.c4.p3"><s sid="10" id="beauty.c4.s10">The first stall was a large square one, shut in behind with a wooden gate; the others were common stalls, good stalls, but not nearly so large; it had a low rack for hay and a low manger for corn; it was called a loose box, because the horse that was put into it was not tied up, but left loose, to do as he liked.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c4.s11">It is a great thing to have a loose box.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="beauty.c10.p14" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="beauty.c10.s41">This wise speech of good little Merrylegs, which we knew was quite true, cooled us all down, especially Sir Oliver, who was dearly fond of his master; and to turn the subject I said, <qs/>"Can any one tell me the use of blinkers?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="beauty.c10.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="beauty.c10.s42"><qs/>"No!"<qe/><sss/> said Sir Oliver shortly, <sse/><qs/>"because they are no use."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="beauty.c10.p19" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="beauty.c10.s48"><qs/>"I consider,"<qe/><sss/> said Sir Oliver, <sse/><qs/>"that blinkers are dangerous things in the night; we horses can see much better in the dark than men can, and many an accident would never have happened if horses might have had the full use of their eyes.</s> <s sid="49" id="beauty.c10.s49">Some years ago, I remember, there was a hearse with two horses returning one dark night, and just by Farmer Sparrow's house, where the pond is close to the road, the wheels went too near the edge, and the hearse was overturned into the water; both the horses were drowned, and the driver hardly escaped.</s> <s sid="50" id="beauty.c10.s50">Of course after this accident a stout white rail was put up that might be easily seen, but if those horses had not been partly blinded, they would of themselves have kept further from the edge, and no accident would have happened.</s> <s sid="51" id="beauty.c10.s51">When our master's carriage was overturned, before you came here, it was said that if the lamp on the left side had not gone out, John would have seen the great hole that the road-makers had left; and so he might, but if old Colin had not had blinkers on he would have seen it, lamp or no lamp, for he was far too knowing an old horse to run into danger.</s> <s sid="52" id="beauty.c10.s52">As it was, he was very much hurt, the carriage was broken, and how John escaped nobody knew."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="beauty.c10.p20" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="beauty.c10.s53"><qs/>"I should say,"<qe/><sls/> said Ginger, curling her nostril, <sle/><qs/>"that these men, who are so wise, had better give orders that in the future all foals should be born with their eyes set just in the middle of their foreheads, instead of on the side; they always think they can improve upon nature and mend what God has made."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="beauty.c10.p21" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="beauty.c10.s54">Things were getting rather sore again, when Merrylegs held up his knowing little face and said, <qs/>"I'll tell you a secret:</s> <s sid="55" id="beauty.c10.s55">I believe John does not approve of blinkers; I heard him talking with master about it one day.</s> <s sid="56" id="beauty.c10.s56">The master said that 'if horses had been used to them, it might be dangerous in some cases to leave them off'; and John said he thought it would be a good thing if all colts were broken in without blinkers, as was the case in some foreign countries.</s> <s sid="57" id="beauty.c10.s57">So let us cheer up, and have a run to the other end of the orchard; I believe the wind has blown down some apples, and we might just as well eat them as the slugs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="beauty.c10.p22"><s sid="58" id="beauty.c10.s58">Merrylegs could not be resisted, so we broke off our long conversation, and got up our spirits by munching some very sweet apples which lay scattered on the grass.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c15.p2"><s sid="7" id="beauty.c15.s7">We stopped once or twice on the road, and just as the sun was going down we reached the town where we were to spend the night.</s> <s sid="8" id="beauty.c15.s8">We stopped at the principal hotel, which was in the market-place; it was a very large one; we drove under an archway into a long yard, at the further end of which were the stables and coachhouses.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c15.s9">Two hostlers came to take us out.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c15.s10">The head hostler was a pleasant, active little man, with a crooked leg, and a yellow striped waistcoat.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c15.s11">I never saw a man unbuckle harness so quickly as he did, and with a pat and a good word he led me to a long stable, with six or eight stalls in it, and two or three horses.</s> <s sid="12" id="beauty.c15.s12">The other man brought Ginger; James stood by while we were rubbed down and cleaned.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c16.p4"><s sid="5" id="beauty.c16.s5">I cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was, but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why.</s> <s sid="6" id="beauty.c16.s6">I got up; the air seemed all thick and choking.</s> <s sid="7" id="beauty.c16.s7">I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses seemed very restless; it was quite dark, and I could see nothing, but the stable seemed full of smoke, and I hardly knew how to breathe.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="beauty.c16.p5"><s sid="8" id="beauty.c16.s8">The trapdoor had been left open, and I thought that was the place it came through.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c16.s9">I listened, and heard a soft rushing sort of noise and a low crackling and snapping.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c16.s10">I did not know what it was, but there was something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c16.s11">The other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others stamping.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="beauty.c16.p6"><s sid="12" id="beauty.c16.s12">At last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a hurry and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more.</s> <s sid="13" id="beauty.c16.s13">The first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, and they too would not stir.</s> <s sid="14" id="beauty.c16.s14">He came to me next and tried to drag me out of the stall by force; of course that was no use.</s> <s sid="15" id="beauty.c16.s15">He tried us all by turns and then left the stable.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c28.p4"><s sid="6" id="beauty.c28.s6">Then there are the loose-rein drivers, who let the reins lie easily on our backs, and their own hand rest lazily on their knees.</s> <s sid="7" id="beauty.c28.s7">Of course, such gentlemen have no control over a horse, if anything happens suddenly.</s> <s sid="8" id="beauty.c28.s8">If a horse shies, or starts, or stumbles, they are nowhere, and cannot help the horse or themselves till the mischief is done.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c28.s9">Of course, for myself I had no objection to it, as I was not in the habit either of starting or stumbling, and had only been used to depend on my driver for guidance and encouragement.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c28.s10">Still, one likes to feel the rein a little in going downhill, and likes to know that one's driver is not gone to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="beauty.c33.p10" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="beauty.c33.s35">Then there came up a broad-faced man, dressed in a great gray coat with great gray cape and great white buttons, a gray hat, and a blue comforter loosely tied round his neck; his hair was gray, too; but he was a jolly-looking fellow, and the other men made way for him.</s> <s sid="36" id="beauty.c33.s36">He looked me all over, as if he had been going to buy me; and then straightening himself up with a grunt, he said, <qs/>"He's the right sort for you, Jerry; I don't care what you gave for him, he'll be worth it."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="beauty.c33.s37">Thus my character was established on the stand.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="beauty.c33.p12"><s sid="41" id="beauty.c33.s41">The first week of my life as a cab horse was very trying.</s> <s sid="42" id="beauty.c33.s42">I had never been used to London, and the noise, the hurry, the crowds of horses, carts, and carriages that I had to make my way through made me feel anxious and harassed; but I soon found that I could perfectly trust my driver, and then I made myself easy and got used to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="beauty.c33.p13"><s sid="43" id="beauty.c33.s43">Jerry was as good a driver as I had ever known, and what was better, he took as much thought for his horses as he did for himself.</s> <s sid="44" id="beauty.c33.s44">He soon found out that I was willing to work and do my best, and he never laid the whip on me unless it was gently drawing the end of it over my back when I was to go on; but generally I knew this quite well by the way in which he took up the reins, and I believe his whip was more frequently stuck up by his side than in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="beauty.c33.p15"><s sid="48" id="beauty.c33.s48">Jerry kept us very clean, and gave us as much change of food as he could, and always plenty of it; and not only that, but he always gave us plenty of clean fresh water, which he allowed to stand by us both night and day, except of course when we came in warm.</s> <s sid="49" id="beauty.c33.s49">Some people say that a horse ought not to drink all he likes; but I know if we are allowed to drink when we want it we drink only a little at a time, and it does us a great deal more good than swallowing down half a bucketful at a time, because we have been left without till we are thirsty and miserable.</s> <s sid="50" id="beauty.c33.s50">Some grooms will go home to their beer and leave us for hours with our dry hay and oats and nothing to moisten them; then of course we gulp down too much at once, which helps to spoil our breathing and sometimes chills our stomachs.</s> <s sid="51" id="beauty.c33.s51">But the best thing we had here was our Sundays for rest; we worked so hard in the week that I do not think we could have kept up to it but for that day; besides, we had then time to enjoy each other's company.</s> <s sid="52" id="beauty.c33.s52">It was on these days that I learned my companion's history.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="beauty.c49.p1"><s sid="1" id="beauty.c49.s1">One day during this summer the groom cleaned and dressed me with such extraordinary care that I thought some new change must be at hand; he trimmed my fetlocks and legs, passed the tarbrush over my hoofs, and even parted my forelock.</s> <s sid="2" id="beauty.c49.s2">I think the harness had an extra polish.</s> <s sid="3" id="beauty.c49.s3">Willie seemed half-anxious, half-merry, as he got into the chaise with his grandfather.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="beauty.c49.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="beauty.c49.s4"><qs/>"If the ladies take to him,"<qe/><sss/> said the old gentleman, <sse/><qs/>"they'll be suited and he'll be suited.</s> <s sid="5" id="beauty.c49.s5">We can but try."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="beauty.c49.p3"><s sid="6" id="beauty.c49.s6">At the distance of a mile or two from the village we came to a pretty, low house, with a lawn and shrubbery at the front and a drive up to the door.</s> <s sid="7" id="beauty.c49.s7">Willie rang the bell, and asked if Miss Blomefield or Miss Ellen was at home.</s> <s sid="8" id="beauty.c49.s8">Yes, they were.</s> <s sid="9" id="beauty.c49.s9">So, while Willie stayed with me, Mr. Thoroughgood went into the house.</s> <s sid="10" id="beauty.c49.s10">In about ten minutes he returned, followed by three ladies; one tall, pale lady, wrapped in a white shawl, leaned on a younger lady, with dark eyes and a merry face; the other, a very stately-looking person, was Miss Blomefield.</s> <s sid="11" id="beauty.c49.s11">They all came and looked at me and asked questions.</s> <s sid="12" id="beauty.c49.s12">The younger lady--that was Miss Ellen--took to me very much; she said she was sure she should like me, I had such a good face.</s> <s sid="13" id="beauty.c49.s13">The tall, pale lady said that she should always be nervous in riding behind a horse that had once been down, as I might come down again, and if I did she should never get over the fright.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="beauty.c49.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="beauty.c49.s14"><qs/>"You see, ladies,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Thoroughgood, <sse/><qs/>"many first-rate horses have had their knees broken through the carelessness of their drivers without any fault of their own, and from what I see of this horse I should say that is his case; but of course I do not wish to influence you.</s> <s sid="15" id="beauty.c49.s15">If you incline you can have him on trial, and then your coachman will see what he thinks of him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="beauty.c49.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="beauty.c49.s16"><qs/>"You have always been such a good adviser to us about our horses,"<qe/><sss/> said the stately lady, <sse/><qs/>"that your recommendation would go a long way with me, and if my sister Lavinia sees no objection we will accept your offer of a trial, with thanks."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="beauty.c49.p6"><s sid="17" id="beauty.c49.s17">It was then arranged that I should be sent for the next day.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="beauty.c49.p7"><s sid="18" id="beauty.c49.s18">In the morning a smart-looking young man came for me.</s> <s sid="19" id="beauty.c49.s19">At first he looked pleased; but when he saw my knees he said in a disappointed voice:</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="beauty.c49.p8" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="beauty.c49.s20"><qs/>"I didn't think, sir, you would have recommended my ladies a blemished horse like that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="beauty.c49.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="beauty.c49.s21"><qs/>"'Handsome is that handsome does',"<qe/><sss/> said my master; <sse/><qs/>"you are only taking him on trial, and I am sure you will do fairly by him, young man.</s> <s sid="22" id="beauty.c49.s22">If he is not as safe as any horse you ever drove send him back."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="beauty.c49.p10"><s sid="23" id="beauty.c49.s23">I was led to my new home, placed in a comfortable stable, fed, and left to myself.</s> <s sid="24" id="beauty.c49.s24">The next day, when the groom was cleaning my face, he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="beauty.c49.p11" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="beauty.c49.s25"><qs/>"That is just like the star that 'Black Beauty' had; he is much the same height, too.</s> <s sid="26" id="beauty.c49.s26">I wonder where he is now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="beauty.c49.p12"><s sid="27" id="beauty.c49.s27">A little further on he came to the place in my neck where I was bled and where a little knot was left in the skin.</s> <s sid="28" id="beauty.c49.s28">He almost started, and began to look me over carefully, talking to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="beauty.c49.p13" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="beauty.c49.s29"><qs/>"White star in the forehead, one white foot on the off side, this little knot just in that place;"<qe/><sls/> then looking at the middle of my back--<sle/><qs/>"and, as I am alive, there is that little patch of white hair that John used to call 'Beauty's three-penny bit'.</s> <s sid="30" id="beauty.c49.s30">It must be 'Black Beauty'!</s> <s sid="31" id="beauty.c49.s31">Why, Beauty!</s> <s sid="32" id="beauty.c49.s32">Beauty! do you know me?--little Joe Green, that almost killed you?"<qe/></s> <s sid="33" id="beauty.c49.s33">And he began patting and patting me as if he was quite overjoyed.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="beauty.c49.p14"><s sid="34" id="beauty.c49.s34">I could not say that I remembered him, for now he was a fine grown young fellow, with black whiskers and a man's voice, but I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad.</s> <s sid="35" id="beauty.c49.s35">I put my nose up to him, and tried to say that we were friends.</s> <s sid="36" id="beauty.c49.s36">I never saw a man so pleased.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="beauty.c49.p15" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="beauty.c49.s37"><qs/>"Give you a fair trial!</s> <s sid="38" id="beauty.c49.s38">I should think so indeed!</s> <s sid="39" id="beauty.c49.s39">I wonder who the rascal was that broke your knees, my old Beauty! you must have been badly served out somewhere; well, well, it won't be my fault if you haven't good times of it now.</s> <s sid="40" id="beauty.c49.s40">I wish John Manly was here to see you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="beauty.c49.p16"><s sid="41" id="beauty.c49.s41">In the afternoon I was put into a low park chair and brought to the door.</s> <s sid="42" id="beauty.c49.s42">Miss Ellen was going to try me, and Green went with her.</s> <s sid="43" id="beauty.c49.s43">I soon found that she was a good driver, and she seemed pleased with my paces.</s> <s sid="44" id="beauty.c49.s44">I heard Joe telling her about me, and that he was sure I was Squire Gordon's old "Black Beauty".</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="beauty.c49.p17"><s sid="45" id="beauty.c49.s45">When we returned the other sisters came out to hear how I had behaved myself.</s> <s sid="46" id="beauty.c49.s46">She told them what she had just heard, and said:</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="beauty.c49.p18" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="beauty.c49.s47"><qs/>"I shall certainly write to Mrs. Gordon, and tell her that her favorite horse has come to us.</s> <s sid="48" id="beauty.c49.s48">How pleased she will be!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="beauty.c49.p19"><s sid="49" id="beauty.c49.s49">After this I was driven every day for a week or so, and as I appeared to be quite safe, Miss Lavinia at last ventured out in the small close carriage.</s> <s sid="50" id="beauty.c49.s50">After this it was quite decided to keep me and call me by my old name of "Black Beauty".</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="beauty.c49.p20"><s sid="51" id="beauty.c49.s51">I have now lived in this happy place a whole year.</s> <s sid="52" id="beauty.c49.s52">Joe is the best and kindest of grooms.</s> <s sid="53" id="beauty.c49.s53">My work is easy and pleasant, and I feel my strength and spirits all coming back again.</s> <s sid="54" id="beauty.c49.s54">Mr. Thoroughgood said to Joe the other day:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="beauty.c49.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="beauty.c49.s55"><qs/>"In your place he will last till he is twenty years old--perhaps more."<qe/></s> </p>
