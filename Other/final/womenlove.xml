<p pid="2" id="womenlove.c2.p2"><s sid="5" id="womenlove.c2.s5">It was crowded now with the family and the wedding guests.</s> <s sid="6" id="womenlove.c2.s6">The father, who was not well, withdrew to rest.</s> <s sid="7" id="womenlove.c2.s7">Gerald was host.</s> <s sid="8" id="womenlove.c2.s8">He stood in the homely entrance hall, friendly and easy, attending to the men.</s> <s sid="9" id="womenlove.c2.s9">He seemed to take pleasure in his social functions, he smiled, and was abundant in hospitality.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="womenlove.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="womenlove.c2.s10">The women wandered about in a little confusion, chased hither and thither by the three married daughters of the house.</s> <s sid="11" id="womenlove.c2.s11">All the while there could be heard the characteristic, imperious voice of one Crich woman or another calling <qs/>'Helen, come here a minute,'<qe/> 'Marjory, I want you--here.'</s> <s sid="12" id="womenlove.c2.s12"><qs/>'Oh, I say, Mrs Witham--.'<qe/></s> <s sid="13" id="womenlove.c2.s13">There was a great rustling of skirts, swift glimpses of smartly-dressed women, a child danced through the hall and back again, a maidservant came and went hurriedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="womenlove.c2.p4"><s sid="14" id="womenlove.c2.s14">Meanwhile the men stood in calm little groups, chatting, smoking, pretending to pay no heed to the rustling animation of the women's world.</s> <s sid="15" id="womenlove.c2.s15">But they could not really talk, because of the glassy ravel of women's excited, cold laughter and running voices.</s> <s sid="16" id="womenlove.c2.s16">They waited, uneasy, suspended, rather bored.</s> <s sid="17" id="womenlove.c2.s17">But Gerald remained as if genial and happy, unaware that he was waiting or unoccupied, knowing himself the very pivot of the occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="womenlove.c2.p5"><s sid="18" id="womenlove.c2.s18">Suddenly Mrs Crich came noiselessly into the room, peering about with her strong, clear face.</s> <s sid="19" id="womenlove.c2.s19">She was still wearing her hat, and her sac coat of blue silk.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="womenlove.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="womenlove.c2.s20"><qs/>'What is it, mother?'<qe/> said Gerald.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="womenlove.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="womenlove.c2.s21"><qs/>'Nothing, nothing!'<qe/> she answered vaguely.</s> <s sid="22" id="womenlove.c2.s22">And she went straight towards Birkin, who was talking to a Crich brother-in-law.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="womenlove.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="womenlove.c2.s23"><qs/>'How do you do, Mr Birkin,'<qe/> she said, in her low voice, that seemed to take no count of her guests.</s> <s sid="24" id="womenlove.c2.s24">She held out her hand to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="womenlove.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="womenlove.c2.s25"><qs/>'Oh Mrs Crich,'<qe/><sls/> replied Birkin, in his readily-changing voice, <sle/><qs/>'I couldn't come to you before.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="womenlove.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="womenlove.c2.s26"><qs/>'I don't know half the people here,'<qe/> she said, in her low voice.</s> <s sid="27" id="womenlove.c2.s27">Her son-in-law moved uneasily away.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="womenlove.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="womenlove.c2.s28"><qs/>'And you don't like strangers?'<qe/> laughed Birkin.</s> <s sid="29" id="womenlove.c2.s29"><qs/>'I myself can never see why one should take account of people, just because they happen to be in the room with one: why SHOULD I know they are there?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="womenlove.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="womenlove.c2.s30"><qs/>'Why indeed, why indeed!'<qe/> said Mrs Crich, in her low, tense voice.</s> <s sid="31" id="womenlove.c2.s31"><qs/>'Except that they ARE there.</s> <s sid="32" id="womenlove.c2.s32">I don't know people whom I find in the house.</s> <s sid="33" id="womenlove.c2.s33">The children introduce them to me--<alt-qs/>"Mother, this is Mr So-and-so."<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="womenlove.c2.s34">I am no further.</s> <s sid="35" id="womenlove.c2.s35">What has Mr So-and-so to do with his own name?--and what have I to do with either him or his name?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="womenlove.c2.p13"><s sid="36" id="womenlove.c2.s36">She looked up at Birkin.</s> <s sid="37" id="womenlove.c2.s37">She startled him.</s> <s sid="38" id="womenlove.c2.s38">He was flattered too that she came to talk to him, for she took hardly any notice of anybody.</s> <s sid="39" id="womenlove.c2.s39">He looked down at her tense clear face, with its heavy features, but he was afraid to look into her heavy-seeing blue eyes.</s> <s sid="40" id="womenlove.c2.s40">He noticed instead how her hair looped in slack, slovenly strands over her rather beautiful ears, which were not quite clean.</s> <s sid="41" id="womenlove.c2.s41">Neither was her neck perfectly clean.</s> <s sid="42" id="womenlove.c2.s42">Even in that he seemed to belong to her, rather than to the rest of the company; though, he thought to himself, he was always well washed, at any rate at the neck and ears.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="womenlove.c2.p14"><s sid="43" id="womenlove.c2.s43">He smiled faintly, thinking these things.</s> <s sid="44" id="womenlove.c2.s44">Yet he was tense, feeling that he and the elderly, estranged woman were conferring together like traitors, like enemies within the camp of the other people.</s> <s sid="45" id="womenlove.c2.s45">He resembled a deer, that throws one ear back upon the trail behind, and one ear forward, to know what is ahead.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="womenlove.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="womenlove.c2.s46"><qs/>'People don't really matter,'<qe/> he said, rather unwilling to continue.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="womenlove.c2.p16"><s sid="47" id="womenlove.c2.s47">The mother looked up at him with sudden, dark interrogation, as if doubting his sincerity.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="womenlove.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="womenlove.c2.s48"><qs/>'How do you mean, MATTER?'<qe/> she asked sharply.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="womenlove.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="womenlove.c2.s49"><qs/>'Not many people are anything at all,'<qe/> he answered, forced to go deeper than he wanted to.</s> <s sid="50" id="womenlove.c2.s50"><qs/>'They jingle and giggle.</s> <s sid="51" id="womenlove.c2.s51">It would be much better if they were just wiped out.</s> <s sid="52" id="womenlove.c2.s52">Essentially, they don't exist, they aren't there.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="womenlove.c2.p19"><s sid="53" id="womenlove.c2.s53">She watched him steadily while he spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="womenlove.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="womenlove.c2.s54"><qs/>'But we didn't imagine them,'<qe/> she said sharply.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="womenlove.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="womenlove.c2.s55"><qs/>'There's nothing to imagine, that's why they don't exist.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="womenlove.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="womenlove.c2.s56"><qs/>'Well,'<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>'I would hardly go as far as that.</s> <s sid="57" id="womenlove.c2.s57">There they are, whether they exist or no.</s> <s sid="58" id="womenlove.c2.s58">It doesn't rest with me to decide on their existence.</s> <s sid="59" id="womenlove.c2.s59">I only know that I can't be expected to take count of them all.</s> <s sid="60" id="womenlove.c2.s60">You can't expect me to know them, just because they happen to be there.</s> <s sid="61" id="womenlove.c2.s61">As far as I go they might as well not be there.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="womenlove.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="womenlove.c2.s62"><qs/>'Exactly,'<qe/> he replied.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="womenlove.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="womenlove.c2.s63"><qs/>'Mightn't they?'<qe/> she asked again.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="womenlove.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="womenlove.c2.s64"><qs/>'Just as well,'<qe/> he repeated.</s> <s sid="65" id="womenlove.c2.s65">And there was a little pause.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="womenlove.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="womenlove.c2.s66"><qs/>'Except that they ARE there, and that's a nuisance,'<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="67" id="womenlove.c2.s67"><qs/>'There are my sons-in-law,'<qe/> she went on, in a sort of monologue.</s> <s sid="68" id="womenlove.c2.s68"><qs/>'Now Laura's got married, there's another.</s> <s sid="69" id="womenlove.c2.s69">And I really don't know John from James yet.</s> <s sid="70" id="womenlove.c2.s70">They come up to me and call me mother.</s> <s sid="71" id="womenlove.c2.s71">I know what they will say--<alt-qs/>"how are you, mother?"<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="womenlove.c2.s72">I ought to say, <alt-qs/>"I am not your mother, in any sense."<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="73" id="womenlove.c2.s73">But what is the use?</s> <s sid="74" id="womenlove.c2.s74">There they are.</s> <s sid="75" id="womenlove.c2.s75">I have had children of my own.</s> <s sid="76" id="womenlove.c2.s76">I suppose I know them from another woman's children.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="womenlove.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="womenlove.c2.s77"><qs/>'One would suppose so,'<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="womenlove.c2.p28"><s sid="78" id="womenlove.c2.s78">She looked at him, somewhat surprised, forgetting perhaps that she was talking to him.</s> <s sid="79" id="womenlove.c2.s79">And she lost her thread.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="womenlove.c2.p29"><s sid="80" id="womenlove.c2.s80">She looked round the room, vaguely.</s> <s sid="81" id="womenlove.c2.s81">Birkin could not guess what she was looking for, nor what she was thinking.</s> <s sid="82" id="womenlove.c2.s82">Evidently she noticed her sons.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="womenlove.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="womenlove.c2.s83"><qs/>'Are my children all there?'<qe/> she asked him abruptly.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="womenlove.c2.p31"><s sid="84" id="womenlove.c2.s84">He laughed, startled, afraid perhaps.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="womenlove.c2.p32" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="womenlove.c2.s85"><qs/>'I scarcely know them, except Gerald,'<qe/> he replied.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="womenlove.c2.p33" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="womenlove.c2.s86"><qs/>'Gerald!'<qe/> she exclaimed.</s> <s sid="87" id="womenlove.c2.s87"><qs/>'He's the most wanting of them all.</s> <s sid="88" id="womenlove.c2.s88">You'd never think it, to look at him now, would you?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="womenlove.c2.p34" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="womenlove.c2.s89"><qs/>'No,'<qe/> said Birkin.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="womenlove.c2.p35"><s sid="90" id="womenlove.c2.s90">The mother looked across at her eldest son, stared at him heavily for some time.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="womenlove.c2.p36" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="womenlove.c2.s91"><qs/>'Ay,'<qe/> she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, that sounded profoundly cynical.</s> <s sid="92" id="womenlove.c2.s92">Birkin felt afraid, as if he dared not realise.</s> <s sid="93" id="womenlove.c2.s93">And Mrs Crich moved away, forgetting him.</s> <s sid="94" id="womenlove.c2.s94">But she returned on her traces.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="womenlove.c2.p39"><s sid="100" id="womenlove.c2.s100">Then he remembered, with a slight shock, that that was Cain's cry.</s> <s sid="101" id="womenlove.c2.s101">And Gerald was Cain, if anybody.</s> <s sid="102" id="womenlove.c2.s102">Not that he was Cain, either, although he had slain his brother.</s> <s sid="103" id="womenlove.c2.s103">There was such a thing as pure accident, and the consequences did not attach to one, even though one had killed one's brother in such wise.</s> <s sid="104" id="womenlove.c2.s104">Gerald as a boy had accidentally killed his brother.</s> <s sid="105" id="womenlove.c2.s105">What then?</s> <s sid="106" id="womenlove.c2.s106">Why seek to draw a brand and a curse across the life that had caused the accident?</s> <s sid="107" id="womenlove.c2.s107">A man can live by accident, and die by accident.</s> <s sid="108" id="womenlove.c2.s108">Or can he not?</s> <s sid="109" id="womenlove.c2.s109">Is every man's life subject to pure accident, is it only the race, the genus, the species, that has a universal reference?</s> <s sid="110" id="womenlove.c2.s110">Or is this not true, is there no such thing as pure accident?</s> <s sid="111" id="womenlove.c2.s111">Has EVERYTHING that happens a universal significance?</s> <s sid="112" id="womenlove.c2.s112">Has it?</s> <s sid="113" id="womenlove.c2.s113">Birkin, pondering as he stood there, had forgotten Mrs Crich, as she had forgotten him.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="womenlove.c2.p41"><s sid="116" id="womenlove.c2.s116">Just as he had decided this, one of the Crich daughters came up, saying:</s> </p>
