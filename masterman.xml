<title>CHAPTER 1.</title>
<p pid="1" id="masterman.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="masterman.c1.s1">It was in the month of October, 18---, that the _Pacific_, a large ship, was running before a heavy gale of wind in the middle of the vast Atlantic Ocean.</s> <s sid="2" id="masterman.c1.s2">She had but little sail, for the wind was so strong, that the canvas would have been split into pieces by the furious blasts before which she was driven through the waves, which were very high, and following her almost as fast as she darted through their boiling waters; sometimes heaving up her stern and sinking her bows down so deep into the hollow of the sea, that it appeared as if she would have dived down underneath the waves; but she was a fine vessel, and the captain was a good seaman, who did what he considered best for the safety of his vessel, and then put his trust in that Providence who is ever watchful over us.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="masterman.c1.s3">The captain stood before the wheel, watching the men who were steering the ship; for when you are running before a heavy gale, it requires great attention to the helm: and as he looked around him and up at the heavens, he sang in a low voice the words of a sea song:</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="masterman.c1.s4"><qs/>"One wide water all around us, All above us one black sky."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="masterman.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="masterman.c1.s5">And so it was with them;--they were in the middle of the Atlantic, not another vessel to be seen, and the heavens were covered with black clouds, which were borne along furiously by the gale; the sea ran mountains high, and broke into large white foaming crests, while the fierce wind howled through the rigging of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="masterman.c1.p5"><s sid="6" id="masterman.c1.s6">Besides the captain of the ship and the two men at the wheel, there were two other personages on deck: one was a young lad about twelve years old, and the other a weather-beaten old seaman, whose grisly locks were streaming in the wind, as he paced aft and looked over the taffrail of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="masterman.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="masterman.c1.s7">The young lad, observing a heavy sea coming up to the stern of the vessel, caught hold of the old man's arm, crying out--<qs/>"Won't that great wave come into us, Ready?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="masterman.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="masterman.c1.s8"><qs/>"No, Master William, it will not: don't you see how the ship lifts her quarters to it?--and now it has passed underneath us.</s> <s sid="9" id="masterman.c1.s9">But it might happen, and then what would become of you, if I did not hold on, and hold you on also?</s> <s sid="10" id="masterman.c1.s10">You would be washed overboard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="masterman.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="masterman.c1.s11"><qs/>"I don't like the sea much, Ready; I wish we were safe on shore again,"<qe/> replied the lad.</s> <s sid="12" id="masterman.c1.s12"><qs/>"Don't the waves look as if they wished to beat the ship all to pieces?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="masterman.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="masterman.c1.s13"><qs/>"Yes, they do; and they roar as if angry because they cannot bury the vessel beneath them: but I am used to them, and with a good ship like this, and a good captain and crew, I don't care for them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="masterman.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="masterman.c1.s14"><qs/>"But sometimes ships do sink, and then everybody is drowned."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="masterman.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="masterman.c1.s15"><qs/>"Yes; and very often the very ships sink which those on board think are most safe.</s> <s sid="16" id="masterman.c1.s16">We can only do our best, and after that we must submit to the will of Heaven."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="masterman.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="masterman.c1.s17"><qs/>"What little birds are those flying about so close to the water?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="masterman.c1.p14"><s sid="20" id="masterman.c1.s20">The birds which William referred to were the stormy petrels.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="masterman.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="masterman.c1.s21"><qs/>"Were you ever shipwrecked on a desolate island like Robinson Crusoe?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="masterman.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="masterman.c1.s22"><qs/>"Yes, Master William, I have been shipwrecked; but I never heard of Robinson Crusoe.</s> <s sid="23" id="masterman.c1.s23">So many have been wrecked and undergone great hardships, and so many more have never lived to tell what they have suffered, that it's not very likely that I should have known that one man you speak of, out of so many."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="masterman.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="masterman.c1.s24"><qs/>"Oh! but it's all in a book which I have read.</s> <s sid="25" id="masterman.c1.s25">I could tell you all about it--and so I will when the ship is quiet again; but now I wish you would help me down below, for I promised mamma not to stay up long."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="masterman.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="masterman.c1.s26"><qs/>"Then always keep your promise like a good lad,"<qe/><sss/> replied the old man; <sse/><qs/>"now give me your hand, and I'll answer for it that we will fetch the hatchway without a tumble; and when the weather is fine again, I'll tell you how I was wrecked, and you shall tell me all about Robinson Crusoe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="masterman.c1.p19"><s sid="27" id="masterman.c1.s27">Having seen William safe to the cabin door, the old seaman returned to the deck, for it was his watch.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="masterman.c1.p20"><s sid="28" id="masterman.c1.s28">Masterman Ready, for such was his name, had been more than fifty years at sea, having been bound apprentice to a collier which sailed from South Shields, when he was only ten years old.</s> <s sid="29" id="masterman.c1.s29">His face was browned from long exposure, and there were deep furrows on his cheeks, but he was still a hale and active man.</s> <s sid="30" id="masterman.c1.s30">He had served many years on board of a man-of-war, and had been in every climate: he had many strange stories to tell, and he might be believed even when his stories were strange, for he would not tell an untruth.</s> <s sid="31" id="masterman.c1.s31">He could navigate a vessel, and, of course, he could read and write.</s> <s sid="32" id="masterman.c1.s32">The name of Ready was very well suited to him, for he was seldom at a loss; and in cases of difficulty and danger, the captain would not hesitate to ask his opinion, and frequently take his advice.</s> <s sid="33" id="masterman.c1.s33">He was second mate of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="masterman.c1.p21"><s sid="34" id="masterman.c1.s34">The _Pacific_ was, as we have observed, a very fine ship, and well able to contend with the most violent storm.</s> <s sid="35" id="masterman.c1.s35">She was of more than four hundred tons burthen, and was then making a passage out to New South Wales, with a valuable cargo of English hardware, cutlery, and other manufactures.</s> <s sid="36" id="masterman.c1.s36">The captain was a good navigator and seaman, and moreover a good man, of a cheerful, happy disposition, always making the best of everything, and when accidents did happen, always more inclined to laugh than to look grave.</s> <s sid="37" id="masterman.c1.s37">His name was Osborn.</s> <s sid="38" id="masterman.c1.s38">The first mate, whose name was Mackintosh, was a Scotsman, rough and ill-tempered, but paying strict attention to his duty--a man that Captain Osborn could trust, but whom he did not like.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="masterman.c1.p22"><s sid="39" id="masterman.c1.s39">Ready we have already spoken of, and it will not be necessary to say anything about the seamen on board, except that there were thirteen of them, hardly a sufficient number to man so large a vessel; but just as they were about to sail, five of the seamen, who did not like the treatment they had received from Mackintosh, the first mate, had left the ship, and Captain Osborn did not choose to wait until he could obtain others in their stead.</s> <s sid="40" id="masterman.c1.s40">This proved unfortunate, as the events which we shall hereafter relate will show.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 2.</title>
<p pid="1" id="masterman.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="masterman.c2.s1">Master William, whom we have introduced to the reader, was the eldest boy of a family who were passengers on board, consisting of the father, mother, and four children: his father was a Mr Seagrave, a very well-informed, clever man, who having for many years held an office under government at Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, was now returning from a leave of absence of three years.</s> <s sid="2" id="masterman.c2.s2">He had purchased from the government several thousand acres of land; it had since risen very much in value, and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were proving a source of great profit.</s> <s sid="3" id="masterman.c2.s3">His property had been well managed by the person who had charge of it during his absence in England, and he was now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description for its improvement, and for his own use, such as furniture for his house, implements of agriculture, seeds, plants, cattle, and many other things too numerous to mention.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="masterman.c2.s4">Mrs Seagrave was an amiable woman, but not in very strong health.</s> <s sid="5" id="masterman.c2.s5">The family consisted of William, who was the eldest, a clever, steady boy, but, at the same time, full of mirth and humour; Thomas, who was six years old, a very thoughtless but good-tempered boy, full of mischief, and always in a scrape; Caroline, a little girl of seven years; and Albert, a fine strong little fellow, who was not one year old: he was under the charge of a black girl, who had come from the Cape of Good Hope to Sydney, and had followed Mrs Seagrave to England.</s> <s sid="6" id="masterman.c2.s6">We have now mentioned all the people on board of the Pacific: perhaps we ought not to forget two shepherd's dogs, belonging to Mr Seagrave, and a little terrier, which was a great favourite of Captain Osborn, to whom she belonged.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c2.p3"><s sid="7" id="masterman.c2.s7">It was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale abated, and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm.</s> <s sid="8" id="masterman.c2.s8">The men who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought all their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray, and hung them up in the rigging to dry: the sails, also, which had been furled, and had been saturated by the wet, were now loosened and spread out that they might not be mildewed.</s> <s sid="9" id="masterman.c2.s9">The wind blew mild and soft, the sea had gone down, and the ship was running through the water at the speed of about four miles an hour.</s> <s sid="10" id="masterman.c2.s10">Mrs Seagrave, wrapped up in a cloak, was seated upon one of the arm-chests near the stern of the ship, her husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather, when Captain Osborn, who had been taking an observation of the sun with his sextant, came up to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="masterman.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="masterman.c2.s14"><qs/>"It was a mercy that poor Albert was not killed,"<qe/> observed Mrs Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="masterman.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="masterman.c2.s15"><qs/>"And so he might have been, if Juno had not thought only of him and nothing at all about herself,"<qe/> replied Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="masterman.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="masterman.c2.s16"><qs/>"That's very true, sir,"<qe/> replied Captain Osborn.</s> <s sid="17" id="masterman.c2.s17"><qs/>"She saved the child, and, I fear, hurt herself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="masterman.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="masterman.c2.s18"><qs/>"I thump my head very hard,"<qe/> said Juno, smiling.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="masterman.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="masterman.c2.s23"><qs/>"Here are the dogs come up on deck,"<qe/><sss/> said William; <sse/><qs/>"I dare say they are as glad of the fine weather as we are.</s> <s sid="24" id="masterman.c2.s24">Come here, Romulus!</s> <s sid="25" id="masterman.c2.s25">Here, Remus!--Remus!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="masterman.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="masterman.c2.s26"><qs/>"Well, sir,"<qe/><sls/> said Ready, who was standing by them with his quadrant in his hand, <sle/><qs/>"I should like to ask you a question.</s> <s sid="27" id="masterman.c2.s27">Those dogs of yours have two very odd names which I never heard before.</s> <s sid="28" id="masterman.c2.s28">Who were Romulus and Remus?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="masterman.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="masterman.c2.s29"><qs/>"Romulus and Remus,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mr Seagrave, <sse/><qs/>"were the names of two shepherds, brothers, who in ancient days founded the city of Rome, which eventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world.</s> <s sid="30" id="masterman.c2.s30">They were the first kings of Rome, and reigned together.</s> <s sid="31" id="masterman.c2.s31">History says that Remus affronted Romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised, and Romulus, in his anger, took away his life; but the history of early days is not to be depended upon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="masterman.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="masterman.c2.s32"><qs/>"No, nor the brothers either, it appears,"<qe/><sss/> replied Ready; <sse/><qs/>"however, it is the old story--two of a trade can never agree.</s> <s sid="33" id="masterman.c2.s33">One sometimes hears of Rome now--is that the same place?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="masterman.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="masterman.c2.s34"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> replied William, <sse/><qs/>"it is the remains of the old city."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="masterman.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="masterman.c2.s35"><qs/>"Well, one lives and learns,"<qe/> said Ready.</s> <s sid="36" id="masterman.c2.s36"><qs/>"I have learnt something to-day, which everyone will to the last day of his life, if he will only ask questions.</s> <s sid="37" id="masterman.c2.s37">I'm an old man, and perhaps don't know much, except in the seafaring way; but I should have known much less if I did not ask for information, and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance; that's the way to learn, Master William."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="masterman.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="masterman.c2.s38"><qs/>"Very good advice, Ready,--and, William, I hope you will profit by it,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr Seagrave; <sse/><qs/>"never be ashamed to ask the meaning of what you do not understand."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="masterman.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="masterman.c2.s43"><qs/>"That I will, ma'am,"<qe/> said Ready, putting his quadrant on the capstan:</s> <s sid="44" id="masterman.c2.s44"><qs/>"now, Juno, give me the child, and go down first;--backwards, you stupid girl! how often do I tell you that?</s> <s sid="45" id="masterman.c2.s45">Some day or another you will come down with a run."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c19.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="masterman.c19.s4"><qs/>"I think,"<qe/><sss/> said Ready, <sse/><qs/>"we have done a good day's work; tomorrow we shall be able to do much more, for the sea is going down, and the sun is showing himself from the corner of that cloud.</s> <s sid="5" id="masterman.c19.s5">Now we will go to supper, and then see if we can make ourselves more comfortable for the night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c19.p3"><s sid="6" id="masterman.c19.s6">The tent which had not been blown down was given to Mrs Seagrave and the children, and the other was fitted up as well as it could be.</s> <s sid="7" id="masterman.c19.s7">The bedding being all wet, they procured some sails from the stores, which, being stowed away farther in the grove, had not suffered much from the tempest; and, spreading the canvas, they lay down, and the night passed without any disaster, for the wind was now lulled to a pleasant breeze.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="masterman.c19.p4"><s sid="8" id="masterman.c19.s8">The next morning the sun shone bright--the air was fresh and bracing; but a slight breeze rippled the waters, and there was little or no surf.</s> <s sid="9" id="masterman.c19.s9">The various fragments of the wreck were tossed by the little surf that still remained; many things were lying on the beach which had landed during the night, and many more required but a little trouble to secure them.</s> <s sid="10" id="masterman.c19.s10">There appeared to be a sort of in draught into the cove, as all the articles which had been floating out at sea were now gradually coming on shore in that direction.</s> <s sid="11" id="masterman.c19.s11">Ready and Mr Seagrave worked till breakfast-time, and had by that time saved a great many casks and packages.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="masterman.c19.p5" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="masterman.c19.s12">After breakfast they went down again to the beach and resumed their labours.</s> <s sid="13" id="masterman.c19.s13"><qs/>"Look, Ready; what is that?"<qe/> said William, who was with them, as he pointed to a white-looking mass floating in the cove.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="masterman.c19.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="masterman.c19.s14"><qs/>"That, sir, is the poor cow; and if you look again, you will see the sharks are around, making a feast of her: don't you see them?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="masterman.c19.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="masterman.c19.s15"><qs/>"Yes, I do--what a quantity!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="masterman.c19.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="masterman.c19.s16"><qs/>"Yes, there's no want of them, William; so be very careful how you get into the water, and never let Tommy go near it, for they don't care how shallow it is when they see their food.</s> <s sid="17" id="masterman.c19.s17">But now, sir,"<qe/><sss/> said Ready, <sse/><qs/>"I must leave you and William to do what you can in saving any more of the wreck, while I set to and put the boat in proper repair."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="masterman.c19.p9"><s sid="18" id="masterman.c19.s18">Ready left them at their own employment, and went away for his tools.</s> <s sid="19" id="masterman.c19.s19">During this time Mr Seagrave and William occupied themselves in collecting the different articles thrown on shore, and rolling up the casks as far as they could.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="masterman.c19.p10"><s sid="20" id="masterman.c19.s20">As it would take some days for Ready to put the boat into proper order, Mr Seagrave determined that he would go to the other side of the island with William, that he might examine it himself; and, as Mrs Seagrave had no objection to be left with Ready and Juno, on the third day after the gale they set off.</s> <s sid="21" id="masterman.c19.s21">William led the way, guiding his footsteps through the grove by the blazing of the cocoa-nut trees; and in two hours they reached their destination.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="masterman.c19.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="masterman.c19.s22"><qs/>"Is not this beautiful, father?"<qe/> said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="masterman.c19.p12" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="masterman.c19.s23"><qs/>"Yes, indeed it is, my dear boy,"<qe/> replied Mr Seagrave.</s> <s sid="24" id="masterman.c19.s24"><qs/>"I fancied that nothing could be more beautiful than the spot where we reside, but this surpasses it, not only in variety, but in extent."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="masterman.c19.p13" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="masterman.c19.s25"><qs/>"And now let us examine the spring, father,"<qe/> said William, leading the way to the ravine.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="masterman.c19.p14"><s sid="26" id="masterman.c19.s26">The spring was full and flowing, and the water excellent.</s> <s sid="27" id="masterman.c19.s27">They then directed their steps towards the sandy beach, and, having walked some time, sat down upon a coral rock.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="masterman.c19.p15" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="masterman.c19.s28"><qs/>"Who would have ever imagined, William,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr Seagrave, <sse/><qs/>"that this island, and so many more which abound in the Pacific Ocean, could have been raised by the work of little insects not bigger than a pin's head?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="masterman.c19.p16" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="masterman.c19.s29"><qs/>"Insects, father?"<qe/> replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="masterman.c19.p17" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="masterman.c19.s30"><qs/>"Yes, insects.</s> <s sid="31" id="masterman.c19.s31">Give me that piece of dead coral, William.</s> <s sid="32" id="masterman.c19.s32">Do you see that on every branch there are a hundred little holes?</s> <s sid="33" id="masterman.c19.s33">Well, in every one of these little holes once lived a sea-insect; and as these insects increase, so do the branches of the coral-trees."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="masterman.c19.p18" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="masterman.c19.s34"><qs/>"Yes, I understand that; but how do you make out that this island was made by them?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="masterman.c19.p19" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="masterman.c19.s35"><qs/>"Almost all the islands in these seas have been made by the labour and increase of these small animals.</s> <s sid="36" id="masterman.c19.s36">The coral grows at first at the bottom of the sea, where it is not disturbed by the winds or waves: by degrees, as it increases, it advances higher and higher to the surface, till at last it comes near to the top of the water; then it is stopped in its growth by the force of the winds and waves, which break it off, and of course it never grows above the water, for if it did the animals would die."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="masterman.c19.p20" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="masterman.c19.s37"><qs/>"Then how does it become an island?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="masterman.c19.p21" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="masterman.c19.s38"><qs/>"By very slow degrees; the time, perhaps, much depending upon chance: for instance, a log of wood floating about, and covered with barnacles, may ground upon the coral reefs; that would be a sufficient commencement, for it would remain above water, and then shelter the coral to leeward of it, until a flat rock had formed, level with the edge of the water.</s> <s sid="39" id="masterman.c19.s39">The sea-birds are always looking for a place to rest upon, and they would soon find it, and then their droppings would, in course of time, form a little patch above water, and other floating substances would be thrown on it; and land-birds, who are blown out to sea, might rest themselves on it, and the seeds from their stomachs, when dropped, would grow into trees or bushes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="masterman.c19.p22" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="masterman.c19.s40"><qs/>"I understand that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="masterman.c19.p23" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="masterman.c19.s41"><qs/>"Well then, William, you observe there is an island commenced, as it were, and, once commenced, it soon increases, for the coral would then be protected to leeward, and grow up fast.</s> <s sid="42" id="masterman.c19.s42">Do you observe how the coral reefs extend at this side of the island, where they are protected from the winds and waves; and how different it is on the weather side, which we have just left?</s> <s sid="43" id="masterman.c19.s43">Just so the little patch above water protects the corals to leeward, and there the island increases fast; for the birds not only settle on it, but they make their nests and rear their young, and so every year the soil increases; and then, perhaps, one cocoa-nut in its great outside shell at last is thrown on these little patches--it takes root, and becomes a tree, every year shedding its large branches, which are turned into mould as soon as they decay, and then dropping its nuts, which again take root and grow in this mould; and thus they continue, season after season, and year after year, until the island becomes as large and as thickly covered with trees as the one we are now standing upon.</s> <s sid="44" id="masterman.c19.s44">Is not this wonderful, my dear boy?</s> <s sid="45" id="masterman.c19.s45">Is not he a great and good God who can make such minute animals as these work his pleasure, and at the time he thinks fit produce such a beautiful island as this?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="masterman.c19.p24" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="masterman.c19.s46"><qs/>"Indeed he is!"<qe/> exclaimed William.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="masterman.c19.p25" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="masterman.c19.s47"><qs/>"We only need use our eyes, William, and we shall love as well as adore.</s> <s sid="48" id="masterman.c19.s48">Look at that shell--is it not beautifully marked?--could the best painter in the world equal its colouring?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="masterman.c19.p26" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="masterman.c19.s49"><qs/>"No, indeed,--I should think not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="masterman.c19.p27" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="masterman.c19.s50"><qs/>"And yet there are thousands of them in sight, and perhaps millions more in the water.</s> <s sid="51" id="masterman.c19.s51">They have not been coloured in this way to be admired, like the works of man; for this island has been till now probably without any one upon it, and no one has ever seen them.</s> <s sid="52" id="masterman.c19.s52">It makes no difference to Him, who has but to wish, and all is complete."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="masterman.c19.p28" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="masterman.c19.s53">For a few minutes after this conversation, Mr Seagrave and William were both silent.</s> <s sid="54" id="masterman.c19.s54">Mr Seagrave then rose from where he was sitting:</s> <s sid="55" id="masterman.c19.s55"><qs/>"Come, William, let us now find our way back again; we have three hours' daylight left, and shall be home in good time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="masterman.c62.p7"><s sid="14" id="masterman.c62.s14">Ready now stood upon the plank within, so as to show himself to the savages, who gave a tremendous yell, and as they advanced a dozen spears were thrown at him with so true an aim that, had he not instantly dodged behind the stockade, he must have been killed.</s> <s sid="15" id="masterman.c62.s15">Three or four spears remained quivering in the palisades, just below the top; the others went over it, and fell down inside of the stockade, at the further end.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="masterman.c62.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="masterman.c62.s16"><qs/>"Now, William, take good aim;"<qe/> but before William could fire, Mr Seagrave, who had agreed to be stationed at the corner so that he might see if the savages went round to the other side, fired his musket, and the tall chief fell to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="masterman.c62.p9"><s sid="17" id="masterman.c62.s17">Ready and William also fired, and two more of the savages were seen to drop amidst the yells of their companions.</s> <s sid="18" id="masterman.c62.s18">Juno handed up the other muskets which were ready loaded, and took those discharged, and Mrs Seagrave, having desired Caroline to take care of her little brother, and Tommy to be very quiet and good, came out, turned the key of the door upon them, and hastened to assist Juno in reloading the muskets.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="masterman.c62.p10"><s sid="19" id="masterman.c62.s19">The spears now rushed through the air, and it was well that they could fire from the stockade without exposing their persons, or they would have had but little chance.</s> <s sid="20" id="masterman.c62.s20">The yells increased, and the savages now began to attack on every quarter; the most active, who climbed like cats, actually succeeded in gaining the top of the palisades, but, as soon as their heads appeared above, they were fired at with so true an aim that they dropped down dead outside.</s> <s sid="21" id="masterman.c62.s21">This combat lasted for more than an hour, when the savages, having lost a great many men, drew off from the assault, and the parties within the stockade had time to breathe.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="masterman.c62.p14" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="masterman.c62.s26"><qs/>"I should think so too,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mr Seagrave; <sse/><qs/>"the first time that savages hear the report of firearms, they are usually thrown into great consternation."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="masterman.c62.p23" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="masterman.c62.s35"><qs/>"I filled it up to the top!"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Ready very gravely; <sse/><qs/>"the tub did not leak, that I am sure of; how can this have happened?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="masterman.c62.p24" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="masterman.c62.s36"><qs/>"Missy, I tink I know now,"<qe/><sss/> said Juno; <sse/><qs/>"you remember you send Massa Tommy, the two or three days we wash, to fetch water from the well in little bucket.</s> <s sid="37" id="masterman.c62.s37">You know how soon he come back, and how you say what good boy he was, and how you tell Massa Seagrave when he come to dinner.</s> <s sid="38" id="masterman.c62.s38">Now, Missy, I quite certain Massa Tommy no take trouble go to well, but fetch water from tub all the while, and so he empty it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="masterman.c62.p26" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="masterman.c62.s41"><qs/>"I go speak Massa Tommy,"<qe/> said Juno, running to the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="masterman.c62.p28"><s sid="43" id="masterman.c62.s43">Mr Seagrave shook his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="masterman.c62.p29"><s sid="44" id="masterman.c62.s44">The fact was, that they all perceived the danger of their position: if the savages did not leave the island, they would perish of thirst or have to surrender; and in the latter case, all their lives would most certainly be sacrificed.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="masterman.c62.p30"><s sid="45" id="masterman.c62.s45">Juno now returned: her suspicions were but too true.</s> <s sid="46" id="masterman.c62.s46">Tommy, pleased with the praise of being so quick in bringing the water, had taken out the spigot of the cask, and drawn it all off.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="masterman.c62.p31" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="masterman.c62.s47"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> observed Mr Seagrave, <sse/><qs/>"it is the will of Heaven that all our careful arrangements and preparations against this attack should be defeated by the idleness of a child, and we must submit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="masterman.c62.p32" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="masterman.c62.s48"><qs/>"Very true, sir,"<qe/><sss/> replied Ready; <sse/><qs/>"all our hopes now are that the savages may be tired out, and leave the island."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="masterman.c62.p35"><s sid="51" id="masterman.c62.s51">Mrs Seagrave said she would go and examine, and went away into the house accompanied by Juno.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="masterman.c62.p36" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="masterman.c62.s52"><qs/>"This is a very bad business, Ready,"<qe/> observed Mr Seagrave.</s> <s sid="53" id="masterman.c62.s53"><qs/>"What would we give for a shower of rain now, that we might catch the falling drops!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="masterman.c62.p37" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="masterman.c62.s54"><qs/>"There are no signs of it, sir,"<qe/><sss/> replied Ready; <sse/><qs/>"we must, however, put our confidence in One who will not forsake us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="masterman.c62.p40" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="masterman.c62.s58"><qs/>"Why, what can we do, Ready?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="masterman.c62.p41" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="masterman.c62.s59"><qs/>"In the first place, sir, by nailing planks from cocoa-nut tree to cocoa-nut tree above the present stockade, we may make a great portion of it much higher, and more difficult to climb over.</s> <s sid="60" id="masterman.c62.s60">Some of them were nearly in, this time.</s> <s sid="61" id="masterman.c62.s61">If we do that, we shall not have so large a space to watch over and defend; and then we must contrive to have a large fire ready for lighting, that we may not have to fight altogether in the dark.</s> <s sid="62" id="masterman.c62.s62">It will give them some advantage in looking through the palisades, and seeing where we are, but they cannot well drive their spears through, so it is no great matter.</s> <s sid="63" id="masterman.c62.s63">We must make the fire in the centre of the stockade, and have plenty of tar in it, to make it burn bright, and we must not, of course, light it until after we are attacked.</s> <s sid="64" id="masterman.c62.s64">We shall then see where they are trying for an entrance, and where to aim with our muskets."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="masterman.c62.p42" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="masterman.c62.s65"><qs/>"The idea is very good, Ready,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr Seagrave; <sse/><qs/>"if it had not been for this unfortunate want of water, I really should be sanguine of beating them off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="masterman.c62.p43" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="masterman.c62.s66"><qs/>"We may suffer very much, Mr Seagrave, I have no doubt; but who knows what the morrow may bring forth?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="masterman.c62.p46"><s sid="71" id="masterman.c62.s71">As Ready had supposed, no further attack was made by the savages on that day, and he, William, and Mr Seagrave, were very busy making their arrangements; they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above the stockade, so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five feet higher, and almost impossible to climb up; and they prepared a large fire in a tar-barrel full of cocoa-nut leaves mixed with wood and tar, so as to burn fiercely.</s> <s sid="72" id="masterman.c62.s72">Dinner or supper they had none, for there was nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle, and, by Ready's advice, they did not eat, as it would only increase their desire to drink.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="masterman.c62.p47" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="masterman.c62.s73">The poor children suffered much; and little Albert wailed and cried for <qs/>"water, water."<qe/></s> <s sid="74" id="masterman.c62.s74">Ready remained on the look-out; indeed, everything was so miserable inside of the house, that they were all glad to go out of it; they could do no good, and poor Mrs Seagrave had a difficult and most painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe privation, for the weather was still very warm and sultry.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="masterman.c63.p1"><s sid="1" id="masterman.c63.s1">But the moaning of the children was very soon after dusk drowned by the yells of the savages, who, as Ready had prognosticated, now advanced to the night attack.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c63.p2"><s sid="2" id="masterman.c63.s2">Every part of the stockade was at once assailed, and their attempts now made were to climb into it; a few spears were occasionally thrown, but it was evident that the object was to obtain an entrance by dint of numbers.</s> <s sid="3" id="masterman.c63.s3">It was well that Ready had taken the precaution of nailing the deal planks above the original stockade, or there is little doubt but that the savages would have gained their object; as it was, before the flames of the fire, which Juno had lighted by Ready's order, gave them sufficient light, three or four savages had climbed up and had been shot by William and Mr Seagrave, as they were on the top of the stockade.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c63.p3"><s sid="4" id="masterman.c63.s4">When the fire burnt brightly, the savages outside were more easily aimed at, and a great many fell in their attempts to get over.</s> <s sid="5" id="masterman.c63.s5">The attack continued more than an hour, when at last, satisfied that they could not succeed, the savages once more withdrew, carrying with them, as before, their dead and wounded.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c66.p2"><s sid="5" id="masterman.c66.s5">When Captain Osborn was put into the boat by Mackintosh and the seamen of the _Pacific_, he was still insensible; but he gradually recovered, and after a stormy night, Captain Osborn was so far recovered as to hear from Mackintosh what had taken place, and why it was that he found himself in an open boat at sea.</s> <s sid="6" id="masterman.c66.s6">The next morning the wind moderated, and they were fortunate enough to fall in with a vessel bound to Van Diemen's Land, which took them all on board.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c66.p3"><s sid="7" id="masterman.c66.s7">From the account given by Mackintosh, Captain Osborn had no doubt in his mind but that the Seagrave family had perished, and the loss of the vessel, with them on board, was duly reported to the owners.</s> <s sid="8" id="masterman.c66.s8">When at Van Diemen's Land, Captain Osborn was so much taken with the beauty and fertility of the country, and perhaps not so well inclined to go to sea again after such danger as he had incurred in the last voyage, that he resolved to purchase land and settle there.</s> <s sid="9" id="masterman.c66.s9">He did so, and had already stocked his farm with cattle, and had gone round to Sydney in a schooner to await the arrival of a large order from England which he had sent for, when the brig arrived and reported the existence of some white people on the small island, and also that they had hoisted a flag with the name _Pacific_ worked on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="masterman.c66.p4"><s sid="10" id="masterman.c66.s10">Captain Osborn, hearing this, went to the master of the brig, and questioned him.</s> <s sid="11" id="masterman.c66.s11">He found the latitude and longitude of the island to be not far from that of the ship when she was deserted, and he was now convinced that, by some miracle, the Seagrave family had been preserved.</s> <s sid="12" id="masterman.c66.s12">He therefore went to the Governor of New South Wales, and made him acquainted with the facts which had been established, and the Governor instantly replied, that the government armed schooner was at his service, if he would himself go in quest of his former shipmates.</s> <s sid="13" id="masterman.c66.s13">Inconvenient as the absence at that time was to Captain Osborn, he at once acquiesced, and in a few days the schooner sailed for her destination.</s> <s sid="14" id="masterman.c66.s14">She arrived off the island on the same morning that the fleet of canoes with the savages effected their landing, and when William made the remark to Ready as they were hastening into the stockade, that there was another vessel under sail off the garden-point, had Ready had time to put his eye to the telescope, he would have discovered that it was the schooner.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="masterman.c66.p5"><s sid="15" id="masterman.c66.s15">The schooner stood in to the reefs, and then hauled off again, that she might send her boat in to sound for an anchorage.</s> <s sid="16" id="masterman.c66.s16">The boat, when sounding, perceived the canoes and the savages, and afterwards heard the report of firearms on the first attack.</s> <s sid="17" id="masterman.c66.s17">On her return on board the schooner, they stated what they had seen and heard, and their idea that the white people on the island were being attacked by the savages.</s> <s sid="18" id="masterman.c66.s18">As the boat did not return on board till near dusk, they had not time to canvas, the question when the night attack was made, and they again heard the firing of the muskets.</s> <s sid="19" id="masterman.c66.s19">This made Captain Osborn most anxious to land as soon as possible, but as the savages were in such numbers, and the crew of the schooner did not consist of more than twenty-five men, the commander considered it was rash to make the attempt.</s> <s sid="20" id="masterman.c66.s20">He did, however, show the utmost anxiety to bring his schooner to an anchor, so as to protect his men, and then agreed that they should land.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="masterman.c66.p11"><s sid="31" id="masterman.c66.s31">The old man then joined his hands across his breast, and remained for some time in silent prayer.</s> <s sid="32" id="masterman.c66.s32">Then he bade them farewell in a faint voice, which at last was changed to a mere whisper.</s> <s sid="33" id="masterman.c66.s33">They still remained, in silence and in tears, standing round him, William only kneeling and holding his hand, when the old man's head fell back, and he was no more!</s> </p>
