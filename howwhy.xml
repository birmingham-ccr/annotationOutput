<p pid="2" id="howwhy.c0.p2"><s sid="2" id="howwhy.c0.s2">PREFACE.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="howwhy.c0.p3"><s sid="3" id="howwhy.c0.s3">My dear boys,--When I was your age, there were no such children's books as there are now.</s> <s sid="4" id="howwhy.c0.s4">Those which we had were few and dull, and the pictures in them ugly and mean: while you have your choice of books without number, clear, amusing, and pretty, as well as really instructive, on subjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by a few learned men, and very little understood even by them.</s> <s sid="5" id="howwhy.c0.s5">So if mere reading of books would make wise men, you ought to grow up much wiser than us old fellows.</s> <s sid="6" id="howwhy.c0.s6">But mere reading of wise books will not make you wise men: you must use for yourselves the tools with which books are made wise; and that is--your eyes, and ears, and common sense.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="howwhy.c0.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="howwhy.c0.s7">Now, among those very stupid old-fashioned boys' books was one which taught me that; and therefore I am more grateful to it than if it had been as full of wonderful pictures as all the natural history books you ever saw.</s> <s sid="8" id="howwhy.c0.s8">Its name was _Evenings at Home_; and in it was a story called <qs/>"Eyes and no Eyes;"<qe/> a regular old-fashioned, prim, sententious story; and it began thus:--</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="howwhy.c0.p5" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="howwhy.c0.s9"><qs/>"Well, Robert, where have you been walking this afternoon?"<qe/> said Mr. Andrews to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="howwhy.c0.p6"><s sid="10" id="howwhy.c0.s10">Oh--Robert had been to Broom Heath, and round by Camp Mount, and home through the meadows.</s> <s sid="11" id="howwhy.c0.s11">But it was very dull.</s> <s sid="12" id="howwhy.c0.s12">He hardly saw a single person.</s> <s sid="13" id="howwhy.c0.s13">He had much rather have gone by the turnpike-road.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="howwhy.c0.p7"><s sid="14" id="howwhy.c0.s14">Presently in comes Master William, the other pupil, dressed, I suppose, as wretched boys used to be dressed forty years ago, in a frill collar, and skeleton monkey-jacket, and tight trousers buttoned over it, and hardly coming down to his ancles; and low shoes, which always came off in sticky ground; and terribly dirty and wet he is: but he never (he says) had such a pleasant walk in his life; and he has brought home his handkerchief (for boys had no pockets in those days much bigger than key- holes) full of curiosities.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="howwhy.c0.p8"><s sid="15" id="howwhy.c0.s15">He has got a piece of mistletoe, wants to know what it is; and he has seen a woodpecker, and a wheat-ear, and gathered strange flowers on the heath; and hunted a peewit because he thought its wing was broken, till of course it led him into a bog, and very wet he got.</s> <s sid="16" id="howwhy.c0.s16">But he did not mind it, because he fell in with an old man cutting turf, who told him all about turf-cutting, and gave him a dead adder.</s> <s sid="17" id="howwhy.c0.s17">And then he went up a hill, and saw a grand prospect; and wanted to go again, and make out the geography of the country from Cary's old county maps, which were the only maps in those days.</s> <s sid="18" id="howwhy.c0.s18">And then, because the hill was called Camp Mount, he looked for a Roman camp, and found one; and then he went down to the river, saw twenty things more; and so on, and so on, till he had brought home curiosities enough, and thoughts enough, to last him a week.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="howwhy.c0.p9"><s sid="19" id="howwhy.c0.s19">Whereon Mr. Andrews, who seems to have been a very sensible old gentleman, tells him all about his curiosities: and then it comes out--if you will believe it--that Master William has been over the very same ground as Master Robert, who saw nothing at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="howwhy.c0.p10"><s sid="20" id="howwhy.c0.s20">Whereon Mr. Andrews says, wisely enough, in his solemn old-fashioned way,--</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="howwhy.c0.p11" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="howwhy.c0.s21"><qs/>"So it is.</s> <s sid="22" id="howwhy.c0.s22">One man walks through the world with his eyes open, another with his eyes shut; and upon this difference depends all the superiority of knowledge which one man acquires over another.</s> <s sid="23" id="howwhy.c0.s23">I have known sailors who had been in all the quarters of the world, and could tell you nothing but the signs of the tippling-houses, and the price and quality of the liquor.</s> <s sid="24" id="howwhy.c0.s24">On the other hand, Franklin could not cross the Channel without making observations useful to mankind.</s> <s sid="25" id="howwhy.c0.s25">While many a vacant thoughtless youth is whirled through Europe without gaining a single idea worth crossing the street for, the observing eye and inquiring mind find matter of improvement and delight in every ramble.</s> <s sid="26" id="howwhy.c0.s26">You, then, William, continue to use your eyes.</s> <s sid="27" id="howwhy.c0.s27">And you, Robert, learn that eyes were given to you to use."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="howwhy.c0.p12"><s sid="28" id="howwhy.c0.s28">So said Mr. Andrews: and so I say, dear boys--and so says he who has the charge of you--to you.</s> <s sid="29" id="howwhy.c0.s29">Therefore I beg all good boys among you to think over this story, and settle in their own minds whether they will be eyes or no eyes; whether they will, as they grow up, look and see for themselves what happens: or whether they will let other people look for them, or pretend to look; and dupe them, and lead them about--the blind leading the blind, till both fall into the ditch.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="howwhy.c0.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="howwhy.c0.s30">I say <qs/>"good boys;"<qe/> not merely clever boys, or prudent boys: because using your eyes, or not using them, is a question of doing Right or doing Wrong.</s> <s sid="31" id="howwhy.c0.s31">God has given you eyes; it is your duty to God to use them.</s> <s sid="32" id="howwhy.c0.s32">If your parents tried to teach you your lessons in the most agreeable way, by beautiful picture-books, would it not be ungracious, ungrateful, and altogether naughty and wrong, to shut your eyes to those pictures, and refuse to learn?</s> <s sid="33" id="howwhy.c0.s33">And is it not altogether naughty and wrong to refuse to learn from your Father in Heaven, the Great God who made all things, when he offers to teach you all day long by the most beautiful and most wonderful of all picture-books, which is simply all things which you can see, hear, and touch, from the sun and stars above your head to the mosses and insects at your feet?</s> <s sid="34" id="howwhy.c0.s34">It is your duty to learn His lessons: and it is your interest.</s> <s sid="35" id="howwhy.c0.s35">God's Book, which is the Universe, and the reading of God's Book, which is Science, can do you nothing but good, and teach you nothing but truth and wisdom.</s> <s sid="36" id="howwhy.c0.s36">God did not put this wondrous world about your young souls to tempt or to mislead them.</s> <s sid="37" id="howwhy.c0.s37">If you ask Him for a fish, he will not give you a serpent.</s> <s sid="38" id="howwhy.c0.s38">If you ask Him for bread, He will not give you a stone.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="howwhy.c0.p14"><s sid="39" id="howwhy.c0.s39">So use your eyes and your intellect, your senses and your brains, and learn what God is trying to teach you continually by them.</s> <s sid="40" id="howwhy.c0.s40">I do not mean that you must stop there, and learn nothing more.</s> <s sid="41" id="howwhy.c0.s41">Anything but that.</s> <s sid="42" id="howwhy.c0.s42">There are things which neither your senses nor your brains can tell you; and they are not only more glorious, but actually more true and more real than any things which you can see or touch.</s> <s sid="43" id="howwhy.c0.s43">But you must begin at the beginning in order to end at the end, and sow the seed if you wish to gather the fruit.</s> <s sid="44" id="howwhy.c0.s44">God has ordained that you, and every child which comes into the world, should begin by learning something of the world about him by his senses and his brain; and the better you learn what they can teach you, the more fit you will be to learn what they cannot teach you.</s> <s sid="45" id="howwhy.c0.s45">The more you try now to understand _things_, the more you will be able hereafter to understand men, and That which is above men.</s> <s sid="46" id="howwhy.c0.s46">You began to find out that truly Divine mystery, that you had a mother on earth, simply by lying soft and warm upon her bosom; and so (as Our Lord told the Jews of old) it is by watching the common natural things around you, and considering the lilies of the field, how they grow, that you will begin at least to learn that far Diviner mystery, that you have a Father in Heaven.</s> <s sid="47" id="howwhy.c0.s47">And so you will be delivered (if you will) out of the tyranny of darkness, and distrust, and fear, into God's free kingdom of light, and faith, and love; and will be safe from the venom of that tree which is more deadly than the fabled upas of the East.</s> <s sid="48" id="howwhy.c0.s48">Who planted that tree I know not, it was planted so long ago: but surely it is none of God's planting, neither of the Son of God: yet it grows in all lands and in all climes, and sends its hidden suckers far and wide, even (unless we be watchful) into your hearts and mine.</s> <s sid="49" id="howwhy.c0.s49">And its name is the Tree of Unreason, whose roots are conceit and ignorance, and its juices folly and death.</s> <s sid="50" id="howwhy.c0.s50">It drops its venom into the finest brains; and makes them call sense, nonsense; and nonsense, sense; fact, fiction; and fiction, fact.</s> <s sid="51" id="howwhy.c0.s51">It drops its venom into the tenderest hearts, alas! and makes them call wrong, right; and right, wrong; love, cruelty; and cruelty, love.</s> <s sid="52" id="howwhy.c0.s52">Some say that the axe is laid to the root of it just now, and that it is already tottering to its fall: while others say that it is growing stronger than ever, and ready to spread its upas-shade over the whole earth.</s> <s sid="53" id="howwhy.c0.s53">For my part, I know not, save that all shall be as God wills.</s> <s sid="54" id="howwhy.c0.s54">The tree has been cut down already again and again; and yet has always thrown out fresh shoots and dropped fresh poison from its boughs.</s> <s sid="55" id="howwhy.c0.s55">But this at least I know: that any little child, who will use the faculties God has given him, may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb beneath his feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="howwhy.c0.p15"><s sid="56" id="howwhy.c0.s56">There, you do not understand me, my boys; and the best prayer I can offer for you is, perhaps, that you should never need to understand me: but if that sore need should come, and that poison should begin to spread its mist over your brains and hearts, then you will be proof against it; just in proportion as you have used the eyes and the common sense which God has given you, and have considered the lilies of the field, how they grow.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I. THE GLEN</title>
<p pid="1" id="howwhy.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="howwhy.c1.s1">You find it dull walking up here upon Hartford Bridge Flat this sad November day?</s> <s sid="2" id="howwhy.c1.s2">Well, I do not deny that the moor looks somewhat dreary, though dull it need never be.</s> <s sid="3" id="howwhy.c1.s3">Though the fog is clinging to the fir-trees, and creeping among the heather, till you cannot see as far as Minley Corner, hardly as far as Bramshill woods--and all the Berkshire hills are as invisible as if it was a dark midnight--yet there is plenty to be seen here at our very feet.</s> <s sid="4" id="howwhy.c1.s4">Though there is nothing left for you to pick, and all the flowers are dead and brown, except here and there a poor half-withered scrap of bottle-heath, and nothing left for you to catch either, for the butterflies and insects are all dead too, except one poor old Daddy-long-legs, who sits upon that piece of turf, boring a hole with her tail to lay her eggs in, before the frost catches her and ends her like the rest: though all things, I say, seem dead, yet there is plenty of life around you, at your feet, I may almost say in the very stones on which you tread.</s> <s sid="5" id="howwhy.c1.s5">And though the place itself be dreary enough, a sheet of flat heather and a little glen in it, with banks of dead fern, and a brown bog between them, and a few fir-trees struggling up--yet, if you only have eyes to see it, that little bit of glen is beautiful and wonderful,--so beautiful and so wonderful and so cunningly devised, that it took thousands of years to make it; and it is not, I believe, half finished yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="howwhy.c1.p2"><s sid="6" id="howwhy.c1.s6">How do I know all that?</s> <s sid="7" id="howwhy.c1.s7">Because a fairy told it me; a fairy who lives up here upon the moor, and indeed in most places else, if people have but eyes to see her.</s> <s sid="8" id="howwhy.c1.s8">What is her name?</s> <s sid="9" id="howwhy.c1.s9">I cannot tell.</s> <s sid="10" id="howwhy.c1.s10">The best name that I can give her (and I think it must be something like her real name, because she will always answer if you call her by it patiently and reverently) is Madam How.</s> <s sid="11" id="howwhy.c1.s11">She will come in good time, if she is called, even by a little child.</s> <s sid="12" id="howwhy.c1.s12">And she will let us see her at her work, and, what is more, teach us to copy her.</s> <s sid="13" id="howwhy.c1.s13">But there is another fairy here likewise, whom we can hardly hope to see.</s> <s sid="14" id="howwhy.c1.s14">Very thankful should we be if she lifted even the smallest corner of her veil, and showed us but for a moment if it were but her finger tip--so beautiful is she, and yet so awful too.</s> <s sid="15" id="howwhy.c1.s15">But that sight, I believe, would not make us proud, as if we had had some great privilege.</s> <s sid="16" id="howwhy.c1.s16">No, my dear child: it would make us feel smaller, and meaner, and more stupid and more ignorant than we had ever felt in our lives before; at the same time it would make us wiser than ever we were in our lives before--that one glimpse of the great glory of her whom we call Lady Why.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="howwhy.c1.p3"><s sid="17" id="howwhy.c1.s17">But I will say more of her presently.</s> <s sid="18" id="howwhy.c1.s18">We must talk first with Madam How, and perhaps she may help us hereafter to see Lady Why.</s> <s sid="19" id="howwhy.c1.s19">For she is the servant, and Lady Why is the mistress; though she has a Master over her again--whose name I leave for you to guess.</s> <s sid="20" id="howwhy.c1.s20">You have heard it often already, and you will hear it again, for ever and ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="howwhy.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="howwhy.c1.s21">But of one thing I must warn you, that you must not confound Madam How and Lady Why.</s> <s sid="22" id="howwhy.c1.s22">Many people do it, and fall into great mistakes thereby,--mistakes that even a little child, if it would think, need not commit.</s> <s sid="23" id="howwhy.c1.s23">But really great philosophers sometimes make this mistake about Why and How; and therefore it is no wonder if other people make it too, when they write children's books about the wonders of nature, and call them <qs/>"Why and Because,"<qe/><sss/> or <sse/><qs/>"The Reason Why."<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="howwhy.c1.s24">The books are very good books, and you should read and study them: but they do not tell you really <qs/>"Why and Because,"<qe/><sss/> but only <sse/><qs/>"How and So."<qe/></s> <s sid="25" id="howwhy.c1.s25">They do not tell you the "Reason Why" things happen, but only <qs/>"The Way in which they happen."<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="howwhy.c1.s26">However, I must not blame these good folks, for I have made the same mistake myself often, and may do it again: but all the more shame to me.</s> <s sid="27" id="howwhy.c1.s27">For see--you know perfectly the difference between How and Why, when you are talking about yourself.</s> <s sid="28" id="howwhy.c1.s28">If I ask you, <qs/>"Why did we go out to-day?"<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="howwhy.c1.s29">You would not answer, <qs/>"Because we opened the door."<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="howwhy.c1.s30">That is the answer to <qs/>"How did we go out?"<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="howwhy.c1.s31">The answer to Why did we go out is, <qs/>"Because we chose to take a walk."<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="howwhy.c1.s32">Now when we talk about other things beside ourselves, we must remember this same difference between How and Why.</s> <s sid="33" id="howwhy.c1.s33">If I ask you, <qs/>"Why does fire burn you?"<qe/><sls/> you would answer, I suppose, being a little boy, <sle/><qs/>"Because it is hot;"<qe/> which is all you know about it.</s> <s sid="34" id="howwhy.c1.s34">But if you were a great chemist, instead of a little boy, you would be apt to answer me, I am afraid, <qs/>"Fire burns because the vibratory motion of the molecules of the heated substance communicates itself to the molecules of my skin, and so destroys their tissue;"<qe/> which is, I dare say, quite true: but it only tells us how fire burns, the way or means by which it burns; it does not tell us the reason why it burns.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="howwhy.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="howwhy.c1.s35">But you will ask, <qs/>"If that is not the reason why fire burns, what is?"<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="howwhy.c1.s36">My dear child, I do not know.</s> <s sid="37" id="howwhy.c1.s37">That is Lady Why's business, who is mistress of Mrs. How, and of you and of me; and, as I think, of all things that you ever saw, or can see, or even dream.</s> <s sid="38" id="howwhy.c1.s38">And what her reason for making fire burn may be I cannot tell.</s> <s sid="39" id="howwhy.c1.s39">But I believe on excellent grounds that her reason is a very good one.</s> <s sid="40" id="howwhy.c1.s40">If I dare to guess, I should say that one reason, at least, why fire burns, is that you may take care not to play with it, and so not only scorch your finger, but set your whole bed on fire, and perhaps the house into the bargain, as you might be tempted to do if putting your finger in the fire were as pleasant as putting sugar in your mouth.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="howwhy.c1.p7"><s sid="42" id="howwhy.c1.s42">But now that we know that How and Why are two very different matters, and must not be confounded with each other, let us look for Madam How, and see her at work making this little glen; for, as I told you, it is not half made yet.</s> <s sid="43" id="howwhy.c1.s43">One thing we shall see at once, and see it more and more clearly the older we grow; I mean her wonderful patience and diligence.</s> <s sid="44" id="howwhy.c1.s44">Madam How is never idle for an instant.</s> <s sid="45" id="howwhy.c1.s45">Nothing is too great or too small for her; and she keeps her work before her eye in the same moment, and makes every separate bit of it help every other bit.</s> <s sid="46" id="howwhy.c1.s46">She will keep the sun and stars in order, while she looks after poor old Mrs. Daddy- long-legs there and her eggs.</s> <s sid="47" id="howwhy.c1.s47">She will spend thousands of years in building up a mountain, and thousands of years in grinding it down again; and then carefully polish every grain of sand which falls from that mountain, and put it in its right place, where it will be wanted thousands of years hence; and she will take just as much trouble about that one grain of sand as she did about the whole mountain.</s> <s sid="48" id="howwhy.c1.s48">She will settle the exact place where Mrs. Daddy-long-legs shall lay her eggs, at the very same time that she is settling what shall happen hundreds of years hence in a stair millions of miles away.</s> <s sid="49" id="howwhy.c1.s49">And I really believe that Madam How knows her work so thoroughly, that the grain of sand which sticks now to your shoe, and the weight of Mrs. Daddy-long-legs' eggs at the bottom of her hole, will have an effect upon suns and stars ages after you and I are dead and gone.</s> <s sid="50" id="howwhy.c1.s50">Most patient indeed is Madam How.</s> <s sid="51" id="howwhy.c1.s51">She does not mind the least seeing her own work destroyed; she knows that it must be destroyed.</s> <s sid="52" id="howwhy.c1.s52">There is a spell upon her, and a fate, that everything she makes she must unmake again: and yet, good and wise woman as she is, she never frets, nor tires, nor fudges her work, as we say at school.</s> <s sid="53" id="howwhy.c1.s53">She takes just as much pains to make an acorn as to make a peach.</s> <s sid="54" id="howwhy.c1.s54">She takes just as much pains about the acorn which the pig eats, as about the acorn which will grow into a tall oak, and help to build a great ship.</s> <s sid="55" id="howwhy.c1.s55">She took just as much pains, again, about the acorn which you crushed under your foot just now, and which you fancy will never come to anything.</s> <s sid="56" id="howwhy.c1.s56">Madam How is wiser than that.</s> <s sid="57" id="howwhy.c1.s57">She knows that it will come to something.</s> <s sid="58" id="howwhy.c1.s58">She will find some use for it, as she finds a use for everything.</s> <s sid="59" id="howwhy.c1.s59">That acorn which you crushed will turn into mould, and that mould will go to feed the roots of some plant, perhaps next year, if it lies where it is; or perhaps it will be washed into the brook, and then into the river, and go down to the sea, and will feed the roots of some plant in some new continent ages and ages hence: and so Madam How will have her own again.</s> <s sid="60" id="howwhy.c1.s60">You dropped your stick into the river yesterday, and it floated away.</s> <s sid="61" id="howwhy.c1.s61">You were sorry, because it had cost you a great deal of trouble to cut it, and peel it, and carve a head and your name on it.</s> <s sid="62" id="howwhy.c1.s62">Madam How was not sorry, though she had taken a great deal more trouble with that stick than ever you had taken.</s> <s sid="63" id="howwhy.c1.s63">She had been three years making that stick, out of many things, sunbeams among the rest.</s> <s sid="64" id="howwhy.c1.s64">But when it fell into the river, Madam How knew that she should not lose her sunbeams nor anything else: the stick would float down the river, and on into the sea; and there, when it got heavy with the salt water, it would sink, and lodge, and be buried, and perhaps ages hence turn into coal; and ages after that some one would dig it up and burn it, and then out would come, as bright warm flame, all the sunbeams that were stored away in that stick: and so Madam How would have her own again.</s> <s sid="65" id="howwhy.c1.s65">And if that should not be the fate of your stick, still something else will happen to it just as useful in the long run; for Madam How never loses anything, but uses up all her scraps and odds and ends somehow, somewhere, somewhen, as is fit and proper for the Housekeeper of the whole Universe.</s> <s sid="66" id="howwhy.c1.s66">Indeed, Madam How is so patient that some people fancy her stupid, and think that, because she does not fall into a passion every time you steal her sweets, or break her crockery, or disarrange her furniture, therefore she does not care.</s> <s sid="67" id="howwhy.c1.s67">But I advise you as a little boy, and still more when you grow up to be a man, not to get that fancy into your head;

<p pid="3" id="howwhy.c6.p3"><s sid="20" id="howwhy.c6.s20">But did these people (savages perhaps) live when the country was icy cold?</s> <s sid="21" id="howwhy.c6.s21">Look at the bits of bone.</s> <s sid="22" id="howwhy.c6.s22">They have been split, you see, lengthways; that, I suppose, was to suck the marrow out of them, as savages do still.</s> <s sid="23" id="howwhy.c6.s23">But to what animal do the bones belong?</s> <s sid="24" id="howwhy.c6.s24">That is the question, and one which I could not have answered you, if wiser men than I am could not have told me.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="howwhy.c6.p4"><s sid="25" id="howwhy.c6.s25">They are the bones of reindeer--such reindeer as are now found only in Lapland and the half-frozen parts of North America, close to the Arctic circle, where they have six months day and six months night.</s> <s sid="26" id="howwhy.c6.s26">You have read of Laplanders, and how they drive reindeer in their sledges, and live upon reindeer milk; and you have read of Esquimaux, who hunt seals and walrus, and live in houses of ice, lighted by lamps fed with the same blubber on which they feed themselves.</s> <s sid="27" id="howwhy.c6.s27">I need not tell you about them.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="howwhy.c6.p5"><s sid="28" id="howwhy.c6.s28">Now comes the question--Whence did these flints and bones come?</s> <s sid="29" id="howwhy.c6.s29">They came out of a cave in Dordogne, in the heart of sunny France,--far away to the south, where it is hotter every summer than it was here even this summer, from among woods of box and evergreen oak, and vineyards of rich red wine.</s> <s sid="30" id="howwhy.c6.s30">In that warm land once lived savages, who hunted amid ice and snow the reindeer, and with the reindeer animals stranger still.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="howwhy.c6.p6"><s sid="31" id="howwhy.c6.s31">And now I will tell you a fairy tale: to make you understand it at all I must put it in the shape of a tale.</s> <s sid="32" id="howwhy.c6.s32">I call it a fairy tale, because it is so strange; indeed I think I ought to call it the fairy tale of all fairy tales, for by the time we get to the end of it I think it will explain to you how our forefathers got to believe in fairies, and trolls, and elves, and scratlings, and all strange little people who were said to haunt the mountains and the caves.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="howwhy.c6.p7"><s sid="33" id="howwhy.c6.s33">Well, once upon a time, so long ago that no man can tell when, the land was so much higher, that between England and Ireland, and, what is more, between England and Norway, was firm dry land.</s> <s sid="34" id="howwhy.c6.s34">The country then must have looked--at least we know it looked so in Norfolk--very like what our moors look like here.</s> <s sid="35" id="howwhy.c6.s35">There were forests of Scotch fir, and of spruce too, which is not wild in England now, though you may see plenty in every plantation.</s> <s sid="36" id="howwhy.c6.s36">There were oaks and alders, yews and sloes, just as there are in our woods now.</s> <s sid="37" id="howwhy.c6.s37">There was buck-bean in the bogs, as there is in Larmer's and Heath pond; and white and yellow water-lilies, horn-wort, and pond-weeds, just as there are now in our ponds.</s> <s sid="38" id="howwhy.c6.s38">There were wild horses, wild deer, and wild oxen, those last of an enormous size.</s> <s sid="39" id="howwhy.c6.s39">There were little yellow roe-deer, which will not surprise you, for there are hundreds and thousands in Scotland to this day; and, as you know, they will thrive well enough in our woods now.</s> <s sid="40" id="howwhy.c6.s40">There were beavers too: but that must not surprise you, for there were beavers in South Wales long after the Norman Conquest, and there are beavers still in the mountain glens of the south-east of France.</s> <s sid="41" id="howwhy.c6.s41">There were honest little water-rats too, who I dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys, nibbling the water-lily pods, thousands of years ago, as they do in our ponds now.</s> <s sid="42" id="howwhy.c6.s42">Well, so far we have come to nothing strange: but now begins the fairy tale.</s> <s sid="43" id="howwhy.c6.s43">Mixed with all these animals, there wandered about great herds of elephants and rhinoceroses; not smooth-skinned, mind, but covered with hair and wool, like those which are still found sticking out of the everlasting ice cliffs, at the mouth of the Lena and other Siberian rivers, with the flesh, and skin, and hair so fresh upon them, that the wild wolves tear it off, and snarl and growl over the carcase of monsters who were frozen up thousands of years ago.</s> <s sid="44" id="howwhy.c6.s44">And with them, stranger still, were great hippopotamuses; who came, perhaps, northward in summer time along the sea-shore and down the rivers, having spread hither all the way from Africa; for in those days, you must understand, Sicily, and Italy, and Malta--look at your map--were joined to the coast of Africa: and so it may be was the rock of Gibraltar itself; and over the sea where the Straits of Gibraltar now flow was firm dry land, over which hyaenas and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses ranged into Spain; for their bones are found at this day in the Gibraltar caves.</s> <s sid="45" id="howwhy.c6.s45">And this is the first chapter of my fairy tale.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="howwhy.c6.p8"><s sid="46" id="howwhy.c6.s46">Now while all this was going on, and perhaps before this began, the climate was getting colder year by year--we do not know how; and, what is more, the land was sinking; and it sank so deep that at last nothing was left out of the water but the tops of the mountains in Ireland, and Scotland, and Wales.</s> <s sid="47" id="howwhy.c6.s47">It sank so deep that it left beds of shells belonging to the Arctic regions nearly two thousand feet high upon the mountain side.</s> <s sid="48" id="howwhy.c6.s48">And so</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="howwhy.c6.p9" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="howwhy.c6.s49"><qs/>"It grew wondrous cold, And ice mast-high came floating by, As green as emerald."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="howwhy.c6.p10"><s sid="50" id="howwhy.c6.s50">But there were no masts then to measure the icebergs by, nor any ship nor human being there.</s> <s sid="51" id="howwhy.c6.s51">All we know is that the icebergs brought with them vast quantities of mud, which sank to the bottom, and covered up that pleasant old forest-land in what is called boulder-clay; clay full of bits of broken rock, and of blocks of stone so enormous, that nothing but an iceberg could have carried them.</s> <s sid="52" id="howwhy.c6.s52">So all the animals were drowned or driven away, and nothing was left alive perhaps, except a few little hardy plants which clung about cracks and gullies in the mountain tops; and whose descendants live there still.</s> <s sid="53" id="howwhy.c6.s53">That was a dreadful time; the worst, perhaps, of all the age of Ice; and so ends the second chapter of my fairy tale.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="howwhy.c6.p11" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="howwhy.c6.s54">Now for my third chapter.</s> <s sid="55" id="howwhy.c6.s55"><qs/>"When things come to the worst,"<qe/><sss/> says the proverb, <sse/><qs/>"they commonly mend;"<qe/> and so did this poor frozen and drowned land of England and France and Germany, though it mended very slowly.</s> <s sid="56" id="howwhy.c6.s56">The land began to rise out of the sea once more, and rose till it was perhaps as high as it had been at first, and hundreds of feet higher than it is now: but still it was very cold, covered, in Scotland at least, with one great sea of ice and glaciers descending down into the sea, as I said when I spoke to you about the Ice-Plough.</s> <s sid="57" id="howwhy.c6.s57">But as the land rose, and grew warmer too, while it rose, the wild beasts who had been driven out by the great drowning came gradually back again.</s> <s sid="58" id="howwhy.c6.s58">As the bottom of the old icy sea turned into dry land, and got covered with grasses, and weeds, and shrubs once more, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, oxen--sometimes the same species, sometimes slightly different ones--returned to France, and then to England (for there was no British Channel then to stop them); and with them came other strange animals, especially the great Irish elk, as he is called, as large as the largest horse, with horns sometimes ten feet across.</s> <s sid="59" id="howwhy.c6.s59">A pair of those horns with the skull you have seen yourself, and can judge what a noble animal he must have been.</s> <s sid="60" id="howwhy.c6.s60">Enormous bears came too, and hyaenas, and a tiger or lion (I cannot say which), as large as the largest Bengal tiger now to be seen in India.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="howwhy.c6.p12"><s sid="61" id="howwhy.c6.s61">And in those days--we cannot, of course, exactly say when--there came--first I suppose into the south and east of France, and then gradually onward into England and Scotland and Ireland--creatures without any hair to keep them warm, or scales to defend them, without horns or tusks to fight with, or teeth to worry and bite; the weakest you would have thought of the beasts, and yet stronger than all the animals, because they were Men, with reasonable souls.</s> <s sid="62" id="howwhy.c6.s62">Whence they came we cannot tell, nor why; perhaps from mere hunting after food, and love of wandering and being independent and alone.</s> <s sid="63" id="howwhy.c6.s63">Perhaps they came into that icy land for fear of stronger and cleverer people than themselves; for we have no proof, my child, none at all, that they were the first men that trod this earth.</s> <s sid="64" id="howwhy.c6.s64">But be that as it may, they came; and so cunning were these savage men, and so brave likewise, though they had no iron among them, only flint and sharpened bones, yet they contrived to kill and eat the mammoths, and the giant oxen, and the wild horses, and the reindeer, and to hold their own against the hyaenas, and tigers, and bears, simply because they had wits, and the dumb animals had none.</s> <s sid="65" id="howwhy.c6.s65">And that is the strangest part to me of all my fairy tale.</s> <s sid="66" id="howwhy.c6.s66">For what a man's wits are, and why he has them, and therefore is able to invent and to improve, while even the cleverest ape has none, and therefore can invent and improve nothing, and therefore cannot better himself, but must remain from father to son, and father to son again, a stupid, pitiful, ridiculous ape, while men can go on civilising themselves, and growing richer and more comfortable, wiser and happier, year by year--how that comes to pass, I say, is to me a wonder and a prodigy and a miracle, stranger than all the most fantastic marvels you ever read in fairy tales.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="howwhy.c6.p13"><s sid="67" id="howwhy.c6.s67">You may find the flint weapons which these old savages used buried in many a gravel-pit up and down France and the south of England; but you will find none here, for the gravel here was made (I am told) at the beginning of the ice-time, before the north of England sunk into the sea, and therefore long, long before men came into this land.</s> <s sid="68" id="howwhy.c6.s68">But most of their remains are found in caves which water has eaten out of the limestone rocks, like that famous cave of Kent's Hole at Torquay.</s> <s sid="69" id="howwhy.c6.s69">In it, and in many another cave, lie the bones of animals which the savages ate, and cracked to get the marrow out of them, mixed up with their flint-weapons and bone harpoons, and sometimes with burnt ashes and with round stones, used perhaps to heat water, as savages do now, all baked together into a hard paste or breccia by the lime.</s> <s sid="70" id="howwhy.c6.s70">These are in the water, and are often covered with a floor of stalagmite which has dripped from the roof above and hardened into stone.</s> <s sid="71" id="howwhy.c6.s71">Of these caves and their beautiful wonders I must tell you another day.</s> <s sid="72" id="howwhy.c6.s72">We must keep now to our fairy tale.</s> <s sid="73" id="howwhy.c6.s73">But in these caves, no doubt, the savages lived; for not only have weapons been found in them, but actually drawings scratched (I suppose with flint) on bone or mammoth ivory--drawings of elk, and bull, and horse, and ibex--and one, which was found in France, of the great mammoth himself, the woolly elephant, with a mane on his shoulders like a lion's mane.</s> <s sid="74" id="howwhy.c6.s74">So you see that one of the earliest fancies of this strange creature, called man, was to draw, as you and your schoolfellows love to draw, and copy what you see, you know not why.</s> <s sid="75" id="howwhy.c6.s75">Remember that.</s> <s sid="76" id="howwhy.c6.s76">You like to draw; but why you like it neither you nor any man can tell.</s> <s sid="77" id="howwhy.c6.s77">It is one of the mysteries of human nature; and that poor savage clothed in skins, dirty it may be, and more ignorant than you (happily) can conceive, when he sat scratching on ivory in the cave the figures of the animals he hunted, was proving thereby that he had the same wonderful and mysterious human nature as you--that he was the kinsman of every painter and sculptor who ever felt it a delight and duty to copy the beautiful works of God.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="howwhy.c6.p14" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="howwhy.c6.s78">Sometimes, again, especially in Denmark, these savages have left behind upon the shore mounds of dirt, which are called there <qs/>"kjokken-moddings"<qe/>--"kitchen-middens" as they would say in Scotland, "kitchen-dirtheaps" as we should say here down South--and a very good name for them that is; for they are made up of the shells of oysters, cockles, mussels, and periwinkles, and other shore-shells besides, on which those poor creatures fed; and mingled with them are broken bones of beasts, and fishes, and birds, and flint knives, and axes, and sling stones; and here and there hearths, on which they have cooked their meals in some rough way.</s> <s sid="79" id="howwhy.c6.s79">And that is nearly all we know about them; but this we know from the size of certain of the shells, and from other reasons which you would not understand, that these mounds were made an enormous time ago, when the water of the Baltic Sea was far more salt than it is now.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="howwhy.c6.p15"><s sid="80" id="howwhy.c6.s80">But what has all this to do with my fairy tale?</s> <s sid="81" id="howwhy.c6.s81">This:--</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="howwhy.c6.p16"><s sid="82" id="howwhy.c6.s82">Suppose that these people, after all, had been fairies?</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="howwhy.c6.p17"><s sid="83" id="howwhy.c6.s83">I am in earnest.</s> <s sid="84" id="howwhy.c6.s84">Of course, I do not mean that these folk could make themselves invisible, or that they had any supernatural powers--any more, at least, than you and I have--or that they were anything but savages; but this I do think, that out of old stories of these savages grew up the stories of fairies, elves, and trolls, and scratlings, and cluricaunes, and ogres, of which you have read so many.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="howwhy.c6.p18"><s sid="85" id="howwhy.c6.s85">When stronger and bolder people, like the Irish, and the Highlanders of Scotland, and the Gauls of France, came northward with their bronze and iron weapons; and still more, when our own forefathers, the Germans and the Norsemen, came, these poor little savages with their flint arrows and axes, were no match for them, and had to run away northward, or to be all killed out; for people were fierce and cruel in those old times, and looked on every one of a different race from themselves as a natural enemy.</s> <s sid="86" id="howwhy.c6.s86">They had not learnt--alas! too many have not learned it yet--that all men are brothers for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.</s> <s sid="87" id="howwhy.c6.s87">So these poor savages were driven out, till none were left, save the little Lapps up in the north of Norway, where they live to this day.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="howwhy.c6.p19"><s sid="88" id="howwhy.c6.s88">But stories of them, and of how they dwelt in caves, and had strange customs, and used poisoned weapons, and how the elf-bolts (as their flint arrow-heads are still called) belonged to them, lingered on, and were told round the fire on winter nights and added to, and played with half in fun, till a hundred legends sprang up about them, which used once to be believed by grown-up folk, but which now only amuse children.</s> <s sid="89" id="howwhy.c6.s89">And because some of these savages were very short, as the Lapps and Esquimaux are now, the story grew of their being so small that they could make themselves invisible; and because others of them were (but probably only a few) very tall and terrible, the story grew that there were giants in that old world, like that famous Gogmagog, whom Brutus and his Britons met (so old fables tell), when they landed first at Plymouth, and fought him, and threw him over the cliff.</s> <s sid="90" id="howwhy.c6.s90">Ogres, too--of whom you read in fairy tales--I am afraid that there were such people once, even here in Europe; strong and terrible savages, who ate human beings.</s> <s sid="91" id="howwhy.c6.s91">Of course, the legends and tales about them became ridiculous and exaggerated as they passed from mouth to mouth over the Christmas fire, in the days when no one could read or write.</s> <s sid="92" id="howwhy.c6.s92">But that the tales began by being true any one may well believe who knows how many cannibal savages there are in the world even now.</s> <s sid="93" id="howwhy.c6.s93">I think that, if ever there was an ogre in the world, he must have been very like a certain person who lived, or was buried, in a cave in the Neanderthal, between Elberfeld and Dusseldorf, on the Lower Rhine.</s> <s sid="94" id="howwhy.c6.s94">The skull and bones which were found there (and which are very famous now among scientific men) belonged to a personage whom I should have been very sorry to meet, and still more to let you meet, in the wild forest; to a savage of enormous strength of limb (and I suppose of jaw) likewise</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="howwhy.c12.p36"><s sid="61" id="howwhy.c12.s61">Then icebergs would break off from that cliff, and carry all the dirt and stones out to sea, perhaps hundreds of miles away, instead of letting it drop here in a heap; and what did fall in a heap here the sea would wash down at once, and smooth it over the sea-bottom, and never let it pile up in a huge bank like that.</s> <s sid="62" id="howwhy.c12.s62">Do you understand?</s> </p>
