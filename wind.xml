<title>CHAPTER I. THE HAY-LOFT</title>
<p pid="1" id="wind.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c1.s1">I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c1.s2">An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there, and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer, and drowned themselves.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c1.s3">My story is not the same as his.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c1.s4">I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c1.s5">I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c1.p2"><s sid="6" id="wind.c1.s6">He lived in a low room over a coach-house; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind, as his mother very well knew.</s> <s sid="7" id="wind.c1.s7">For one side of the room was built only of boards, and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c1.s8">And then let them settle between them which was the sharper!</s> <s sid="9" id="wind.c1.s9">I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse, and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind.</s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c1.s10">Still, this room was not very cold, except when the north wind blew stronger than usual: the room I have to do with now was always cold, except in summer, when the sun took the matter into his own hands.</s> <s sid="11" id="wind.c1.s11">Indeed, I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wind.c1.p3"><s sid="12" id="wind.c1.s12">And when little Diamond--but stop:</s> <s sid="13" id="wind.c1.s13">I must tell you that his father, who was a coachman, had named him after a favourite horse, and his mother had had no objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay there in bed, he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark, or moving sleepily in their dreams.</s> <s sid="14" id="wind.c1.s14">For Diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it, because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house; and Diamond's father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed, because he was a quiet horse, and did not go to sleep standing, but lay down like a reasonable creature.</s> <s sid="15" id="wind.c1.s15">But, although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night, and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind, he could not help wondering whether, if the wind should blow the house down, and he were to fall through into the manger, old Diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown.</s> <s sid="16" id="wind.c1.s16">And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long, yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake, and then young Diamond knew what o'clock it was, or at least what was to be done next, which was--to go to sleep again as fast as he could.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wind.c1.p4"><s sid="17" id="wind.c1.s17">There was hay at his feet and hay at his head, piled up in great trusses to the very roof.</s> <s sid="18" id="wind.c1.s18">Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings, which looked as if it had been sawn out for him, that he could reach his bed at all.</s> <s sid="19" id="wind.c1.s19">For the stock of hay was, of course, always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow.</s> <s sid="20" id="wind.c1.s20">Sometimes the whole space of the loft, with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in, would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard.</s> <s sid="21" id="wind.c1.s21">Sometimes, when his mother had undressed him in her room, and told him to trot to bed by himself, he would creep into the heart of the hay, and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind, and how warm it was inside there in his bed, and how he could go to it when he pleased, only he wouldn't just yet; he would get a little colder first.</s> <s sid="22" id="wind.c1.s22">And ever as he grew colder, his bed would grow warmer, till at last he would scramble out of the hay, shoot like an arrow into his bed, cover himself up, and snuggle down, thinking what a happy boy he was.</s> <s sid="23" id="wind.c1.s23">He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall, and blew about him all night.</s> <s sid="24" id="wind.c1.s24">For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick, and on the other side of them was the north wind.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wind.c1.p5"><s sid="25" id="wind.c1.s25">Now, as I have already said, these boards were soft and crumbly.</s> <s sid="26" id="wind.c1.s26">To be sure, they were tarred on the outside, yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber.</s> <s sid="27" id="wind.c1.s27">Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it, little Diamond found one night, after he lay down, that a knot had come out of one of them, and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion.</s> <s sid="28" id="wind.c1.s28">Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right; so he jumped out of bed again, got a little strike of hay, twisted it up, folded it in the middle, and, having thus made it into a cork, stuck it into the hole in the wall.</s> <s sid="29" id="wind.c1.s29">But the wind began to blow loud and angrily, and, as Diamond was falling asleep, out blew his cork and hit him on the nose, just hard enough to wake him up quite, and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole.</s> <s sid="30" id="wind.c1.s30">He searched for his hay-cork, found it, stuck it in harder, and was just dropping off once more, when, pop! with an angry whistle behind it, the cork struck him again, this time on the cheek.</s> <s sid="31" id="wind.c1.s31">Up he rose once more, made a fresh stopple of hay, and corked the hole severely.</s> <s sid="32" id="wind.c1.s32">But he was hardly down again before--pop! it came on his forehead.</s> <s sid="33" id="wind.c1.s33">He gave it up, drew the clothes above his head, and was soon fast asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wind.c1.p6"><s sid="34" id="wind.c1.s34">Although the next day was very stormy, Diamond forgot all about the hole, for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair, a three-legged stool, and a blanket, and then sitting in it.</s> <s sid="35" id="wind.c1.s35">His mother, however, discovered it, and pasted a bit of brown paper over it, so that, when Diamond had snuggled down the next night, he had no occasion to think of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wind.c1.p7"><s sid="36" id="wind.c1.s36">Presently, however, he lifted his head and listened.</s> <s sid="37" id="wind.c1.s37">Who could that be talking to him?</s> <s sid="38" id="wind.c1.s38">The wind was rising again, and getting very loud, and full of rushes and whistles.</s> <s sid="39" id="wind.c1.s39">He was sure some one was talking--and very near him, too, it was.</s> <s sid="40" id="wind.c1.s40">But he was not frightened, for he had not yet learned how to be; so he sat up and hearkened.</s> <s sid="41" id="wind.c1.s41">At last the voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded a little angry, appeared to come from the back of the bed.</s> <s sid="42" id="wind.c1.s42">He crept nearer to it, and laid his ear against the wall.</s> <s sid="43" id="wind.c1.s43">Then he heard nothing but the wind, which sounded very loud indeed.</s> <s sid="44" id="wind.c1.s44">The moment, however, that he moved his head from the wall, he heard the voice again, close to his ear.</s> <s sid="45" id="wind.c1.s45">He felt about with his hand, and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole.</s> <s sid="46" id="wind.c1.s46">Against this he laid his ear, and then he heard the voice quite distinctly.</s> <s sid="47" id="wind.c1.s47">There was, in fact, a little corner of the paper loose, and through that, as from a mouth in the wall, the voice came.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wind.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="wind.c1.s48"><qs/>"What do you mean, little boy--closing up my window?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wind.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="wind.c1.s49"><qs/>"What window?"<qe/> asked Diamond.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wind.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="wind.c1.s50"><qs/>"You stuffed hay into it three times last night.</s> <s sid="51" id="wind.c1.s51">I had to blow it out again three times."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wind.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="wind.c1.s54"><qs/>"I did not say it was a window:</s> <s sid="55" id="wind.c1.s55">I said it was my window."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wind.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="wind.c1.s56"><qs/>"But it can't be a window, because windows are holes to see out of."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wind.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="wind.c1.s57"><qs/>"Well, that's just what I made this window for."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wind.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="wind.c1.s58"><qs/>"But you are outside: you can't want a window."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wind.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="wind.c1.s59"><qs/>"You are quite mistaken.</s> <s sid="60" id="wind.c1.s60">Windows are to see out of, you say.</s> <s sid="61" id="wind.c1.s61">Well, I'm in my house, and I want windows to see out of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wind.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="wind.c1.s62"><qs/>"But you've made a window into my bed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wind.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="wind.c1.s63"><qs/>"Well, your mother has got three windows into my dancing room, and you have three into my garret."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="wind.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="wind.c1.s64"><qs/>"But I heard father say, when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall, that it was against the law, for it would look into Mr. Dyves's garden."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wind.c1.p20"><s sid="65" id="wind.c1.s65">The voice laughed.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wind.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="wind.c1.s66"><qs/>"The law would have some trouble to catch me!"<qe/> it said.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="wind.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="wind.c1.s67"><qs/>"But if it's not right, you know,"<qe/><sss/> said Diamond, <sse/><qs/>"that's no matter.</s> <s sid="68" id="wind.c1.s68">You shouldn't do it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="wind.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="wind.c1.s69"><qs/>"I am so tall I am above that law,"<qe/> said the voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="wind.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="wind.c1.s70"><qs/>"You must have a tall house, then,"<qe/> said Diamond.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="wind.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="wind.c1.s71"><qs/>"Yes; a tall house: the clouds are inside it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wind.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="wind.c1.s72"><qs/>"Dear me!"<qe/> said Diamond, and thought a minute.</s> <s sid="73" id="wind.c1.s73"><qs/>"I think, then, you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you.</s> <s sid="74" id="wind.c1.s74">Why don't you make a window into Mr. Dyves's bed?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="wind.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="wind.c1.s75"><qs/>"Nobody makes a window into an ash-pit,"<qe/> said the voice, rather sadly.</s> <s sid="76" id="wind.c1.s76"><qs/>"I like to see nice things out of my windows."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="wind.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="wind.c1.s94"><qs/>"Well, I can pull the clothes over my head,"<qe/> said Diamond, and feeling with his little sharp nails, he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="wind.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="wind.c1.s102"><qs/>"It's a very nice name,"<qe/> returned its owner.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER III. OLD DIAMOND</title>
<p pid="1" id="wind.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c3.s1">DIAMOND woke very early in the morning, and thought what a curious dream he had had.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c3.s2">But the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head, until it did not look altogether like a dream, and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c3.s3">He came to the conclusion that, if he had really been brought home to his mother by Mrs. Crump, she would say something to him about it, and that would settle the matter.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c3.s4">Then he got up and dressed himself, but, finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring, he went down the ladder to the stable.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c3.s5">There he found that even old Diamond was not awake yet, for he, as well as young Diamond, always got up the moment he woke, and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="wind.c3.s6"><qs/>"I'll give old Diamond a surprise,"<qe/> thought the boy; and creeping up very softly, before the horse knew, he was astride of his back.</s> <s sid="7" id="wind.c3.s7">Then it was young Diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected; for as with an earthquake, with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither, a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs, young Diamond found himself hoisted up in the air, with both hands twisted in the horse's mane.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c3.s8">The next instant old Diamond lashed out with both his hind legs, and giving one cry of terror young Diamond found himself lying on his neck, with his arms as far round it as they would go.</s> <s sid="9" id="wind.c3.s9">But then the horse stood as still as a stone, except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back.</s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c3.s10">For when he heard young Diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about; for young Diamond was a good boy, and old Diamond was a good horse, and the one was all right on the back of the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wind.c3.p3"><s sid="11" id="wind.c3.s11">As soon as Diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place, the horse began pulling at the hay, and the boy began thinking.</s> <s sid="12" id="wind.c3.s12">He had never mounted Diamond himself before, and he had never got off him without being lifted down.</s> <s sid="13" id="wind.c3.s13">So he sat, while the horse ate, wondering how he was to reach the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wind.c3.p16"><s sid="34" id="wind.c3.s34">For a week his mother watched him very carefully--going into the loft several times a night--as often, in fact, as she woke.</s> <s sid="35" id="wind.c3.s35">Every time she found him fast asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wind.c3.p17"><s sid="36" id="wind.c3.s36">All that week it was hard weather.</s> <s sid="37" id="wind.c3.s37">The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade.</s> <s sid="38" id="wind.c3.s38">And as Diamond's shoes were not good, and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him, she would not let him run out.</s> <s sid="39" id="wind.c3.s39">He played all his games over and over indoors, especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle; and if they did not go very fast, they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world, although one of them had only three legs, and the other only half a back.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wind.c3.p18"><s sid="40" id="wind.c3.s40">At length his mother brought home his new shoes, and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wind.c3.p20"><s sid="46" id="wind.c3.s46">As he was looking at the lovely colours, the gates were thrown open, and there was old Diamond and his friend in the carriage, dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats.</s> <s sid="47" id="wind.c3.s47">And in they came.</s> <s sid="48" id="wind.c3.s48">Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him, but, careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape, with a red edge to every fold, he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables.</s> <s sid="49" id="wind.c3.s49">To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wind.c3.p21"><s sid="50" id="wind.c3.s50">As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream.</s> <s sid="51" id="wind.c3.s51">And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream.</s> <s sid="52" id="wind.c3.s52">At all events, he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then.</s> <s sid="53" id="wind.c3.s53">He opened the door, and passed through the little belt of shrubbery.</s> <s sid="54" id="wind.c3.s54">Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn.</s> <s sid="55" id="wind.c3.s55">Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost.</s> <s sid="56" id="wind.c3.s56">What?</s> <s sid="57" id="wind.c3.s57">Yes!</s> <s sid="58" id="wind.c3.s58">There was one!</s> <s sid="59" id="wind.c3.s59">He ran and knelt down to look at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="wind.c3.p23" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="wind.c3.s66"><qs/>"Miss is very poorly,"<qe/> said Diamond's father.</s> <s sid="67" id="wind.c3.s67"><qs/>"Mis'ess has been to the doctor with her to-day, and she looked very glum when she came out again.</s> <s sid="68" id="wind.c3.s68">I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wind.c3.p26"><s sid="72" id="wind.c3.s72">But he lowered his voice, and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there.</s> <s sid="73" id="wind.c3.s73">For Diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at, and one of the best of drivers, but one of the most discreet of servants as well.</s> <s sid="74" id="wind.c3.s74">Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife, whom he had proved better than himself long ago, and was careful that even Diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="wind.c3.p27"><s sid="75" id="wind.c3.s75">It was bed-time soon, and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="wind.c3.p28"><s sid="76" id="wind.c3.s76">He awoke all at once, in the dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="wind.c16.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c16.s1">THE wind blew loud, but Diamond slept a deep sleep, and never heard it.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c16.s2">My own impression is that every time when Diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning, he had been all that night at the back of the north wind.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c16.s3">I am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed, and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c16.s4">Indeed he said this much, though not to me--that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind, he could not tell what--could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance, or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c16.s5">Sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows--over the shallows, you, know; but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard--how can I tell?</s> <s sid="6" id="wind.c16.s6">I don't know what I know, I only know what I think; and to tell the truth, I am more for the swallows than the sparrows.</s> <s sid="7" id="wind.c16.s7">When he knew he was coming awake, he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song, one he had not heard before--a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one; but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind, ever as he came awaker--as he would say--one line faded away out of it, and then another, and then another, till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies, or something else very common, but with all the commonness polished off it, and the lovely soul of it, which people so seldom see, and, alas! yet seldomer believe in, shining out.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c16.s8">But after that he would sing the oddest, loveliest little songs to the baby--of his own making, his mother said; but Diamond said he did not make them; they were made somewhere inside him, and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c16.p2" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="wind.c16.s9">When he woke that first morning he got up at once, saying to himself, <qs/>"I've been ill long enough, and have given a great deal of trouble; I must try and be of use now, and help my mother."<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c16.s10">When he went into her room he found her lighting the fire, and his father just getting out of bed.</s> <s sid="11" id="wind.c16.s11">They had only the one room, besides the little one, not much more than a closet, in which Diamond slept.</s> <s sid="12" id="wind.c16.s12">He began at once to set things to rights, but the baby waking up, he took him, and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready.</s> <s sid="13" id="wind.c16.s13">She was looking gloomy, and his father was silent; and indeed except Diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows, he too would have grown miserable, and then they would have been all miserable together.</s> <s sid="14" id="wind.c16.s14">But to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves, and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people.</s> <s sid="15" id="wind.c16.s15">For our Selves will always do pretty well if we don't pay them too much attention.</s> <s sid="16" id="wind.c16.s16">Our Selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games, but when we begin to interfere with them, and make them presents of too nice playthings, or too many sweet things, they begin at once to fret and spoil.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wind.c16.p3" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="wind.c16.s17"><qs/>"Why, Diamond, child!"<qe/><sls/> said his mother at last, <sle/><qs/>"you're as good to your mother as if you were a girl--nursing the baby, and toasting the bread, and sweeping up the hearth!</s> <s sid="18" id="wind.c16.s18">I declare a body would think you had been among the fairies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wind.c16.p4"><s sid="19" id="wind.c16.s19">Could Diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure?</s> <s sid="20" id="wind.c16.s20">You see when he forgot his Self his mother took care of his Self, and loved and praised his Self.</s> <s sid="21" id="wind.c16.s21">Our own praises poison our Selves, and puff and swell them up, till they lose all shape and beauty, and become like great toadstools.</s> <s sid="22" id="wind.c16.s22">But the praises of father or mother do our Selves good, and comfort them and make them beautiful.</s> <s sid="23" id="wind.c16.s23">They never do them any harm.</s> <s sid="24" id="wind.c16.s24">If they do any harm, it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them, and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wind.c16.p5"><s sid="25" id="wind.c16.s25">When his father had finished his breakfast, which he did rather in a hurry, he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wind.c16.p6" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="wind.c16.s26"><qs/>"Won't you come and see the cab, Diamond?"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wind.c16.p7" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="wind.c16.s27"><qs/>"Yes, please, father--if mother can spare me a minute,"<qe/> answered Diamond.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wind.c16.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="wind.c16.s28"><qs/>"Bless the child!</s> <s sid="29" id="wind.c16.s29">I don't want him,"<qe/> said his mother cheerfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wind.c16.p9"><s sid="30" id="wind.c16.s30">But as he was following his father out of the door, she called him back.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wind.c16.p10" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="wind.c16.s31"><qs/>"Diamond, just hold the baby one minute.</s> <s sid="32" id="wind.c16.s32">I have something to say to your father."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wind.c16.p11"><s sid="33" id="wind.c16.s33">So Diamond sat down again, took the baby in his lap, and began poking his face into its little body, laughing and singing all the while, so that the baby crowed like a little bantam.</s> <s sid="34" id="wind.c16.s34">And what he sang was something like this--such nonsense to those that couldn't understand it! but not to the baby, who got all the good in the world out of it:-- baby's a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby's the bonniest and baby's the funniest and baby's the shiniest and baby's the tiniest and baby's the merriest and baby's the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother's the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father's the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that's baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby and baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wind.c16.p12"><s sid="35" id="wind.c16.s35">Here Diamond's knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals.</s> <s sid="36" id="wind.c16.s36">His mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song, and came in with the tears in her eyes.</s> <s sid="37" id="wind.c16.s37">She took the baby from him, gave him a kiss, and told him to run to his father.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wind.c16.p13"><s sid="38" id="wind.c16.s38">By the time Diamond got into the yard, the horse was between the shafts, and his father was looping the traces on.</s> <s sid="39" id="wind.c16.s39">Diamond went round to look at the horse.</s> <s sid="40" id="wind.c16.s40">The sight of him made him feel very queer.</s> <s sid="41" id="wind.c16.s41">He did not know much about different horses, and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him.</s> <s sid="42" id="wind.c16.s42">But he could not make it out.</s> <s sid="43" id="wind.c16.s43">This was Diamond and it wasn't Diamond.</s> <s sid="44" id="wind.c16.s44">Diamond didn't hang his head like that; yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that Diamond used to hold so high.</s> <s sid="45" id="wind.c16.s45">Diamond's bones didn't show through his skin like that; but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like Diamond's skin; and the bones might be Diamond's bones, for he had never seen the shape of them.</s> <s sid="46" id="wind.c16.s46">But when he came round in front of the old horse, and he put out his long neck, and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him, then Diamond saw it could be no other than old Diamond, and he did just as his father had done before--put his arms round his neck and cried--but not much.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wind.c16.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="wind.c16.s47"><qs/>"Ain't it jolly, father?"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="48" id="wind.c16.s48"><qs/>"Was there ever anybody so lucky as me?</s> <s sid="49" id="wind.c16.s49">Dear old Diamond!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wind.c16.p15"><s sid="50" id="wind.c16.s50">And he hugged the horse again, and kissed both his big hairy cheeks.</s> <s sid="51" id="wind.c16.s51">He could only manage one at a time, however--the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wind.c16.p16" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="wind.c16.s52">His father mounted the box with just the same air, as Diamond thought, with which he had used to get upon the coach-box, and Diamond said to himself, <qs/>"Father's as grand as ever anyhow."<qe/></s> <s sid="53" id="wind.c16.s53">He had kept his brown livery-coat, only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead, because they did not think it polite to Mr. Coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab.</s> <s sid="54" id="wind.c16.s54">Old Diamond had kept just his collar; and that had the silver crest upon it still, for his master thought nobody would notice that, and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him--not unpleasantly, seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse's that they had come down in the world together.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wind.c16.p17" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="wind.c16.s55"><qs/>"Oh, father, do let me drive a bit,"<qe/> said Diamond, jumping up on the box beside him.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wind.c16.p18"><s sid="56" id="wind.c16.s56">His father changed places with him at once, putting the reins into his hands.</s> <s sid="57" id="wind.c16.s57">Diamond gathered them up eagerly.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="wind.c16.p19" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="wind.c16.s58"><qs/>"Don't pull at his mouth,"<qe/><sss/> said his father, <sse/><qs/>"just feel, at it gently to let him know you're there and attending to him.</s> <s sid="59" id="wind.c16.s59">That's what I call talking to him through the reins."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wind.c16.p20" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="wind.c16.s60"><qs/>"Yes, father, I understand,"<qe/> said Diamond.</s> <s sid="61" id="wind.c16.s61">Then to the horse he said, <qs/>"Go on Diamond."<qe/></s> <s sid="62" id="wind.c16.s62">And old Diamond's ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wind.c16.p21" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="wind.c16.s63">But before they had reached the entrance of the mews, another voice called after young Diamond, which, in his turn, he had to obey, for it was that of his mother.</s> <s sid="64" id="wind.c16.s64"><qs/>"Diamond!</s> <s sid="65" id="wind.c16.s65">Diamond!"<qe/> it cried; and Diamond pulled the reins, and the horse stood still as a stone.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="wind.c16.p22" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="wind.c16.s66"><qs/>"Husband,"<qe/><sls/> said his mother, coming up, <sle/><qs/>"you're never going to trust him with the reins--a baby like that?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="wind.c16.p24" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="wind.c16.s73"><qs/>"Well, but, husband, I can't do without him to-day.</s> <s sid="74" id="wind.c16.s74">Everything's got to be done, you know.</s> <s sid="75" id="wind.c16.s75">It's my first day here.</s> <s sid="76" id="wind.c16.s76">And there's that baby!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wind.c16.p26" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="wind.c16.s80"><qs/>"No thank you, father; not to-day,"<qe/> said Diamond.</s> <s sid="81" id="wind.c16.s81"><qs/>"Mother wants me.</s> <s sid="82" id="wind.c16.s82">Perhaps she'll let me go another day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="wind.c16.p27" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="wind.c16.s83"><qs/>"Very well, my man,"<qe/> said his father, and took the reins which Diamond was holding out to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="wind.c16.p28"><s sid="84" id="wind.c16.s84">Diamond got down, a little disappointed of course, and went with his mother, who was too pleased to speak.</s> <s sid="85" id="wind.c16.s85">She only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="wind.c16.p29"><s sid="86" id="wind.c16.s86">Now, although they did not know it, the owner of the stables, the same man who had sold the horse to his father, had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors, with his hands in his pockets, and had heard and seen all that passed; and from that day John Stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy.</s> <s sid="87" id="wind.c16.s87">And this was the beginning of what came of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="wind.c16.p30"><s sid="88" id="wind.c16.s88">The same evening, just as Diamond was feeling tired of the day's work, and wishing his father would come home, Mr. Stonecrop knocked at the door.</s> <s sid="89" id="wind.c16.s89">His mother went and opened it.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="wind.c16.p31" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="wind.c16.s90"><qs/>"Good evening, ma'am,"<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="91" id="wind.c16.s91"><qs/>"Is the little master in?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="wind.c16.p36" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="wind.c16.s100"><qs/>"Oh, well,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Stonecrop, <sse/><qs/>"I can just let him drive through Bloomsbury Square, and then he shall run home again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="wind.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c18.s1">A FEW nights after this, Diamond woke up suddenly, believing he heard North Wind thundering along.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c18.s2">But it was something quite different.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c18.s3">South Wind was moaning round the chimneys, to be sure, for she was not very happy that night, but it was not her voice that had wakened Diamond.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c18.s4">Her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c18.s5">It was a loud, angry voice, now growling like that of a beast, now raving like that of a madman; and when Diamond came a little wider awake, he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman, the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed.</s> <s sid="6" id="wind.c18.s6">It was anything but pleasant to hear, but he could not help hearing it.</s> <s sid="7" id="wind.c18.s7">At length there came a cry from the woman, and then a scream from the baby.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c18.s8">Thereupon Diamond thought it time that somebody did something, and as himself was the only somebody at hand, he must go and see whether he could not do something.</s> <s sid="9" id="wind.c18.s9">So he got up and put on part of his clothes, and went down the stair, for the cabman's room did not open upon their stair, and he had to go out into the yard, and in at the next door.</s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c18.s10">This, fortunately, the cabman, being drunk, had left open.</s> <s sid="11" id="wind.c18.s11">By the time he reached their stair, all was still except the voice of the crying baby, which guided him to the right door.</s> <s sid="12" id="wind.c18.s12">He opened it softly, and peeped in.</s> <s sid="13" id="wind.c18.s13">There, leaning back in a chair, with his arms hanging down by his sides, and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels, sat the drunken cabman.</s> <s sid="14" id="wind.c18.s14">His wife lay in her clothes upon the bed, sobbing, and the baby was wailing in the cradle.</s> <s sid="15" id="wind.c18.s15">It was very miserable altogether.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c18.p2"><s sid="16" id="wind.c18.s16">Now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight, and try to forget it.</s> <s sid="17" id="wind.c18.s17">But Diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery.</s> <s sid="18" id="wind.c18.s18">The little boy was just as much one of God's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword, going out to fight the devil.</s> <s sid="19" id="wind.c18.s19">The devil he had to fight just then was Misery.</s> <s sid="20" id="wind.c18.s20">And the way he fought him was the very best.</s> <s sid="21" id="wind.c18.s21">Like a wise soldier, he attacked him first in his weakest point--that was the baby; for Misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person.</s> <s sid="22" id="wind.c18.s22">Diamond was knowing in babies, and he knew he could do something to make the baby, happy; for although he had only known one baby as yet, and although not one baby is the same as another, yet they are so very much alike in some things, and he knew that one baby so thoroughly, that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other.</s> <s sid="23" id="wind.c18.s23">I have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way.</s> <s sid="24" id="wind.c18.s24">They would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman; and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his, and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read, which they were sure to hate the sight of; while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby.</s> <s sid="25" id="wind.c18.s25">But Diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment, set him up on his knee, and told him to look at the light.</s> <s sid="26" id="wind.c18.s26">Now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard, and it was a very dingy and yellow light, for the glass of the lamp was dirty, and the gas was bad; but the light that came from it was, notwithstanding, as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself, and the baby knew that, and smiled to it; and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted--so dreary, and dirty, and empty, and hopeless!--there in the middle of it sat Diamond on a stool, smiling to the baby, and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp.</s> <s sid="27" id="wind.c18.s27">The father of him sat staring at nothing, neither asleep nor awake, not quite lost in stupidity either, for through it all he was dimly angry with himself, he did not know why.</s> <s sid="28" id="wind.c18.s28">It was that he had struck his wife.</s> <s sid="29" id="wind.c18.s29">He had forgotten it, but was miserable about it, notwithstanding.</s> <s sid="30" id="wind.c18.s30">And this misery was the voice of the great Love that had made him and his wife and the baby and Diamond, speaking in his heart, and telling him to be good.</s> <s sid="31" id="wind.c18.s31">For that great Love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts; only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds.</s> <s sid="32" id="wind.c18.s32">On Mount Sinai, it was thunder; in the cabman's heart it was misery; in the soul of St.</s> <s sid="33" id="wind.c18.s33">John it was perfect blessedness.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wind.c18.p3"><s sid="34" id="wind.c18.s34">By and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room.</s> <s sid="35" id="wind.c18.s35">This, of course, was the voice of Diamond singing to the baby--song after song, every one as foolish as another to the cabman, for he was too tipsy to part one word from another: all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop; for such was the way he spoke himself, when he was in this horrid condition.</s> <s sid="36" id="wind.c18.s36">But the baby was more than content with Diamond's songs, and Diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about, that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves, if only baby liked them.</s> <s sid="37" id="wind.c18.s37">But they did the cabman good as well as the baby and Diamond, for they put him to sleep, and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted, smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wind.c18.p4"><s sid="38" id="wind.c18.s38">At length Diamond grew tired of singing, and began to talk to the baby instead.</s> <s sid="39" id="wind.c18.s39">And as soon as he stopped singing, the cabman began to wake up.</s> <s sid="40" id="wind.c18.s40">His brain was a little clearer now, his temper a little smoother, and his heart not quite so dirty.</s> <s sid="41" id="wind.c18.s41">He began to listen and he went on listening, and heard Diamond saying to the baby something like this, for he thought the cabman was asleep:</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wind.c18.p6"><s sid="60" id="wind.c18.s60">He went on with chatter like this till baby was asleep, by which time he was tired, and father and mother were both wide awake--only rather confused--the one from the beer, the other from the blow--and staring, the one from his chair, the other from her bed, at Diamond.</s> <s sid="61" id="wind.c18.s61">But he was quite unaware of their notice, for he sat half-asleep, with his eyes wide open, staring in his turn, though without knowing it, at the cabman, while the cabman could not withdraw his gaze from Diamond's white face and big eyes.</s> <s sid="62" id="wind.c18.s62">For Diamond's face was always rather pale, and now it was paler than usual with sleeplessness, and the light of the street-lamp upon it.</s> <s sid="63" id="wind.c18.s63">At length he found himself nodding, and he knew then it was time to put the baby down, lest he should let him fall.</s> <s sid="64" id="wind.c18.s64">So he rose from the little three-legged stool, and laid the baby in the cradle, and covered him up--it was well it was a warm night, and he did not want much covering--and then he all but staggered out of the door, he was so tipsy himself with sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="wind.c19.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c19.s1">ONE day when old Diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between Pall Mall and Cockspur Street, and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab, which was the last of a good many in the row, little Diamond got down for a run, for his legs were getting cramped with sitting.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c19.s2">And first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing, where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c19.s3">Just as he was going to speak to her, a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c19.s4">He was pleased to find it so clean, for the streets were muddy, and he had nice boots on; so he put his hand in his pocket, and gave the girl a penny.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c19.s5">But when she gave him a sweet smile in return, and made him a pretty courtesy, he looked at her again, and said:</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="wind.c31.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c31.s1">IT WAS a great delight to Diamond when at length Nanny was well enough to leave the hospital and go home to their house.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c31.s2">She was not very strong yet, but Diamond's mother was very considerate of her, and took care that she should have nothing to do she was not quite fit for.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c31.s3">If Nanny had been taken straight from the street, it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household, or so easy to teach; but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital, she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c31.s4">As she got better, and the colour came back to her cheeks, her step grew lighter and quicker, her smile shone out more readily, and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c31.s5">It was great fun to see Diamond teaching her how to hold the baby, and wash and dress him, and often they laughed together over her awkwardness.</s> <s sid="6" id="wind.c31.s6">But she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as Diamond himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c31.p2"><s sid="7" id="wind.c31.s7">Things however did not go well with Joseph from the very arrival of Ruby.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c31.s8">It almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him.</s> <s sid="9" id="wind.c31.s9">The fares were fewer, and the pay less.</s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c31.s10">Ruby's services did indeed make the week's income at first a little beyond what it used to be, but then there were two more to feed.</s> <s sid="11" id="wind.c31.s11">After the first month he fell lame, and for the whole of the next Joseph dared not attempt to work him.</s> <s sid="12" id="wind.c31.s12">I cannot say that he never grumbled, for his own health was far from what it had been; but I can say that he tried to do his best.</s> <s sid="13" id="wind.c31.s13">During all that month, they lived on very short commons indeed, seldom tasting meat except on Sundays, and poor old Diamond, who worked hardest of all, not even then--so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse, while Ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop's cob.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wind.c31.p3"><s sid="14" id="wind.c31.s14">Nor was it much better after Ruby was able to work again, for it was a season of great depression in business, and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen.</s> <s sid="15" id="wind.c31.s15">City men look more after their shillings, and their wives and daughters have less to spend.</s> <s sid="16" id="wind.c31.s16">It was besides a wet autumn, and bread rose greatly in price.</s> <s sid="17" id="wind.c31.s17">When I add to this that Diamond's mother was but poorly, for a new baby was coming, you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wind.c31.p4"><s sid="18" id="wind.c31.s18">Notwithstanding the depressing influences around him, Joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart; and when he came home at night, would get Diamond to read to him, and would also make Nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on.</s> <s sid="19" id="wind.c31.s19">For Diamond had taken her education in hand, and as she was a clever child, she was very soon able to put letters and words together.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wind.c31.p5"><s sid="20" id="wind.c31.s20">Thus the three months passed away, but Mr. Raymond did not return.</s> <s sid="21" id="wind.c31.s21">Joseph had been looking anxiously for him, chiefly with the desire of getting rid of Ruby--not that he was absolutely of no use to him, but that he was a constant weight upon his mind.</s> <s sid="22" id="wind.c31.s22">Indeed, as far as provision went, he was rather worse off with Ruby and Nanny than he had been before, but on the other hand, Nanny was a great help in the house, and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come, Nanny would be with his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wind.c31.p6"><s sid="23" id="wind.c31.s23">Of God's gifts a baby is of the greatest; therefore it is no wonder that when this one came, she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her.</s> <s sid="24" id="wind.c31.s24">Of course she made a great difference in the work to be done--far more difference than her size warranted, but Nanny was no end of help, and Diamond was as much of a sunbeam as ever, and began to sing to the new baby the first moment he got her in his arms.</s> <s sid="25" id="wind.c31.s25">But he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother, for, he said, she was a new baby and must have new songs; and besides, she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby, and of course would not like the same kind of songs.</s> <s sid="26" id="wind.c31.s26">Where the difference in his songs lay, however, I do not pretend to be able to point out.</s> <s sid="27" id="wind.c31.s27">One thing I am sure of, that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl, but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wind.c31.p7"><s sid="28" id="wind.c31.s28">How they managed to get through the long dreary expensive winter, I can hardly say.</s> <s sid="29" id="wind.c31.s29">Sometimes things were better, sometimes worse.</s> <s sid="30" id="wind.c31.s30">But at last the spring came, and the winter was over and gone, and that was much.</s> <s sid="31" id="wind.c31.s31">Still, Mr. Raymond did not return, and although the mother would have been able to manage without Nanny now, they could not look for a place for her so long as they had Ruby; and they were not altogether sorry for this.</s> <s sid="32" id="wind.c31.s32">One week at last was worse than they had yet had.</s> <s sid="33" id="wind.c31.s33">They were almost without bread before it was over.</s> <s sid="34" id="wind.c31.s34">But the sadder he saw his father and mother looking, the more Diamond set himself to sing to the two babies.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wind.c31.p8"><s sid="35" id="wind.c31.s35">One thing which had increased their expenses was that they had been forced to hire another little room for Nanny.</s> <s sid="36" id="wind.c31.s36">When the second baby came, Diamond gave up his room that Nanny might be at hand to help his mother, and went to hers, which, although a fine place to what she had been accustomed to, was not very nice in his eyes.</s> <s sid="37" id="wind.c31.s37">He did not mind the change though, for was not his mother the more comfortable for it?</s> <s sid="38" id="wind.c31.s38">And was not Nanny more comfortable too?</s> <s sid="39" id="wind.c31.s39">And indeed was not Diamond himself more comfortable that other people were more comfortable?</s> <s sid="40" id="wind.c31.s40">And if there was more comfort every way, the change was a happy one.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="wind.c34.p38"><s sid="68" id="wind.c34.s68">Diamond succeeded in bringing Jim to Mr. Raymond, and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance.</s> <s sid="69" id="wind.c34.s69">He provided new clothes for both him and Nanny; and upon a certain day, Joseph took his wife and three children, and Nanny and Jim, by train to a certain station in the county of Kent, where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to The Mound, which was the name of Mr. Raymond's new residence.</s> <s sid="70" id="wind.c34.s70">I will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went, or when they arrived.</s> <s sid="71" id="wind.c34.s71">All I will say is, that Diamond, who is my only care, was full of quiet delight--a gladness too deep to talk about.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="wind.c34.p39"><s sid="72" id="wind.c34.s72">Joseph returned to town the same night, and the next morning drove Ruby and Diamond down, with the carriage behind them, and Mr. Raymond and a lady in the carriage.</s> <s sid="73" id="wind.c34.s73">For Mr. Raymond was an old bachelor no longer: he was bringing his wife with him to live at The Mound.</s> <s sid="74" id="wind.c34.s74">The moment Nanny saw her, she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring.</s> <s sid="75" id="wind.c34.s75">That ring had been given her by Mr. Raymond.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="wind.c34.p40"><s sid="76" id="wind.c34.s76">The weather was very hot, and the woods very shadowy.</s> <s sid="77" id="wind.c34.s77">There were not a great many wild flowers, for it was getting well towards autumn, and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves, because if they did not, they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them.</s> <s sid="78" id="wind.c34.s78">So they have their fun over, and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed.</s> <s sid="79" id="wind.c34.s79">But there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house, and Diamond's chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them, and breathe the pure air.</s> <s sid="80" id="wind.c34.s80">But all the time, he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind, and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing.</s> <s sid="81" id="wind.c34.s81">For this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it.</s> <s sid="82" id="wind.c34.s82">Sometimes he would have his little brother, sometimes his little sister, and sometimes both of them in the grass with him, and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens, he said, only he couldn't purr--all he could do was to sing.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="wind.c34.p41"><s sid="83" id="wind.c34.s83">These were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab, but you must not suppose that Diamond was idle.</s> <s sid="84" id="wind.c34.s84">He did not do so much for his mother now, because Nanny occupied his former place; but he helped his father still, both in the stable and the harness-room, and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair, and be ready to open the carriage-door.</s> <s sid="85" id="wind.c34.s85">Mr. Raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="wind.c34.p42" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="wind.c34.s86"><qs/>"A boy like that,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"ought not to be pushed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="wind.c34.p43"><s sid="87" id="wind.c34.s87">Joseph assented heartily, smiling to himself at the idea of pushing Diamond.</s> <s sid="88" id="wind.c34.s88">After doing everything that fell to his share, the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal.</s> <s sid="89" id="wind.c34.s89">And a happy, sometimes a merry time it was.</s> <s sid="90" id="wind.c34.s90">Only for two months or so, he neither saw nor heard anything of North Wind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="wind.c35.p1"><s sid="1" id="wind.c35.s1">MR.</s> <s sid="2" id="wind.c35.s2">RAYMOND'S house was called The Mound, because it stood upon a little steep knoll, so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial.</s> <s sid="3" id="wind.c35.s3">It had, beyond doubt, been built for Queen Elizabeth as a hunting tower--a place, namely, from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides, and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen.</s> <s sid="4" id="wind.c35.s4">The mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods.</s> <s sid="5" id="wind.c35.s5">There was a great quarry-hole not far off, brim-full of water, from which, as the current legend stated, the materials forming the heart of the mound--a kind of stone unfit for building--had been dug.</s> <s sid="6" id="wind.c35.s6">The house itself was of brick, and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level, and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them, so that its great height should be well buttressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wind.c35.p2"><s sid="7" id="wind.c35.s7">Joseph and his wife lived in a little cottage a short way from the house.</s> <s sid="8" id="wind.c35.s8">It was a real cottage, with a roof of thick thatch, which, in June and July, the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls.</s> <s sid="9" id="wind.c35.s9">At first Diamond had a nest under this thatch--a pretty little room with white muslin curtains, but afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Raymond wanted to have him for a page in the house, and his father and mother were quite pleased to have him employed without his leaving them.</s> <s sid="10" id="wind.c35.s10">So he was dressed in a suit of blue, from which his pale face and fair hair came out like the loveliest blossom, and took up his abode in the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wind.c35.p8"><s sid="18" id="wind.c35.s18">Near the top they entered a tiny little room, with two windows from which you could see over the whole country.</s> <s sid="19" id="wind.c35.s19">Diamond clapped his hands with delight.</s> </p>
