<title>CHAPTER 1. ALL THE PROCTORS BUT PHIL.</title>
<p pid="1" id="crofton.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="crofton.c1.s1">Mr Proctor, the chemist and druggist, kept his shop, and lived in the Strand, London.</s> <s sid="2" id="crofton.c1.s2">His children thought that there was never anything pleasanter than the way they lived.</s> <s sid="3" id="crofton.c1.s3">Their house was warm in winter, and such a little distance from the church, that they had no difficulty in getting to church and back again, in the worst weather, before their shoes were wet.</s> <s sid="4" id="crofton.c1.s4">They were also conveniently near to Covent Garden market; so that, if any friend dropped in to dinner unexpectedly, Jane and Agnes could be off to the market, and buy a fowl, or some vegetables or fruit, and be back again before they were missed.</s> <s sid="5" id="crofton.c1.s5">It was not even too far for little Harry to trot with one of his sisters, early on a summer's morning, to spend his penny (when he happened to have one) on a bunch of flowers, to lay on papa's plate, to surprise him when he came in to breakfast.</s> <s sid="6" id="crofton.c1.s6">Not much farther off was the Temple Garden, where Mrs Proctor took her children every fine summer evening to walk and breathe the air from the river; and when Mr Proctor could find time to come to them for a turn or two before the younger ones must go home to bed, it seemed to the whole party the happiest and most beautiful place in the whole world,--except one.</s> <s sid="7" id="crofton.c1.s7">They had once been to Broadstairs, when the children were in poor health after the measles: and for ever after, when they thought of the waves beating on the shore, and of the pleasures of growing strong and well among the sea-breezes, they felt that there might be places more delightful than the Temple Garden: but they were still very proud and fond of the grass and trees, and the gravel walks, and the view over the Thames, and were pleased to show off the garden to all friends from the country who came to visit them.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="crofton.c1.p2"><s sid="8" id="crofton.c1.s8">The greatest privilege of all, however, was that they could see the river without going out of their own house.</s> <s sid="9" id="crofton.c1.s9">There were three back windows to the house, one above another; and from the two uppermost of these windows there was what the children called a view of the Thames.</s> <s sid="10" id="crofton.c1.s10">There was a gap of a few yards wide between two high brick houses: and through this gap might be seen the broad river, with vessels of every kind passing up or down.</s> <s sid="11" id="crofton.c1.s11">Outside the second window were some leads, affording space for three or four chairs: and here it was that Jane and Agnes liked to sit at work, on certain hours of fine days.</s> <s sid="12" id="crofton.c1.s12">There were times when these leads were too hot, the heat of the sun being reflected from the surrounding brick walls; but at an earlier hour before the shadows were gone, and when the air blew in from the river, the place was cool, and the little girls delighted to carry their stools to the leads, and do their sewing there.</s> <s sid="13" id="crofton.c1.s13">There Philip would condescend to spend a part of his mornings, in his Midsummer holidays, frightening his sisters with climbing about in dangerous places, or amusing them with stories of school pranks, or raising his younger brother Hugh's envy of the boys who were so happy as to be old enough to go to school at Mr Tooke's, at Crofton.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="crofton.c1.p3"><s sid="14" id="crofton.c1.s14">The girls had no peace from their brothers climbing about in dangerous places.</s> <s sid="15" id="crofton.c1.s15">Hugh was, if possible, worse than Philip for this.</s> <s sid="16" id="crofton.c1.s16">He imitated all Philip's feats, and had some of his own besides.</s> <s sid="17" id="crofton.c1.s17">In answer to Jane's lectures and the entreaties of Agnes, Hugh always declared that he had a right to do such things, as he meant to be a soldier or a sailor; and how should he be able to climb the mast of a ship, or the walls of a city, if he did not begin to practise now?</s> <s sid="18" id="crofton.c1.s18">Agnes was almost sorry they had been to Broadstairs, and could see ships in the Thames, when she considered that, if Hugh had not seen so much of the world, he might have been satisfied to be apprenticed to his father, when old enough, and to have lived at home happily with his family.</s> <s sid="19" id="crofton.c1.s19">Jane advised Agnes not to argue with Hugh, and then perhaps his wish to rove about the world might go off.</s> <s sid="20" id="crofton.c1.s20">She had heard her father say that, when he was a boy, and used to bring home news of victories, and help to put up candles at the windows on illumination nights, he had a great fancy for being a soldier; but that it was his fortune to see some soldiers from Spain, and hear from them what war really was, just when peace came, and when there was no more glory to be got; so that he had happily settled down to be a London shop-keeper--a lot which he would not exchange with that of any man living.</s> <s sid="21" id="crofton.c1.s21">Hugh was very like papa, Jane added; and the same change might take place in his mind, if he was not made perverse by argument.</s> <s sid="22" id="crofton.c1.s22">So Agnes only sighed, and bent her head closer over her work, as she heard Hugh talk of the adventures he meant to have when he should be old enough to get away from Old England.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="crofton.c1.p4"><s sid="23" id="crofton.c1.s23">There was one person that laughed at Hugh for this fancy of his;--Miss Harold, the daily governess, who came to keep school for three hours every morning.</s> <s sid="24" id="crofton.c1.s24">When Hugh forgot his lesson, and sat staring at the upper panes of the window, in a reverie about his future travels; or when he was found to have been drawing a soldier on his slate instead of doing his sum, Miss Harold reminded him what a pretty figure a soldier would cut who knew no geography, or a sailor who could not make his reckonings, for want of attending early to his arithmetic Hugh could not deny this; but he was always wishing that school-hours were over, that he might get under the great dining table to read Robinson Crusoe, or might play at shipwreck, under pretence of amusing little Harry.</s> <s sid="25" id="crofton.c1.s25">It did make him ashamed to see how his sisters got on, from the mere pleasure of learning, and without any idea of ever living anywhere but in London; while he, who seemed to have so much more reason for wanting the very knowledge that they were obtaining, could not settle his mind to his lessons.</s> <s sid="26" id="crofton.c1.s26">Jane was beginning to read French books for her amusement in leisure hours; and Agnes was often found to have covered two slates with sums in Practice, just for pleasure, while he could not master the very moderate lessons Miss Harold set him.</s> <s sid="27" id="crofton.c1.s27">It is true, he was two years younger than Agnes: but she had known more of everything that he had learned, at seven years old, than he now did at eight.</s> <s sid="28" id="crofton.c1.s28">Hugh began to feel very unhappy.</s> <s sid="29" id="crofton.c1.s29">He saw that Miss Harold was dissatisfied, and was pretty sure that she had spoken to his mother about him.</s> <s sid="30" id="crofton.c1.s30">He felt that his mother became more strict in making him sit down beside her, in the afternoon, to learn his lessons for the next day; and he was pretty sure that Agnes went out of the room because she could not help crying when his sum was found to be all wrong, or when he mistook his tenses, or when he said (as he did every day, though regularly warned to mind what he was about) that four times seven is fifty-six.</s> <s sid="31" id="crofton.c1.s31">Every day these things weighed more on Hugh's spirits; every day he felt more and more like a dunce; and when Philip came home for the Midsummer holidays, and told all manner of stories about all sorts of boys at school, without describing anything like Hugh's troubles with Miss Harold, Hugh was seized with a longing to go to Crofton at once, as he was certainly too young to go at present into the way of a shipwreck or a battle.</s> <s sid="32" id="crofton.c1.s32">The worst of it was, there was no prospect of his going yet to Crofton.</s> <s sid="33" id="crofton.c1.s33">In Mr Tooke's large school there was not one boy younger than ten; and Philip believed that Mr Tooke did not like to take little boys.</s> <s sid="34" id="crofton.c1.s34">Hugh was aware that his father and mother meant to send him to school with Philip by-and-by; but the idea of having to wait--to do his lessons with Miss Harold every day till he should be ten years old, made him roll himself on the parlour carpet in despair.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="crofton.c1.p5"><s sid="35" id="crofton.c1.s35">Philip was between eleven and twelve.</s> <s sid="36" id="crofton.c1.s36">He was happy at school: and he liked to talk all about it at home.</s> <s sid="37" id="crofton.c1.s37">These holidays, Hugh made a better listener than even his sisters; and he was a more amusing one--he knew so little about the country.</s> <s sid="38" id="crofton.c1.s38">He asked every question that could be imagined about the playground at the Crofton school, and the boys' doings out of school; and then, when Philip fancied he must know all about what was done, out came some odd remark which showed what wrong notions he had formed of a country life.</s> <s sid="39" id="crofton.c1.s39">Hugh had not learned half that he wanted to know, and his little head was full of wonder and mysterious notions, when the holidays came to an end, and Philip had to go away.</s> <s sid="40" id="crofton.c1.s40">From that day Hugh was heard to talk less of Spain, and the sea, and desert islands, and more of the Crofton boys; and his play with little Harry was all of being at school.</s> <s sid="41" id="crofton.c1.s41">At his lessons, meantime, he did not improve at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="crofton.c1.p6"><s sid="42" id="crofton.c1.s42">One very warm day, at the end of August, five weeks after Philip had returned to school, Miss Harold had stayed full ten minutes after twelve o'clock to hear Hugh say one line of the multiplication-table over and over again, to cure him of saying that four times seven is fifty-six; but all in vain: and Mrs Proctor had pegged her not to spend any more time to-day upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="crofton.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="crofton.c1.s43">Miss Harold went away, the girls took their sewing, and sat down at their mother's work-table, while Hugh was placed before her, with his hands behind his back, and desired to look his mother full in the face, to begin again with <qs/>"four times one is four,"<qe/> and go through the line, taking care what he was about.</s> <s sid="44" id="crofton.c1.s44">He did so; but before he came to four times seven, he sighed, fidgetted, looked up at the corners of the room, off into the work-basket, out into the street, and always, as if by a spell, finished with <qs/>"four times seven is fifty-six."<qe/></s> <s sid="45" id="crofton.c1.s45">Jane looked up amazed--Agnes looked down ashamed; his mother looked with severity in his face.</s> <s sid="46" id="crofton.c1.s46">He began the line a fourth time, when, at the third figure, he started as if he had been shot.</s> <s sid="47" id="crofton.c1.s47">It was only a knock at the door that he had heard; a treble knock, which startled nobody else, though, from the parlour-door being open, it sounded pretty loud.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="crofton.c1.p8"><s sid="48" id="crofton.c1.s48">Mrs Proctor spread a handkerchief over the stockings in her work-basket; Jane put back a stray curl which had fallen over her face; Agnes lifted up her head with a sigh, as if relieved that the multiplication-table must stop for this time; and Hugh gazed into the passage, through the open door, when he heard a man's step there.</s> <s sid="49" id="crofton.c1.s49">The maid announced Mr Tooke, of Crofton; and Mr Tooke walked in.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="crofton.c1.p9"><s sid="50" id="crofton.c1.s50">Mrs Proctor had actually to push Hugh to one side,--so directly did he stand in the way between her and her visitor.</s> <s sid="51" id="crofton.c1.s51">He stood, with his hands still behind his back, gazing up at Mr Tooke, with his face hotter than the multiplication-table had ever made it, and his eyes staring quite as earnestly as they had ever done to find Robinson Crusoe's island in the map.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="crofton.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="crofton.c1.s52"><qs/>"Go, child,"<qe/> said Mrs Proctor: but this was not enough.</s> <s sid="53" id="crofton.c1.s53">Mr Tooke himself had to pass him under his left arm before he could shake hands with Mrs Proctor.</s> <s sid="54" id="crofton.c1.s54">Hugh was now covered with shame at this hint that he was in the way; but yet he did not leave the room.</s> <s sid="55" id="crofton.c1.s55">He stole to the window, and flung himself down on two chairs, as if looking into the street from behind the blind; but he saw nothing that passed out of doors, so eager was his hope of hearing something of the Crofton boys,-- their trap-ball, and their Saturday walk with the usher.</s> <s sid="56" id="crofton.c1.s56">Not a word of this kind did he hear.</s> <s sid="57" id="crofton.c1.s57">As soon as Mr Tooke had agreed to stay to dinner, his sisters were desired to carry their work elsewhere,--to the leads, if they liked; and he was told that he might go to play.</s> <s sid="58" id="crofton.c1.s58">He had hoped he might be overlooked in the window; and unwillingly did he put down first one leg and then the other from the chairs, and saunter out of the room.</s> <s sid="59" id="crofton.c1.s59">He did not choose to go near his sisters, to be told how stupidly he had stood in the gentleman's way; so, when he saw that they were placing their stools on the leads, he went up into the attic, and then down into the kitchen, to see where little Harry was, to play at schoolboys in the back yard.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="crofton.c1.p11"><s sid="60" id="crofton.c1.s60">The maid Susan was not sorry that Harry was taken off her hands; for she wished to rub up her spoons, and fill her castors afresh, for the sake of the visitor who had come in.</s> <s sid="61" id="crofton.c1.s61">The thoughtful Jane soon came down with the keys to get out a clean tablecloth, and order a dish of cutlets, in addition to the dinner, and consult with Susan about some dessert; so that, as the little boys looked up from their play, they saw Agnes sitting alone at work upon the leads.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="crofton.c1.p12"><s sid="62" id="crofton.c1.s62">They had played some time, Hugh acting a naughty boy who could not say his Latin lesson to the usher, and little Harry punishing him with far more words than a real usher uses on such an occasion, when they heard Agnes calling them from above their heads.</s> <s sid="63" id="crofton.c1.s63">She was leaning over from the leads, begging Hugh to come up to her,--that very moment.</s> <s sid="64" id="crofton.c1.s64">Harry must be left below, as the leads were a forbidden place for him.</s> <s sid="65" id="crofton.c1.s65">So Harry went to Jane, to see her dish up greengage plums which he must not touch: and Hugh ran up the stairs.</s> <s sid="66" id="crofton.c1.s66">As he passed through the passage, his mother called him.</s> <s sid="67" id="crofton.c1.s67">Full of some kind of hope (he did not himself know what), he entered the parlour, and saw Mr Tooke's eyes fixed on him.</s> <s sid="68" id="crofton.c1.s68">But his mother only wanted him to shut the door as he passed; that was all.</s> <s sid="69" id="crofton.c1.s69">It had stood open, as it usually did on warm days.</s> <s sid="70" id="crofton.c1.s70">Could his mother wish it shut on account of anything she was saying?</s> <s sid="71" id="crofton.c1.s71">It was possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="crofton.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="crofton.c1.s72"><qs/>"O Hugh!"<qe/> exclaimed Agnes, as soon as he set foot on the leads.</s> <s sid="73" id="crofton.c1.s73"><qs/>"What do you think?--But is the parlour-door shut?</s> <s sid="74" id="crofton.c1.s74">Who shut it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="crofton.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="crofton.c1.s75"><qs/>"Mother bade me shut it, as I passed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="crofton.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="crofton.c1.s76"><qs/>"O dear!"<qe/><sls/> said Agnes, in a tone of disappointment; <sle/><qs/>"then she did not mean us to hear what they were talking about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="crofton.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="crofton.c1.s77"><qs/>"What was it?</s> <s sid="78" id="crofton.c1.s78">Anything about the Crofton boys?</s> <s sid="79" id="crofton.c1.s79">Anything about Phil?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="crofton.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="crofton.c1.s80"><qs/>"I cannot tell you a word about it.</s> <s sid="81" id="crofton.c1.s81">Mamma did not know I heard them.</s> <s sid="82" id="crofton.c1.s82">How plain anyone can hear what they say in that parlour, Hugh, when the door is open!</s> <s sid="83" id="crofton.c1.s83">What do you think I heard mamma tell Mrs Bicknor, last week, when I was jumping Harry off the third stair?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="crofton.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="crofton.c1.s84"><qs/>"Never mind that.</s> <s sid="85" id="crofton.c1.s85">Tell me what they are talking about now.</s> <s sid="86" id="crofton.c1.s86">Do, Agnes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="crofton.c1.p19"><s sid="87" id="crofton.c1.s87">Agnes shook her head.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="crofton.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="crofton.c1.s88"><qs/>"Now do, dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="crofton.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="crofton.c1.s89">It was hard for Agnes to refuse Hugh anything, at any time; more still when he called her <qs/>"dear,"<qe/> which he seldom did; and most of all when he put his arm round her neck, as he did now.</s> <s sid="90" id="crofton.c1.s90">But she answered--</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="crofton.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="crofton.c1.s91"><qs/>"I should like to tell you every word; but I cannot now.</s> <s sid="92" id="crofton.c1.s92">Mamma has made you shut the door.</s> <s sid="93" id="crofton.c1.s93">She does not wish you to hear it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="crofton.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="crofton.c1.s98"><qs/>"That is too bad!"<qe/> exclaimed Hugh, flinging himself down on the leads so vehemently that his sister was afraid he would roll over into the yard.</s> <s sid="99" id="crofton.c1.s99"><qs/>"What does Jane care about Crofton and the boys to what I do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="crofton.c5.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="crofton.c5.s21">The school-room looked chilly and dull, as there was no sunshine in it till the afternoon; and still Mr Tooke was not there, as Hugh had hoped he would be.</s> <s sid="22" id="crofton.c5.s22">Mrs Watson and the servants came in for prayers, which were well read by the usher; and then everybody went to business:-- everybody but Hugh and Holt, who had nothing to do.</s> <s sid="23" id="crofton.c5.s23">Class after class came up for repetition; and this repetition seemed to the new boys an accomplishment they should never acquire.</s> <s sid="24" id="crofton.c5.s24">They did not think that any practice would enable them to gabble, as everybody seemed able to gabble here.</s> <s sid="25" id="crofton.c5.s25">Hugh had witnessed something of it before,--Phil having been wont to run off at home, <qs/>"Sal, Sol, Ren et Splen,"<qe/> to the end of the passage, for the admiration of his sisters, and so much to little Harry's amusement, that Susan, however busy she might be, came to listen, and then asked him to say it again, that cook might hear what he learned at school.</s> <s sid="26" id="crofton.c5.s26">Hugh now thought that none of them gabbled quite so fast as Phil: but he soon found out, by a glance or two of Phil's to one side, that he was trying to astonish the new boys.</s> <s sid="27" id="crofton.c5.s27">It is surprising how it lightened Hugh's heart to find that his brother did not quite despise, or feel ashamed of him, as he had begun to think: but that he even took pains to show off.</s> <s sid="28" id="crofton.c5.s28">He was sorry too when the usher spoke sharply to Phil, and even rapped his head with the cane, asking him what he spluttered out his nonsense at that rate for.</s> <s sid="29" id="crofton.c5.s29">Thus ended Phil's display; and Hugh felt as hot, and as ready to cry, as if it had happened to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="crofton.c5.p9"><s sid="30" id="crofton.c5.s30">Perhaps the usher saw this; for when he called Hugh up, he was very kind.</s> <s sid="31" id="crofton.c5.s31">He looked at the Latin grammar he had used with Miss Harold, and saw by the dogs'-ears exactly how far Hugh had gone in it, and asked him only what he could answer very well.</s> <s sid="32" id="crofton.c5.s32">Hugh said three declensions, with only one mistake.</s> <s sid="33" id="crofton.c5.s33">Then he was shown the part that he was to say to-morrow morning; and Hugh walked away, all the happier for having something to do, like everybody else.</s> <s sid="34" id="crofton.c5.s34">He was so little afraid of the usher, that he went back to him to ask where he had better sit.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="crofton.c5.p11"><s sid="39" id="crofton.c5.s39">Some of the boys whispered that Mrs Watson's footstool, under her apron, would do: but the usher overheard this, and observed that it took some people a good while to know a new boy; and that they might find that a little fellow might be as much of a man as a big one.</s> <s sid="40" id="crofton.c5.s40">And the usher called the oldest boy in the school, and asked him to see if there was a desk for little Proctor.</s> <s sid="41" id="crofton.c5.s41">There was: and Hugh put into it his two or three school-books, and his slate; and felt that he was now indeed a Crofton boy.</s> <s sid="42" id="crofton.c5.s42">Then, the usher was kinder than he had expected; and he had still to see Mr Tooke, of whom he was not afraid at all.</s> <s sid="43" id="crofton.c5.s43">So Hugh's spirits rose, and he liked the prospect of breakfast as well as any boy in the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="crofton.c5.p12" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="crofton.c5.s44">There was one more rebuff for him, first, however.</s> <s sid="45" id="crofton.c5.s45">He ran up to his room, to finish combing his hair, while the other boys were thronging into the long room to breakfast.</s> <s sid="46" id="crofton.c5.s46">He found the housemaids there, making the beds; and they both cried <qs/>"Out!</s> <s sid="47" id="crofton.c5.s47">Out!"<qe/> and clapped their hands at him, and threatened to tell Mrs Watson of his having broken rules, if he did not go this moment Hugh asked what Mrs Watson would say to his hair, if he went to breakfast with it as it was.</s> <s sid="48" id="crofton.c5.s48">One of the maids was good-natured enough to comb it for him, for once: but she said he must carry a comb in his pocket; as the boys were not allowed to go to their rooms, except at stated hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="crofton.c5.p13"><s sid="49" id="crofton.c5.s49">At last, Hugh saw Mr Tooke.</s> <s sid="50" id="crofton.c5.s50">When the boys entered school at nine o'clock, the master was at his desk.</s> <s sid="51" id="crofton.c5.s51">Hugh went up to his end of the room, with a smiling face, while Tom Holt hung back; and he kept beckoning Tom Holt on, having told him there was nothing to be afraid of.</s> <s sid="52" id="crofton.c5.s52">But when, at last, Mr Tooke saw him, he made no difference between the two, and seemed to forget having ever seen Hugh.</s> <s sid="53" id="crofton.c5.s53">He told them he hoped they would be good boys, and would do credit to Crofton; and then he asked Mr Carnaby to set them something to learn.</s> <s sid="54" id="crofton.c5.s54">And this was all they had to do with Mr Tooke for a long while.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="crofton.c5.p14"><s sid="55" id="crofton.c5.s55">This morning in school, from nine till twelve, seemed the longest morning these little boys had ever known.</s> <s sid="56" id="crofton.c5.s56">When they remembered that the afternoon would be as long, and every morning and afternoon for three months, their hearts sank.</s> <s sid="57" id="crofton.c5.s57">Perhaps, if any one had told them that the time would grow shorter and shorter by use, and at last, when they had plenty to do, almost too short, they would not have believed it, because they could not yet feel it.</s> <s sid="58" id="crofton.c5.s58">But what they now found was only what every boy and girl finds, on beginning school, or entering upon any new way of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="crofton.c5.p15"><s sid="59" id="crofton.c5.s59">Mr Carnaby, who was busy with others, found it rather difficult to fill up their time.</s> <s sid="60" id="crofton.c5.s60">When Hugh had said some Latin, and helped his companion to learn his first Latin lesson, and both had written a copy, and done a sum, Mr Carnaby could not spare them any more time or thought, and told them they might do what they liked, if they only kept quiet, till school was up.</s> <s sid="61" id="crofton.c5.s61">So they made out the ridiculous figures which somebody had carved upon their desks, and the verses, half rubbed out, which were scribbled inside: and then they reckoned, on their slates, how many days there were before the Christmas holidays;--how many school-days, and how many Sundays.</s> <s sid="62" id="crofton.c5.s62">And then Hugh began to draw a steamboat in the Thames, as seen from the leads of his father's house; while Holt drew on his slate the ship in which he came over from India.</s> <s sid="63" id="crofton.c5.s63">But before they had done, the clock struck twelve, school was up, and there was a general rush into the playground.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="crofton.c5.p16"><s sid="64" id="crofton.c5.s64">Now Hugh was really to see the country.</s> <s sid="65" id="crofton.c5.s65">Except that the sun had shone pleasantly into his room in the morning, through waving trees, nothing had yet occurred to make him feel that he was in the country.</s> <s sid="66" id="crofton.c5.s66">Now, however, he was in the open air, with trees sprinkled all over the landscape, and green fields stretching away, and the old church tower half-covered with ivy.</s> <s sid="67" id="crofton.c5.s67">Hugh screamed with pleasure; and nobody thought it odd, for almost every boy was shouting.</s> <s sid="68" id="crofton.c5.s68">Hugh longed to pick up some of the shining brown chestnuts which he had seen yesterday in the road, under the trees; and he was now cantering away to the spot, when Phil ran after him, and roughly stopped him, saying he would get into a fine scrape for the first day, if he went out of bounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="crofton.c5.p17"><s sid="69" id="crofton.c5.s69">Hugh had forgotten there were such things as bounds, and was not at all glad to be reminded of them now.</s> <s sid="70" id="crofton.c5.s70">He sighed as he begged Phil to show him exactly where he might go and where he might not Phil did so in an impatient way, and then was off to trap-ball, because his party were waiting for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="crofton.c5.p18"><s sid="71" id="crofton.c5.s71">The chestnut-trees overhung one corner of the playground, within the paling: and in that corner Hugh found several chestnuts which had burst their sheaths, and lay among the first fallen leaves.</s> <s sid="72" id="crofton.c5.s72">He pocketed them with great delight, wondering that nobody had been before him to secure such a treasure.</s> <s sid="73" id="crofton.c5.s73">Agnes should have some; and little Harry would find them nice playthings.</s> <s sid="74" id="crofton.c5.s74">They looked good to eat too; and he thought he could spare one to taste; so he took out his knife, cut off the point of a fine swelling chestnut, and tasted a bit of the inside.</s> <s sid="75" id="crofton.c5.s75">Just as he was making a face over it, and wondering that it was so nasty, when those which his father roasted in the fire-shovel on Christmas-day were so good, he heard laughter behind him, and found that he was again doing something ridiculous, though he knew not what: and in a moment poor Hugh was as unhappy as ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="crofton.c5.p19"><s sid="76" id="crofton.c5.s76">He ran away from the laughing boys, and went quite to the opposite corner of the playground, where a good number of his schoolfellows were playing ball under the orchard-wall.</s> <s sid="77" id="crofton.c5.s77">Hugh ran hither and thither, like the rest, trying to catch the ball; but he never could do it; and he was jostled, and thrown down, and another boy fell over him; and he was told that he knew nothing about play, and had better move off.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="crofton.c5.p20"><s sid="78" id="crofton.c5.s78">He did so, with a heavy heart, wondering how he was ever to be like the other boys, if nobody would take him in hand, and teach him to play, or even let him learn.</s> <s sid="79" id="crofton.c5.s79">Remembering what his mother expected of him, he tried to sing, to prevent crying, and began to count the pales round the playground, for something to do.</s> <s sid="80" id="crofton.c5.s80">This presently brought him to a tree which stood on the very boundary, its trunk serving instead of two or three pales.</s> <s sid="81" id="crofton.c5.s81">It was only a twisted old apple-tree; but the more twisted and gnarled it was, the more it looked like a tree that Hugh could climb; and he had always longed to climb a tree.</s> <s sid="82" id="crofton.c5.s82">Glancing up, he saw a boy already there, sitting on the fork of two branches, reading.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="crofton.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="crofton.c5.s83"><qs/>"Have you a mind to come up?"<qe/> asked the boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="crofton.c5.p29"><s sid="99" id="crofton.c5.s99">While Hugh sat in the branches, venturing to leave hold with one hand, that he might fan his hot face with his cap, Firth stood on the rail of the palings, holding by the tree, and talking to him.</s> <s sid="100" id="crofton.c5.s100">Firth told him that this was the only tree the boys were allowed to climb, since Ned Reeve had fallen from the great ash, and hurt his spine.</s> <s sid="101" id="crofton.c5.s101">He showed what trees he had himself climbed before that accident; and it made Hugh giddy to think of being within eight feet of the top of the lofty elm in the churchyard, which Firth had thought nothing of mounting.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="crofton.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="crofton.c8.s1">Hugh, meantime, was counting the hours till Saturday.</s> <s sid="2" id="crofton.c8.s2">Perhaps, if the truth were known, so was Phil, though he was too old to acknowledge such a longing.</s> <s sid="3" id="crofton.c8.s3">But the climbing about the mill,--the play encouraged there by his uncle and the men,--his uncle's stories within doors, his aunt's good dinners,--the fire-side, the picture-books, the talk of home, altogether made up the greatest treat of the half-year.</s> <s sid="4" id="crofton.c8.s4">Phil had plenty of ways of passing the time.</s> <s sid="5" id="crofton.c8.s5">Hugh began a long letter home,--the very last letter, except the short formal one which should declare when the Christmas vacation should commence.</s> <s sid="6" id="crofton.c8.s6">Hugh meant to write half the letter before Saturday, and then fill it up with an account of his visit to his uncle's.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="crofton.c8.p2"><s sid="7" id="crofton.c8.s7">The days were passed, however, when Hugh had the command of his leisure time, as on his arrival, when his hours were apt to hang heavy.</s> <s sid="8" id="crofton.c8.s8">He had long since become too valuable in the playground to be left to follow his own devices.</s> <s sid="9" id="crofton.c8.s9">As the youngest boy, he was looked upon as a sort of servant to the rest, when once it was found that he was quick and clever.</s> <s sid="10" id="crofton.c8.s10">Either as scout, messenger, or in some such capacity, he was continually wanted; and often at times inconvenient to himself.</s> <s sid="11" id="crofton.c8.s11">He then usually remembered what Mr Tooke had told him of his boy, when Tooke was the youngest,--how he bore things--not only being put on the high wall, but being well worked in the service of the older boys.</s> <s sid="12" id="crofton.c8.s12">Usually Hugh was obliging, but he could and did feel cross at times.</s> <s sid="13" id="crofton.c8.s13">He was cross on this Friday,--the day when he was so anxious to write his letter before going to his uncle's.</s> <s sid="14" id="crofton.c8.s14">On Saturday there would be no time.</s> <s sid="15" id="crofton.c8.s15">The early mornings were dark now; and after school he should have to wash and dress, and be off to his uncle's.</s> <s sid="16" id="crofton.c8.s16">On Friday then, his paper was ruled, and he had only to run across the playground to borrow Firth's penknife, and then nothing should delay his letter.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="crofton.c8.p3"><s sid="17" id="crofton.c8.s17">In that ran across the playground he was stopped.</s> <s sid="18" id="crofton.c8.s18">He was wanted to collect clean snow for the boys who were bent on finishing their snow-man while it would bind.</s> <s sid="19" id="crofton.c8.s19">He should be let off when he had brought snow enough.</s> <s sid="20" id="crofton.c8.s20">But he knew that by that time his fingers would be too stiff to hold his pen; and he said he did not choose to stop now.</s> <s sid="21" id="crofton.c8.s21">Upon this Lamb launched a snowball in his face.</s> <s sid="22" id="crofton.c8.s22">Hugh grew angry,--or, as his schoolfellows said, insolent.</s> <s sid="23" id="crofton.c8.s23">Some stood between him and the house, to prevent his getting home, while others promised to roll him in the snow till he yielded full submission.</s> <s sid="24" id="crofton.c8.s24">Instead of yielding, Hugh made for the orchard-wall, scrambled up it, and stood for the moment out of the reach of his enemies.</s> <s sid="25" id="crofton.c8.s25">He kicked down such a quantity of snow upon any one who came near, that he held all at bay for some little time.</s> <s sid="26" id="crofton.c8.s26">At last, however, he had disposed of all the snow within his reach, and they were pelting him thickly with snow-balls.</s> <s sid="27" id="crofton.c8.s27">It was not at any time very easy to stand upright, for long together, upon this wall, as the stones which capped it were rounded.</s> <s sid="28" id="crofton.c8.s28">Now, when the coping-stones were slippery after the frost, and Hugh nearly blinded with the shower of snow-balls, he could not keep his footing, and was obliged to sit astride upon the wall.</s> <s sid="29" id="crofton.c8.s29">This brought one foot within reach from below; and though Hugh kicked, and drew up his foot as far and as often as he could, so as not to lose his balance, it was snatched at by many hands.</s> <s sid="30" id="crofton.c8.s30">At last, one hand kept its hold, and plenty more then fastened upon his leg.</s> <s sid="31" id="crofton.c8.s31">They pulled: he clung.</s> <s sid="32" id="crofton.c8.s32">In another moment, down he came, and the large, heavy coping-stone, loosened by the frost, came after him, and fell upon his left foot as he lay.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="crofton.c8.p4"><s sid="33" id="crofton.c8.s33">It was a dreadful shriek that he gave.</s> <s sid="34" id="crofton.c8.s34">Mrs Watson heard it in her store-room, and Mr Tooke in his study.</s> <s sid="35" id="crofton.c8.s35">Some labourers felling a tree in a wood, a quarter of a mile off, heard it, and came running to see what could be the matter.</s> <s sid="36" id="crofton.c8.s36">The whole school was in a cluster round the poor boy in a few seconds.</s> <s sid="37" id="crofton.c8.s37">During this time, while several were engaged in lifting away the stone, Tooke stooped over him, and said, with his lips as white as paper,--</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="crofton.c8.p7" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="crofton.c8.s45"><qs/>"Don't you tell, and then nobody will know.</s> <s sid="46" id="crofton.c8.s46">Mind you don't!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="crofton.c8.p8"><s sid="47" id="crofton.c8.s47">One boy after another turned away from the sight of his foot, when the stone was removed.</s> <s sid="48" id="crofton.c8.s48">Tooke fainted, but, then, so did another boy who had nothing to do with the matter.</s> <s sid="49" id="crofton.c8.s49">Everybody who came up asked who did it; and nobody could answer.</s> <s sid="50" id="crofton.c8.s50">Tooke did not hear; and so many felt themselves concerned, that no one wished that any answer should be given.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="crofton.c8.p9" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="crofton.c8.s51"><qs/>"Who did it, my dear boy?"<qe/> asked Firth, bending over him.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="crofton.c8.p11"><s sid="54" id="crofton.c8.s54">He must not lie there; but who could touch him?</s> <s sid="55" id="crofton.c8.s55">Firth did; and he was the right person, as he was one of the strongest.</s> <s sid="56" id="crofton.c8.s56">He made two boys pass their handkerchiefs under the leg, and sling it, without touching it; and he lifted Hugh, and carried him across his arms towards the house.</s> <s sid="57" id="crofton.c8.s57">They met Mr Tooke, and every person belonging to the household, before they reached the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="crofton.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="crofton.c8.s58"><qs/>"To my bed!"<qe/> said the master, when he saw: and in an instant the gardener had his orders to saddle Mr Tooke's horse, and ride to London for an eminent surgeon: stopping by the way to beg Mr and Mrs Shaw to come, and bring with them the surgeon who was their neighbour, Mr Annanby.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="crofton.c8.p17"><s sid="71" id="crofton.c8.s71">Everybody was very kind, and did the best that could be done.</s> <s sid="72" id="crofton.c8.s72">Hugh was held up on the side of Mr Tooke's bed, while Mrs Watson took off his clothes, cutting the left side of his trousers to pieces, without any hesitation.</s> <s sid="73" id="crofton.c8.s73">The master held the leg firmly while the undressing went on; and then poor Hugh was laid back, and covered up warm, while the foot was placed on a pillow, with only a light handkerchief thrown over it.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="crofton.c8.p18"><s sid="74" id="crofton.c8.s74">It was terrible to witness his pain; but Mr Tooke never left him all day.</s> <s sid="75" id="crofton.c8.s75">He chafed his hands, he gave him drink; he told him he had no doubt his mother would arrive soon; he encouraged him to say or do anything that he thought would give him ease.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="crofton.c15.p2"><s sid="5" id="crofton.c15.s5">Holt's father wrote a letter to Mr Proctor, which reached its destination through Mr Tooke's hands; and Mr Tooke was consulted in the whole matter, and requested by Mr Proctor to tell the two boys and Phil all about it.</s> <s sid="6" id="crofton.c15.s6">These three were therefore called into Mr Tooke's study one day, to hear some news.</s> </p>
