<title>PROLOGUE. THE OLYMPIANS</title>
<p pid="1" id="goldenage.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="goldenage.c1.s1">Looking back to those days of old, ere the gate shut behind me, I can see now that to children with a proper equipment of parents these things would have worn a different aspect.</s> <s sid="2" id="goldenage.c1.s2">But to those whose nearest were aunts and uncles, a special attitude of mind may be allowed.</s> <s sid="3" id="goldenage.c1.s3">They treated us, indeed, with kindness enough as to the needs of the flesh, but after that with indifference (an indifference, as I recognise, the result of a certain stupidity), and therewith the commonplace conviction that your child is merely animal.</s> <s sid="4" id="goldenage.c1.s4">At a very early age I remember realising in a quite impersonal and kindly way the existence of that stupidity, and its tremendous influence in the world; while there grew up in me, as in the parallel case of Caliban upon Setebos, a vague sense of a ruling power, wilful and freakish, and prone to the practice of vagaries--<qs/>"just choosing so:"<qe/> as, for instance, the giving of authority over us to these hopeless and incapable creatures, when it might far more reasonably have been given to ourselves over them.</s> <s sid="5" id="goldenage.c1.s5">These elders, our betters by a trick of chance, commanded no respect, but only a certain blend of envy--of their good luck--and pity--for their inability to make use of it.</s> <s sid="6" id="goldenage.c1.s6">Indeed, it was one of the most hopeless features in their character (when we troubled ourselves to waste a thought on them: which wasn't often) that, having absolute licence to indulge in the pleasures of life, they could get no good of it.</s> <s sid="7" id="goldenage.c1.s7">They might dabble in the pond all day, hunt the chickens, climb trees in the most uncompromising Sunday clothes; they were free to issue forth and buy gunpowder in the full eye of the sun--free to fire cannons and explode mines on the lawn: yet they never did any one of these things.</s> <s sid="8" id="goldenage.c1.s8">No irresistible Energy haled them to church o' Sundays; yet they went there regularly of their own accord, though they betrayed no greater delight in the experience than ourselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="goldenage.c1.p2"><s sid="9" id="goldenage.c1.s9">On the whole, the existence of these Olympians seemed to be entirely void of interests, even as their movements were confined and slow, and their habits stereotyped and senseless.</s> <s sid="10" id="goldenage.c1.s10">To anything but appearances they were blind.</s> <s sid="11" id="goldenage.c1.s11">For them the orchard (a place elf-haunted, wonderful!) simply produced so many apples and cherries: or it didn't, when the failures of Nature were not infrequently ascribed to us.</s> <s sid="12" id="goldenage.c1.s12">They never set foot within fir-wood or hazel-copse, nor dreamt of the marvels hid therein.</s> <s sid="13" id="goldenage.c1.s13">The mysterious sources--sources as of old Nile--that fed the duck-pond had no magic for them.</s> <s sid="14" id="goldenage.c1.s14">They were unaware of Indians, nor recked they anything of bisons or of pirates (with pistols!), though the whole place swarmed with such portents.</s> <s sid="15" id="goldenage.c1.s15">They cared not about exploring for robbers' caves, nor digging for hidden treasure.</s> <s sid="16" id="goldenage.c1.s16">Perhaps, indeed, it was one of their best qualities that they spent the greater part of their time stuffily indoors.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="goldenage.c1.p3"><s sid="17" id="goldenage.c1.s17">To be sure, there was an exception in the curate, who would receive unblenching the information that the meadow beyond the orchard was a prairie studded with herds of buffalo, which it was our delight, moccasined and tomahawked, to ride down with those whoops that announce the scenting of blood.</s> <s sid="18" id="goldenage.c1.s18">He neither laughed nor sneered, as the Olympians would have done; but possessed of a serious idiosyncrasy, he would contribute such lots of valuable suggestion as to the pursuit of this particular sort of big game that, as it seemed to us, his mature age and eminent position could scarce have been attained without a practical knowledge of the creature in its native lair.</s> <s sid="19" id="goldenage.c1.s19">Then, too, he was always ready to constitute himself a hostile army or a band of marauding Indians on the shortest possible notice: in brief, a distinctly able man, with talents, so far as we could judge, immensely above the majority.</s> <s sid="20" id="goldenage.c1.s20">I trust he is a bishop by this time,--he had all the necessary qualifications, as we knew.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="goldenage.c1.p4"><s sid="21" id="goldenage.c1.s21">These strange folk had visitors sometimes,--stiff and colourless Olympians like themselves, equally without vital interests and intelligent pursuits: emerging out of the clouds, and passing away again to drag on an aimless existence somewhere out of our ken.</s> <s sid="22" id="goldenage.c1.s22">Then brute force was pitilessly applied.</s> <s sid="23" id="goldenage.c1.s23">We were captured, washed, and forced into clean collars: silently submitting, as was our wont, with more contempt than anger.</s> <s sid="24" id="goldenage.c1.s24">Anon, with unctuous hair and faces stiffened in a conventional grin, we sat and listened to the usual platitudes.</s> <s sid="25" id="goldenage.c1.s25">How could reasonable people spend their precious time so?</s> <s sid="26" id="goldenage.c1.s26">That was ever our wonder as we bounded forth at last--to the old clay-pit to make pots, or to hunt bears among the hazels.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="goldenage.c1.p5"><s sid="27" id="goldenage.c1.s27">It was incessant matter for amazement how these Olympians would talk over our heads--during meals, for instance--of this or the other social or political inanity, under the delusion that these pale phantasms of reality were among the importances of life.</s> <s sid="28" id="goldenage.c1.s28">We illuminati, eating silently, our heads full of plans and conspiracies, could have told them what real life was.</s> <s sid="29" id="goldenage.c1.s29">We had just left it outside, and were all on fire to get back to it.</s> <s sid="30" id="goldenage.c1.s30">Of course we didn't waste the revelation on them; the futility of imparting our ideas had long been demonstrated.</s> <s sid="31" id="goldenage.c1.s31">One in thought and purpose, linked by the necessity of combating one hostile fate, a power antagonistic ever,--a power we lived to evade,--we had no confidants save ourselves.</s> <s sid="32" id="goldenage.c1.s32">This strange anaemic order of beings was further removed from us, in fact, than the kindly beasts who shared our natural existence in the sun.</s> <s sid="33" id="goldenage.c1.s33">The estrangement was fortified by an abiding sense of injustice, arising from the refusal of the Olympians ever to defend, retract, or admit themselves in the wrong, or to accept similar concessions on our part.</s> <s sid="34" id="goldenage.c1.s34">For instance, when I flung the cat out of an upper window (though I did it from no ill-feeling, and it didn't hurt the cat), I was ready, after a moment's reflection, to own I was wrong, as a gentleman should.</s> <s sid="35" id="goldenage.c1.s35">But was the matter allowed to end there?</s> <s sid="36" id="goldenage.c1.s36">I trow not.</s> <s sid="37" id="goldenage.c1.s37">Again, when Harold was locked up in his room all day, for assault and battery upon a neighbour's pig,--an action he would have scorned, being indeed on the friendliest terms with the porker in question,--there was no handsome expression of regret on the discovery of the real culprit.</s> <s sid="38" id="goldenage.c1.s38">What Harold had felt was not so much the imprisonment,--indeed he had very soon escaped by the window, with assistance from his allies, and had only gone back in time for his release,--as the Olympian habit.</s> <s sid="39" id="goldenage.c1.s39">A word would have set all right; but of course that word was never spoken.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="goldenage.c1.p6"><s sid="40" id="goldenage.c1.s40">Well!</s> <s sid="41" id="goldenage.c1.s41">The Olympians are all past and gone.</s> <s sid="42" id="goldenage.c1.s42">Somehow the sun does not seem to shine so brightly as it used; the trackless meadows of old time have shrunk and dwindled away to a few poor acres.</s> <s sid="43" id="goldenage.c1.s43">A saddening doubt, a dull suspicion, creeps over me.</s> <s sid="44" id="goldenage.c1.s44">Et in Arcadia ego,--I certainly did once inhabit Arcady.</s> <s sid="45" id="goldenage.c1.s45">Can it be I too have become an Olympian?</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 1. A HOLIDAY.</title>
<p pid="1" id="goldenage.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="goldenage.c2.s1">The masterful wind was up and out, shouting and chasing, the lord of the morning.</s> <s sid="2" id="goldenage.c2.s2">Poplars swayed and tossed with a roaring swish; dead leaves sprang aloft, and whirled into space; and all the clear-swept heaven seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="goldenage.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="goldenage.c2.s3">It was one of the first awakenings of the year.</s> <s sid="4" id="goldenage.c2.s4">The earth stretched herself, smiling in her sleep; and everything leapt and pulsed to the stir of the giant's movement.</s> <s sid="5" id="goldenage.c2.s5">With us it was a whole holiday; the occasion a birthday--it matters not whose.</s> <s sid="6" id="goldenage.c2.s6">Some one of us had had presents, and pretty conventional speeches, and had glowed with that sense of heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done to deserve it.</s> <s sid="7" id="goldenage.c2.s7">But the holiday was for all, the rapture of awakening Nature for all, the various outdoor joys of puddles and sun and hedge-breaking for all.</s> <s sid="8" id="goldenage.c2.s8">Colt-like I ran through the meadows, frisking happy heels in the face of Nature laughing responsive.</s> <s sid="9" id="goldenage.c2.s9">Above, the sky was bluest of the blue; wide pools left by the winter's floods flashed the colour back, true and brilliant; and the soft air thrilled with the germinating touch that seemed to kindle something in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose already lurking in sheltered haunts.</s> <s sid="10" id="goldenage.c2.s10">Out into the brimming sun-bathed world I sped, free of lessons, free of discipline and correction, for one day at least.</s> <s sid="11" id="goldenage.c2.s11">My legs ran of themselves, and though I heard my name called faint and shrill behind, there was no stopping for me.</s> <s sid="12" id="goldenage.c2.s12">It was only Harold, I concluded, and his legs, though shorter than mine, were good for a longer spurt than this.</s> <s sid="13" id="goldenage.c2.s13">Then I heard it called again, but this time more faintly, with a pathetic break in the middle; and I pulled up short, recognising Charlotte's plaintive note.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="goldenage.c2.p3"><s sid="14" id="goldenage.c2.s14">She panted up anon, and dropped on the turf beside me.</s> <s sid="15" id="goldenage.c2.s15">Neither had any desire for talk; the glow and the glory of existing on this perfect morning were satisfaction full and sufficient.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="goldenage.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="goldenage.c2.s16"><qs/>"Where's Harold;"<qe/> I asked presently.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="goldenage.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="goldenage.c2.s17"><qs/>"Oh, he's just playin' muffin-man, as usual,"<qe/> said Charlotte with petulance.</s> <s sid="18" id="goldenage.c2.s18"><qs/>"Fancy wanting to be a muffin-man on a whole holiday!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="goldenage.c2.p6"><s sid="19" id="goldenage.c2.s19">It was a strange craze, certainly; but Harold, who invented his own games and played them without assistance, always stuck staunchly to a new fad, till he had worn it quite out.</s> <s sid="20" id="goldenage.c2.s20">Just at present he was a muffin-man, and day and night he went through passages and up and down staircases, ringing a noiseless bell and offering phantom muffins to invisible wayfarers.</s> <s sid="21" id="goldenage.c2.s21">It sounds a poor sort of sport; and yet--to pass along busy streets of your own building, for ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging crowd of your own creation--there were points about the game, it cannot be denied, though it seemed scarce in harmony with this radiant wind-swept morning!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="goldenage.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="goldenage.c2.s22"><qs/>"And Edward, where is he?"<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="goldenage.c2.s23">I questioned again.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="goldenage.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="goldenage.c2.s24"><qs/>"He's coming along by the road,"<qe/> said Charlotte.</s> <s sid="25" id="goldenage.c2.s25"><qs/>"He'll be crouching in the ditch when we get there, and he's going to be a grizzly bear and spring out on us, only you mustn't say I told you, 'cos it's to be a surprise."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="goldenage.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="goldenage.c2.s26"><qs/>"All right,"<qe/> I said magnanimously.</s> <s sid="27" id="goldenage.c2.s27"><qs/>"Come on and let's be surprised."<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="goldenage.c2.s28">But I could not help feeling that on this day of days even a grizzly felt misplaced and common.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="goldenage.c2.p10"><s sid="29" id="goldenage.c2.s29">Sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as we dropped into the road; then ensued shrieks, growlings, revolver-shots, and unrecorded heroisms, till Edward condescended at last to roll over and die, bulking large and grim, an unmitigated grizzly.</s> <s sid="30" id="goldenage.c2.s30">It was an understood thing, that whoever took upon himself to be a bear must eventually die, sooner or later, even if he were the eldest born; else, life would have been all strife and carnage, and the Age of Acorns have displaced our hard-won civilisation.</s> <s sid="31" id="goldenage.c2.s31">This little affair concluded with satisfaction to all parties concerned, we rambled along the road, picking up the defaulting Harold by the way, muffinless now and in his right and social mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="goldenage.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="goldenage.c2.s32"><qs/>"What would you do?"<qe/><sls/> asked Charlotte presently,--the book of the moment always dominating her thoughts until it was sucked dry and cast aside,--<sle/><qs/>"what would you do if you saw two lions in the road, one on each side, and you didn't know if they was loose or if they was chained up?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="goldenage.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="goldenage.c2.s33"><qs/>"Do?"<qe/><sss/> shouted Edward, valiantly, <sse/><qs/>"I should--I should--I should--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="goldenage.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="goldenage.c2.s34">His boastful accents died away into a mumble:</s> <s sid="35" id="goldenage.c2.s35"><qs/>"Dunno what I should do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="goldenage.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="goldenage.c2.s36"><qs/>"Shouldn't do anything,"<qe/> I observed after consideration; and really it would be difficult to arrive at a wiser conclusion.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="goldenage.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="goldenage.c2.s37"><qs/>"If it came to DOING,"<qe/><sss/> remarked Harold, reflectively, <sse/><qs/>"the lions would do all the doing there was to do, wouldn't they?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="goldenage.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="goldenage.c2.s38"><qs/>"But if they was GOOD lions,"<qe/><sss/> rejoined Charlotte, <sse/><qs/>"they would do as they would be done by."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="goldenage.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="goldenage.c2.s39"><qs/>"Ah, but how are you to know a good lion from a bad one?"<qe/> said Edward.</s> <s sid="40" id="goldenage.c2.s40"><qs/>"The books don't tell you at all, and the lions ain't marked any different."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="goldenage.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="goldenage.c2.s41"><qs/>"Why, there aren't any good lions,"<qe/> said Harold, hastily.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="goldenage.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="goldenage.c2.s42"><qs/>"Oh yes, there are, heaps and heaps,"<qe/> contradicted Edward.</s> <s sid="43" id="goldenage.c2.s43"><qs/>"Nearly all the lions in the story-books are good lions.</s> <s sid="44" id="goldenage.c2.s44">There was Androcles' lion, and St.</s> <s sid="45" id="goldenage.c2.s45">Jerome's lion, and--and--the Lion and the Unicorn--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="goldenage.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="goldenage.c2.s46"><qs/>"He beat the Unicorn,"<qe/><sss/> observed Harold, dubiously, <sse/><qs/>"all round the town."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="goldenage.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="goldenage.c2.s47"><qs/>"That PROVES he was a good lion,"<qe/> cried Edwards triumphantly.</s> <s sid="48" id="goldenage.c2.s48"><qs/>"But the question is, how are you to tell 'em when you see 'em?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="goldenage.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="goldenage.c2.s49"><qs/>"_I_ should ask Martha,"<qe/> said Harold of the simple creed.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="goldenage.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="goldenage.c2.s50">Edward snorted contemptuously, then turned to Charlotte.</s> <s sid="51" id="goldenage.c2.s51"><qs/>"Look here,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"let's play at lions, anyhow, and I'll run on to that corner and be a lion,--I'll be two lions, one on each side of the road,--and you'll come along, and you won't know whether I'm chained up or not, and that'll be the fun!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="goldenage.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="goldenage.c2.s52"><qs/>"No, thank you,"<qe/><sss/> said Charlotte, firmly; <sse/><qs/>"you'll be chained up till I'm quite close to you, and then you'll be loose, and you'll tear me in pieces, and make my frock all dirty, and p'raps you'll hurt me as well.</s> <s sid="53" id="goldenage.c2.s53">_I_ know your lions!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="goldenage.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="goldenage.c2.s54"><qs/>"No, I won't; I swear I won't,"<qe/> protested Edward.</s> <s sid="55" id="goldenage.c2.s55"><qs/>"I'll be quite a new lion this time,--something you can't even imagine."<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="goldenage.c2.s56">And he raced off to his post.</s> <s sid="57" id="goldenage.c2.s57">Charlotte hesitated; then she went timidly on, at each step growing less Charlotte, the mummer of a minute, and more the anxious Pilgrim of all time.</s> <s sid="58" id="goldenage.c2.s58">The lion's wrath waxed terrible at her approach; his roaring filled the startled air.</s> <s sid="59" id="goldenage.c2.s59">I waited until they were both thoroughly absorbed, and then I slipped through the hedge out of the trodden highway, into the vacant meadow spaces.</s> <s sid="60" id="goldenage.c2.s60">It was not that I was unsociable, nor that I knew Edward's lions to the point of satiety; but the passion and the call of the divine morning were high in my blood.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="goldenage.c2.p26"><s sid="61" id="goldenage.c2.s61">Earth to earth!</s> <s sid="62" id="goldenage.c2.s62">That was the frank note, the joyous summons of the day; and they could not but jar and seem artificial, these human discussions and pretences, when boon Nature, reticent no more, was singing that full-throated song of hers that thrills and claims control of every fibre.</s> <s sid="63" id="goldenage.c2.s63">The air was wine; the moist earth-smell, wine; the lark's song, the wafts from the cow-shed at top of the field, the pant and smoke of a distant train,--all were wine,--or song, was it? or odour, this unity they all blended into?</s> <s sid="64" id="goldenage.c2.s64">I had no words then to describe it, that earth-effluence of which I was so conscious; nor, indeed, have I found words since.</s> <s sid="65" id="goldenage.c2.s65">I ran sideways, shouting; I dug glad heels into the squelching soil; I splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick; I hurled clods skywards at random, and presently I somehow found myself singing.</s> <s sid="66" id="goldenage.c2.s66">The words were mere nonsense,--irresponsible babble; the tune was an improvisation, a weary, unrhythmic thing of rise and fall: and yet it seemed to me a genuine utterance, and just at that moment the one thing fitting and right and perfect.</s> <s sid="67" id="goldenage.c2.s67">Humanity would have rejected it with scorn, Nature, everywhere singing in the same key, recognised and accepted it without a flicker of dissent.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="goldenage.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="goldenage.c2.s68">All the time the hearty wind was calling to me companionably from where he swung and bellowed in the tree-tops.</s> <s sid="69" id="goldenage.c2.s69"><qs/>"Take me for guide to-day,"<qe/> he seemed to plead.</s> <s sid="70" id="goldenage.c2.s70"><qs/>"Other holidays you have tramped it in the track of the stolid, unswerving sun; a belated truant, you have dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale, expressionless moon for company.</s> <s sid="71" id="goldenage.c2.s71">To-day why not I, the trickster, the hypocrite?</s> <s sid="72" id="goldenage.c2.s72">I, who whip round corners and bluster, relapse and evade, then rally and pursue!</s> <s sid="73" id="goldenage.c2.s73">I can lead you the best and rarest dance of any; for I am the strong capricious one, the lord of misrule, and I alone am irresponsible and unprincipled, and obey no law."<qe/></s> <s sid="74" id="goldenage.c2.s74">And for me, I was ready enough to fall in with the fellow's humour; was not this a whole holiday?</s> <s sid="75" id="goldenage.c2.s75">So we sheered off together, arm-in-arm, so to speak; and with fullest confidence I took the jigging, thwartwise course my chainless pilot laid for me.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="goldenage.c5.p2"><s sid="5" id="goldenage.c5.s5">Perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head; or nature and the perfect morning joined to him at disaffection; anyhow, having breakfasted, and triumphantly repeated the collect I had broken down in the last Sunday--'twas one without rhythm or alliteration: a most objectionable collect--having achieved thus much, the small natural man in me rebelled, and I vowed, as I straddled and spat about the stable-yard in feeble imitation of the coachman, that lessons might go to the Inventor of them.</s> <s sid="6" id="goldenage.c5.s6">It was only geography that morning, any way: and the practical thing was worth any quantity of bookish theoretic; as for me, I was going on my travels, and imports and exports, populations and capitals, might very well wait while I explored the breathing, coloured world outside.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="goldenage.c17.p13"><s sid="67" id="goldenage.c17.s67">When next day the hour for action arrived, Harold evaded Olympian attention with an easy modesty born of long practice, and made off for the front gate.</s> <s sid="68" id="goldenage.c17.s68">Selina, who had been keeping her eye upon him, thought he was going down to the pond to catch frogs, a joy they had planned to share together, and made after him; but Harold, though he heard her footsteps, continued sternly on his high mission, without even looking back; and Selina was left to wander disconsolately among flower-beds that had lost--for her--all scent and colour.</s> <s sid="69" id="goldenage.c17.s69">I saw it all, and although cold reason approved our line of action, instinct told me we were brutes.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="goldenage.c17.p14"><s sid="70" id="goldenage.c17.s70">Harold reached the town--so he recounted afterwards--in record time, having run most of the way for fear the tea-things, which had reposed six months in the window, should be snapped up by some other conscience-stricken lacerator of a sister's feelings; and it seemed hardly credible to find them still there, and their owner willing to part with them for the price marked on the ticket.</s> <s sid="71" id="goldenage.c17.s71">He paid his money down at once, that there should be no drawing back from the bargain; and then, as the things had to be taken out of the window and packed, and the afternoon was yet young, he thought he might treat himself to a taste of urban joys and la vie de Boheme.</s> <s sid="72" id="goldenage.c17.s72">Shops came first, of course, and he flattened his nose successively against the window with the india-rubber balls in it, and the clock-work locomotive; and against the barber's window, with wigs on blocks, reminding him of uncles, and shaving-cream that looked so good to eat; and the grocer's window, displaying more currants than the whole British population could possibly consume without a special effort; and the window of the bank, wherein gold was thought so little of that it was dealt about in shovels.</s> <s sid="73" id="goldenage.c17.s73">Next there was the market-place, with all its clamorous joys; and when a runaway calf came down the street like a cannon-ball, Harold felt that he had not lived in vain.</s> <s sid="74" id="goldenage.c17.s74">The whole place was so brimful of excitement that he had quite forgotten the why and the wherefore of his being there, when a sight of the church clock recalled him to his better self, and sent him flying out of the town, as he realised he had only just time enough left to get back in.</s> <s sid="75" id="goldenage.c17.s75">If he were after his appointed hour, he would not only miss his high triumph, but probably would be detected as a transgressor of bounds,--a crime before which a private opinion on multiplication sank to nothingness.</s> <s sid="76" id="goldenage.c17.s76">So he jogged along on his homeward way, thinking of many things, and probably talking to himself a good deal, as his habit was, and had covered nearly half the distance, when suddenly--a deadly sinking in the pit of his stomach--a paralysis of every limb--around him a world extinct of light and music--a black sun and a reeling sky--he had forgotten the tea-things!</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="goldenage.c17.p15"><s sid="77" id="goldenage.c17.s77">It was useless, it was hopeless, all was over, and nothing could now be done; nevertheless he turned and ran back wildly, blindly, choking with the big sobs that evoked neither pity nor comfort from a merciless mocking world around; a stitch in his side, dust in his eyes, and black despair clutching at his heart.</s> <s sid="78" id="goldenage.c17.s78">So he stumbled on, with leaden legs and bursting sides, till--as if Fate had not yet dealt him her last worst buffet--on turning a corner in the road he almost ran under the wheels of a dog-cart, in which, as it pulled up, was apparent the portly form of Farmer Larkin, the arch-enemy, whose ducks he had been shying stones at that very morning!</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="goldenage.c17.p16" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="goldenage.c17.s79">Had Harold been in his right and unclouded senses, he would have vanished through the hedge some seconds earlier, rather than pain the farmer by any unpleasant reminiscences which his appearance might call up; but as things were, he could only stand and blubber hopelessly, caring, indeed, little now what further ill might befall him.</s> <s sid="80" id="goldenage.c17.s80">The farmer, for his part, surveyed the desolate figure with some astonishment, calling out in no unfriendly accents, <qs/>"Why, Master Harold! whatever be the matter?</s> <s sid="81" id="goldenage.c17.s81">Baint runnin' away, be ee?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="goldenage.c17.p17"><s sid="82" id="goldenage.c17.s82">Then Harold, with the unnatural courage born of desperation, flung himself on the step, and climbing into the cart, fell in the straw at the bottom of it, sobbing out that he wanted to go back, go back!</s> <s sid="83" id="goldenage.c17.s83">The situation had a vagueness; but the farmer, a man of action rather than words, swung his horse round smartly, and they were in the town again by the time Harold had recovered himself sufficiently to furnish some details.</s> <s sid="84" id="goldenage.c17.s84">As they drove up to the shop, the woman was waiting at the door with the parcel; and hardly a minute seemed to have elapsed since the black crisis, ere they were bowling along swiftly home, the precious parcel hugged in a close embrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="goldenage.c17.p18"><s sid="85" id="goldenage.c17.s85">And now the farmer came out in quite a new and unexpected light.</s> <s sid="86" id="goldenage.c17.s86">Never a word did he say of broken fences and hurdles, of trampled crops and harried flocks and herds.</s> <s sid="87" id="goldenage.c17.s87">One would have thought the man had never possessed a head of live stock in his life.</s> <s sid="88" id="goldenage.c17.s88">Instead, he was deeply interested in the whole dolorous quest of the tea-things, and sympathised with Harold on the disputed point in mathematics as if he had been himself at the same stage of education.</s> <s sid="89" id="goldenage.c17.s89">As they neared home, Harold found himself, to his surprise, sitting up and chatting to his new friend like man to man; and before he was dropped at a convenient gap in the garden hedge, he had promised that when Selina gave her first public tea-party, little Miss Larkin should be invited to come and bring ha whole sawdust family along with her; and the farmer appeared as pleased and proud as if he hat been asked to a garden-party at Marlborough House.</s> <s sid="90" id="goldenage.c17.s90">Really, those Olympians have certain good points, far down in them.</s> <s sid="91" id="goldenage.c17.s91">I shall have to leave off abusing them some day.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="goldenage.c17.p19"><s sid="92" id="goldenage.c17.s92">At the hour of five, Selina, having spent the afternoon searching for Harold in all his accustomed haunts, sat down disconsolately to tea with her dolls, who ungenerously refused to wait beyond the appointed hour.</s> <s sid="93" id="goldenage.c17.s93">The wooden tea-things seemed more chipped than usual; and the dolls themselves had more of wax and sawdust, and less of human colour and intelligence about them, than she ever remembered before.</s> <s sid="94" id="goldenage.c17.s94">It was then that Harold burst in, very dusty, his stockings at his heels, and the channels ploughed by tears still showing on his grimy cheeks; and Selina was at last permitted to know that he had been thinking of her ever since his ill-judged exhibition of temper, and that his sulks had not been the genuine article, nor had he gone frogging by himself.</s> <s sid="95" id="goldenage.c17.s95">It was a very happy hostess who dispensed hospitality that evening to a glassy-eyed stiff-kneed circle; and many a dollish gaucherie, that would have been severely checked on ordinary occasions, was as much overlooked as if it had been a birthday.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="goldenage.c17.p20"><s sid="96" id="goldenage.c17.s96">But Harold and I, in our stupid masculine way, thought all her happiness sprang from possession of the long-coveted tea-service.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="goldenage.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="goldenage.c18.s1">Among the many fatuous ideas that possessed the Olympian noddle, this one was pre-eminent; that, being Olympians, they could talk quite freely in our presence on subjects of the closest import to us, so long as names, dates, and other landmarks were ignored.</s> <s sid="2" id="goldenage.c18.s2">We were supposed to be denied the faculty for putting two and two together; and, like the monkeys, who very sensibly refrain from speech lest they should be set to earn their livings, we were careful to conceal our capabilities for a simple syllogism.</s> <s sid="3" id="goldenage.c18.s3">Thus we were rarely taken by surprise, and so were considered by our disappointed elders to be apathetic and to lack the divine capacity for wonder.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="goldenage.c18.p2"><s sid="4" id="goldenage.c18.s4">Now the daily output of the letter-bag, with the mysterious discussions that ensued thereon, had speedily informed us that Uncle Thomas was intrusted with a mission,--a mission, too, affecting ourselves.</s> <s sid="5" id="goldenage.c18.s5">Uncle Thomas's missions were many and various; a self-important man, one liking the business while protesting that he sank under the burden, he was the missionary, so to speak, of our remote habitation.</s> <s sid="6" id="goldenage.c18.s6">The matching a ribbon, the running down to the stores, the interviewing a cook,--these and similar duties lent constant colour and variety to his vacant life in London and helped to keep down his figure.</s> <s sid="7" id="goldenage.c18.s7">When the matter, however, had in our presence to be referred to with nods and pronouns, with significant hiatuses and interpolations in the French tongue, then the red flag was flown, the storm-cone hoisted, and by a studious pretence of inattention we were not long in plucking out the heart of the mystery.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="goldenage.c18.p3"><s sid="8" id="goldenage.c18.s8">To clinch our conclusion, we descended suddenly and together on Martha; proceeding, however, not by simple inquiry as to facts,--that would never have done,--but by informing her that the air was full of school and that we knew all about it, and then challenging denial.</s> <s sid="9" id="goldenage.c18.s9">Martha was a trusty soul, but a bad witness for the defence, and we soon had it all out of her.</s> <s sid="10" id="goldenage.c18.s10">The word had gone forth, the school had been selected; the necessary sheets were hemming even now; and Edward was the designated and appointed victim.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="goldenage.c18.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="goldenage.c18.s11">It had always been before us as an inevitable bourne, this strange unknown thing called school; and yet--perhaps I should say consequently--we had never seriously set ourselves to consider what it really meant.</s> <s sid="12" id="goldenage.c18.s12">But now that the grim spectre loomed imminent, stretching lean hands for one of our flock, it behoved us to face the situation, to take soundings in this uncharted sea and find out whither we were drifting.</s> <s sid="13" id="goldenage.c18.s13">Unfortunately, the data in our possession were absolutely insufficient, and we knew not whither to turn for exact information.</s> <s sid="14" id="goldenage.c18.s14">Uncle Thomas could have told us all about it, of course; he had been there himself, once, in the dim and misty past.</s> <s sid="15" id="goldenage.c18.s15">But an unfortunate conviction, that Nature had intended him for a humourist, tainted all his evidence, besides making it wearisome to hear.</s> <s sid="16" id="goldenage.c18.s16">Again, of such among our contemporaries as we had approached, the trumpets gave forth an uncertain sound.</s> <s sid="17" id="goldenage.c18.s17">According to some, it meant larks, revels, emancipation, and a foretaste of the bliss of manhood.</s> <s sid="18" id="goldenage.c18.s18">According to others,--the majority, alas!--it was a private and peculiar Hades, that could give the original institution points and a beating.</s> <s sid="19" id="goldenage.c18.s19">When Edward was observed to be swaggering round with a jaunty air and his chest stuck out, I knew that he was contemplating his future from the one point of view.</s> <s sid="20" id="goldenage.c18.s20">When, on the contrary, he was subdued and unaggressive, and sought the society of his sisters, I recognised that the other aspect was in the ascendant.</s> <s sid="21" id="goldenage.c18.s21"><qs/>"You can always run away, you know,"<qe/> I used to remark consolingly on these latter occasions; and Edward would brighten up wonderfully at the suggestion, while Charlotte melted into tears before her vision of a brother with blistered feet and an empty belly, passing nights of frost 'neath the lee of windy haystacks.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="goldenage.c18.p5"><s sid="22" id="goldenage.c18.s22">It was to Edward, of course, that the situation was chiefly productive of anxiety; and yet the ensuing change in my own circumstances and position furnished me also with food for grave reflexion.</s> <s sid="23" id="goldenage.c18.s23">Hitherto I had acted mostly to orders.</s> <s sid="24" id="goldenage.c18.s24">Even when I had devised and counselled any particular devilry, it had been carried out on Edward's approbation, and--as eldest--at his special risk.</s> <s sid="25" id="goldenage.c18.s25">Henceforward I began to be anxious of the bugbear Responsibility, and to realise what a soul-throttling thing it is.</s> <s sid="26" id="goldenage.c18.s26">True, my new position would have its compensations.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="goldenage.c18.p6"><s sid="27" id="goldenage.c18.s27">Edward had been masterful exceedingly, imperious, perhaps a little narrow; impassioned for hard facts, and with scant sympathy for make-believe.</s> <s sid="28" id="goldenage.c18.s28">I should now be free and untrammelled; in the conception and carrying out of a scheme, I could accept and reject to better artistic purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="goldenage.c18.p8"><s sid="41" id="goldenage.c18.s41">And yet, did this and other gains really out-balance my losses?</s> <s sid="42" id="goldenage.c18.s42">Henceforth I should, it was true, be leader and chief; but I should also be the buffer between the Olympians and my little clan.</s> <s sid="43" id="goldenage.c18.s43">To Edward this had been nothing; he had withstood the impact of Olympus without flinching, like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved.</s> <s sid="44" id="goldenage.c18.s44">But was I equal to the task?</s> <s sid="45" id="goldenage.c18.s45">And was there not rather a danger that for the sake of peace and quietness I might be tempted to compromise, compound, and make terms? sinking thus, by successive lapses, into the Blameless Prig?</s> <s sid="46" id="goldenage.c18.s46">I don't mean, of course, that I thought out my thoughts to the exact point here set down.</s> <s sid="47" id="goldenage.c18.s47">In those fortunate days of old one was free from the hard necessity of transmuting the vague idea into the mechanical inadequate medium of words.</s> <s sid="48" id="goldenage.c18.s48">But the feeling was there, that I might not possess the qualities of character for so delicate a position.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="goldenage.c18.p9" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="goldenage.c18.s49">The unnatural halo round Edward got more pronounced, his own demeanour more responsible and dignified, with the arrival of his new clothes.</s> <s sid="50" id="goldenage.c18.s50">When his trunk and play-box were sent in, the approaching cleavage between our brother, who now belonged to the future, and ourselves, still claimed by the past, was accentuated indeed.</s> <s sid="51" id="goldenage.c18.s51">His name was painted on each of them, in large letters, and after their arrival their owner used to disappear mysteriously, and be found eventually wandering round his luggage, murmuring to himself, <qs/>"Edward----,"<qe/> in a rapt, remote sort of way.</s> <s sid="52" id="goldenage.c18.s52">It was a weakness, of course, and pointed to a soft spot in his character; but those who can remember the sensation of first seeing their names in print will not think hardly of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="goldenage.c18.p10" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="goldenage.c18.s53">As the short days sped by and the grim event cast its shadow longer and longer across our threshold, an unnatural politeness, a civility scarce canny, began to pervade the air.</s> <s sid="54" id="goldenage.c18.s54">In those latter hours Edward himself was frequently heard to say <qs/>"Please,"<qe/><sss/> and also <sse/><qs/>"Would you mind fetchin' that ball?"<qe/> while Harold and I would sometimes actually find ourselves trying to anticipate his wishes.</s> <s sid="55" id="goldenage.c18.s55">As for the girls, they simply grovelled.</s> <s sid="56" id="goldenage.c18.s56">The Olympians, too, in their uncouth way, by gift of carnal delicacies and such-like indulgence, seemed anxious to demonstrate that they had hitherto misjudged this one of us.</s> <s sid="57" id="goldenage.c18.s57">Altogether the situation grew strained and false, and I think a general relief was felt when the end came.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="goldenage.c18.p11"><s sid="58" id="goldenage.c18.s58">We all trooped down to the station, of course; it is only in later years that the farce of "seeing people off" is seen in its true colours.</s> <s sid="59" id="goldenage.c18.s59">Edward was the life and soul of the party; and if his gaiety struck one at times as being a trifle overdone, it was not a moment to be critical.</s> <s sid="60" id="goldenage.c18.s60">As we tramped along, I promised him I would ask Farmer Larkin not to kill any more pigs till he came back for the holidays, and he said he would send me a proper catapult,--the real lethal article, not a kid's plaything.</s> <s sid="61" id="goldenage.c18.s61">Then suddenly, when we were about half-way down, one of the girls fell a-snivelling.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="goldenage.c18.p12"><s sid="62" id="goldenage.c18.s62">The happy few who dare to laugh at the woes of sea-sickness will perhaps remember how, on occasion, the sudden collapse of a fellow-voyager before their very eyes has caused them hastily to revise their self-confidence and resolve to walk more humbly for the future.</s> <s sid="63" id="goldenage.c18.s63">Even so it was with Edward, who turned his head aside, feigning an interest in the landscape.</s> <s sid="64" id="goldenage.c18.s64">It was but for a moment; then he recollected the hat he was wearing,--a hard bowler, the first of that sort he had ever owned.</s> <s sid="65" id="goldenage.c18.s65">He took it off, examined it, and felt it over.</s> <s sid="66" id="goldenage.c18.s66">Something about it seemed to give him strength, and he was a man once more.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="goldenage.c18.p13"><s sid="67" id="goldenage.c18.s67">At the station, Edward's first care was to dispose his boxes on the platform so that every one might see the labels and the lettering thereon.</s> <s sid="68" id="goldenage.c18.s68">One did not go to school for the first time every day!</s> <s sid="69" id="goldenage.c18.s69">Then he read both sides of his ticket carefully; shifted it to every one of his pockets in turn; and finally fell to chinking of his money, to keep his courage up.</s> <s sid="70" id="goldenage.c18.s70">We were all dry of conversation by this time, and could only stand round and stare in silence at the victim decked for the altar.</s> <s sid="71" id="goldenage.c18.s71">And, as I looked at Edward, in new clothes of a manly cut, with a hard hat upon his head, a railway ticket in one pocket and money of his own in the other,--money to spend as he liked and no questions asked!--I began to feel dimly how great was the gulf already yawning betwixt us.</s> <s sid="72" id="goldenage.c18.s72">Fortunately I was not old enough to realise, further, that here on this little platform the old order lay at its last gasp, and that Edward might come back to us, but it would not be the Edward of yore, nor could things ever be the same again.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="goldenage.c18.p14"><s sid="73" id="goldenage.c18.s73">When the train steamed up at last, we all boarded it impetuously with the view of selecting the one peerless carriage to which Edward might be intrusted with the greatest comfort and honour; and as each one found the ideal compartment at the same moment, and vociferously maintained its merits, he stood some chance for a time of being left behind.</s> <s sid="74" id="goldenage.c18.s74">A porter settled the matter by heaving him through the nearest door; and as the train moved off, Edward's head was thrust out of the window, wearing on it an unmistakable first-quality grin that he had been saving up somewhere for the supreme moment.</s> <s sid="75" id="goldenage.c18.s75">Very small and white his face looked, on the long side of the retreating train.</s> <s sid="76" id="goldenage.c18.s76">But the grin was visible, undeniable, stoutly maintained; till a curve swept him from our sight, and he was borne away in the dying rumble, out of our placid backwater, out into the busy world of rubs and knocks and competition, out into the New Life.</s> </p>
