<qe/><title>PREFACE.</title>
<p pid="1" id="portraitone.c0.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="portraitone.c0.s1"><qs/>"_The Portrait of a Lady_"<qe/><sss/> was, like <sse/><qs/>"_Roderick Hudson_,"<qe/> begun in Florence, during three months spent there in the spring of 1879.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraitone.c0.s2">Like "Roderick" and like <qs/>"_The American_,"<qe/><sls/> it had been designed for publication in <sle/><qs/>"_The Atlantic Monthly_,"<qe/> where it began to appear in 1880.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraitone.c0.s3">It differed from its two predecessors, however, in finding a course also open to it, from month to month, in "_Macmillan's Magazine_"; which was to be for me one of the last occasions of simultaneous "serialisation" in the two countries that the changing conditions of literary intercourse between England and the United States had up to then left unaltered.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraitone.c0.s4">It is a long novel, and I was long in writing it; I remember being again much occupied with it, the following year, during a stay of several weeks made in Venice.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraitone.c0.s5">I had rooms on Riva Schiavoni, at the top of a house near the passage leading off to San Zaccaria; the waterside life, the wondrous lagoon spread before me, and the ceaseless human chatter of Venice came in at my windows, to which I seem to myself to have been constantly driven, in the fruitless fidget of composition, as if to see whether, out in the blue channel, the ship of some right suggestion, of some better phrase, of the next happy twist of my subject, the next true touch for my canvas, mightn't come into sight.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraitone.c0.s6">But I recall vividly enough that the response most elicited, in general, to these restless appeals was the rather grim admonition that romantic and historic sites, such as the land of Italy abounds in, offer the artist a questionable aid to concentration when they themselves are not to be the subject of it.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraitone.c0.s7">They are too rich in their own life and too charged with their own meanings merely to help him out with a lame phrase; they draw him away from his small question to their own greater ones; so that, after a little, he feels, while thus yearning toward them in his difficulty, as if he were asking an army of glorious veterans to help him to arrest a peddler who has given him the wrong change.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraitone.c0.p2"><s sid="8" id="portraitone.c0.s8">There are pages of the book which, in the reading over, have seemed to make me see again the bristling curve of the wide Riva, the large colour-spots of the balconied houses and the repeated undulation of the little hunchbacked bridges, marked by the rise and drop again, with the wave, of foreshortened clicking pedestrians.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraitone.c0.s9">The Venetian footfall and the Venetian cry--all talk there, wherever uttered, having the pitch of a call across the water--come in once more at the window, renewing one's old impression of the delighted senses and the divided, frustrated mind.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraitone.c0.s10">How can places that speak <i>in general</i> so to the imagination not give it, at the moment, the particular thing it wants?</s> <s sid="11" id="portraitone.c0.s11">I recollect again and again, in beautiful places, dropping into that wonderment.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraitone.c0.s12">The real truth is, I think, that they express, under this appeal, only too much--more than, in the given case, one has use for; so that one finds one's self working less congruously, after all, so far as the surrounding picture is concerned, than in presence of the moderate and the neutral, to which we may lend something of the light of our vision.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraitone.c0.s13">Such a place as Venice is too proud for such charities; Venice doesn't borrow, she but all magnificently gives.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraitone.c0.s14">We profit by that enormously, but to do so we must either be quite off duty or be on it in her service alone.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraitone.c0.s15">Such, and so rueful, are these reminiscences; though on the whole, no doubt, one's book, and one's "literary effort" at large, were to be the better for them.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraitone.c0.s16">Strangely fertilising, in the long run, does a wasted effort of attention often prove.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraitone.c0.s17">It all depends on _how_ the attention has been cheated, has been squandered.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraitone.c0.s18">There are high-handed insolent frauds, and there are insidious sneaking ones.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraitone.c0.s19">And there is, I fear, even on the most designing artist's part, always witless enough good faith, always anxious enough desire, to fail to guard him against their deceits.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraitone.c0.p3" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="portraitone.c0.s20">Trying to recover here, for recognition, the germ of my idea, I see that it must have consisted not at all in any conceit of a <qs/>"plot,"<qe/><sls/> nefarious name, in any flash, upon the fancy, of a set of relations, or in any one of those situations that, by a logic of their own, immediately fall, for the fabulist, into movement, into a march or a rush, a patter of quick steps; but altogether in the sense of a single character, the character and aspect of a particular engaging young woman, to which all the usual elements of a <sle/><qs/>"subject,"<qe/> certainly of a setting, were to need to be super added.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraitone.c0.s21">Quite as interesting as the young woman herself at her best, do I find, I must again repeat, this projection of memory upon the whole matter of the growth, in one's imagination, of some such apology for a motive.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraitone.c0.s22">These are the fascinations of the fabulist's art, these lurking forces of expansion, these necessities of upspringing in the seed, these beautiful determinations, on the part of the idea entertained, to grow as tall as possible, to push into the light and the air and thickly flower there; and, quite as much, these fine possibilities of recovering, from some good standpoint on the ground gained, the intimate history of the business--of retracing and reconstructing its steps and stages.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraitone.c0.s23">I have always fondly remembered a remark that I heard fall years ago from the lips of Ivan Turgenieff in regard to his own experience of the usual origin of the fictive picture.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraitone.c0.s24">It began for him almost always with the vision of some person or persons, who hovered before him, soliciting him, as the active or passive figure, interesting him and appealing to him just as they were and by what they were.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraitone.c0.s25">He saw them, in that fashion, as disponibles, saw them subject to the chances, the complications of existence, and saw them vividly, but then had to find for them the right relations, those that would most bring them out; to imagine, to invent and select and piece together the situations most useful and favourable to the sense of the creatures themselves, the complications they would be most likely to produce and to feel.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraitone.c0.p4" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="portraitone.c0.s26"><qs/>"To arrive at these things is to arrive at my story,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"and that's the way I look for it.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraitone.c0.s27">The result is that I'm often accused of not having 'story' enough.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraitone.c0.s28">I seem to myself to have as much as I need--to show my people, to exhibit their relations with each other; for that is all my measure.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraitone.c0.s29">If I watch them long enough I see them come together, I see them _placed_, I see them engaged in this or that act and in this or that difficulty.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraitone.c0.s30">How they look and move and speak and behave, always in the setting I have found for them, is my account of them--of which I dare say, alas, _que cela manque souvent d'architecture_.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraitone.c0.s31">But I would rather, I think, have too little architecture than too much--when there's danger of its interfering with my measure of the truth.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraitone.c0.s32">The French of course like more of it than I give--having by their own genius such a hand for it; and indeed one must give all one can.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraitone.c0.s33">As for the origin of one's wind-blown germs themselves, who shall say, as you ask, where _they_ come from?</s> <s sid="34" id="portraitone.c0.s34">We have to go too far back, too far behind, to say.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraitone.c0.s35">Isn't it all we can say that they come from every quarter of heaven, that they are _there_ at almost any turn of the road?</s> <s sid="36" id="portraitone.c0.s36">They accumulate, and we are always picking them over, selecting among them.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraitone.c0.s37">They are the breath of life--by which I mean that life, in its own way, breathes them upon us.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraitone.c0.s38">They are so, in a manner prescribed and imposed--floated into our minds by the current of life.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraitone.c0.s39">That reduces to imbecility the vain critic's quarrel, so often, with one's subject, when he hasn't the wit to accept it.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraitone.c0.s40">Will he point out then which other it should properly have been?--his office being, essentially to point out.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraitone.c0.s41">_Il en serait bien embarrasse_.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraitone.c0.s42">Ah, when he points out what I've done or failed to do with it, that's another matter: there he's on his ground.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraitone.c0.s43">I give him up my 'sarchitecture,'"<qe/><sss/> my distinguished friend concluded, <sse/><qs/>"as much as he will."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="portraitone.c0.p5"><s sid="44" id="portraitone.c0.s44">So this beautiful genius, and I recall with comfort the gratitude I drew from his reference to the intensity of suggestion that may reside in the stray figure, the unattached character, the image _en disponibilite_.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraitone.c0.s45">It gave me higher warrant than I seemed then to have met for just that blest habit of one's own imagination, the trick of investing some conceived or encountered individual, some brace or group of individuals, with the germinal property and authority.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraitone.c0.s46">I was myself so much more antecedently conscious of my figures than of their setting--a too preliminary, a preferential interest in which struck me as in general such a putting of the cart before the horse.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraitone.c0.s47">I might envy, though I couldn't emulate, the imaginative writer so constituted as to see his fable first and to make out its agents afterwards.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraitone.c0.s48">I could think so little of any fable that didn't need its agents positively to launch it; I could think so little of any situation that didn't depend for its interest on the nature of the persons situated, and thereby on their way of taking it.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraitone.c0.s49">There are methods of so-called presentation, I believe among novelists who have appeared to flourish--that offer the situation as indifferent to that support; but I have not lost the sense of the value for me, at the time, of the admirable Russian's testimony to my not needing, all superstitiously, to try and perform any such gymnastic.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraitone.c0.s50">Other echoes from the same source linger with me, I confess, as unfadingly--if it be not all indeed one much-embracing echo.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraitone.c0.s51">It was impossible after that not to read, for one's uses, high lucidity into the tormented and disfigured and bemuddled question of the objective value, and even quite into that of the critical appreciation, of "subject" in the novel.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="portraitone.c0.p6"><s sid="52" id="portraitone.c0.s52">One had had from an early time, for that matter, the instinct of the right estimate of such values and of its reducing to the inane the dull dispute over the "immoral" subject and the moral.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraitone.c0.s53">Recognising so promptly the one measure of the worth of a given subject, the question about it that, rightly answered, disposes of all others--is it valid, in a word, is it genuine, is it sincere, the result of some direct impression or perception of life?--I had found small edification, mostly, in a critical pretension that had neglected from the first all delimitation of ground and all definition of terms.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraitone.c0.s54">The air of my earlier time shows, to memory, as darkened, all round, with that vanity--unless the difference to-day be just in one's own final impatience, the lapse of one's attention.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraitone.c0.s55">There is, I think, no more nutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect dependence of the "moral" sense of a work of art on the amount of felt life concerned in producing it.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraitone.c0.s56">The question comes back thus, obviously, to the kind and the degree of the artist's prime sensibility, which is the soil out of which his subject springs.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraitone.c0.s57">The quality and capacity of that soil, its ability to "grow" with due freshness and straightness any vision of life, represents, strongly or weakly, the projected morality.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraitone.c0.s58">That element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of the subject with some mark made on the intelligence, with some sincere experience.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraitone.c0.s59">By which, at the same time, of course, one is far from contending that this enveloping air of the artist's humanity--which gives the last touch to the worth of the work--is not a widely and wondrously varying element; being on one occasion a rich and magnificent medium and on another a comparatively poor and ungenerous one.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraitone.c0.s60">Here we get exactly the high price of the novel as a literary form--its power not only, while preserving that form with closeness, to range through all the differences of the individual relation to its general subject-matter, all the varieties of outlook on life, of disposition to reflect and project, created by conditions that are never the same from man to man (or, so far as that goes, from man to woman), but positively to appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains, or tends to burst, with a latent extravagance, its mould.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="portraitone.c0.p7"><s sid="61" id="portraitone.c0.s61">The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million--a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraitone.c0.s62">These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraitone.c0.s63">They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraitone.c0.s64">But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraitone.c0.s65">He and his neighbours are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraitone.c0.s66">And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may _not_ open; "fortunately" by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraitone.c0.s67">The spreading field, the human scene, is the "choice of subject"; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the "literary form"; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher--without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist.</s> <s sid="68" id="portraitone.c0.s68">Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has _been_ conscious.</s> <s sid="69" id="portraitone.c0.s69">Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his "moral" reference.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="portraitone.c0.p8" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="portraitone.c0.s70">All this is a long way round, however, for my word about my dim first move toward <qs/>"The Portrait,"<qe/> which was exactly my grasp of a single character--an acquisition I had made, moreover, after a fashion not here to be retraced.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraitone.c0.s71">Enough that I was, as seemed to me, in complete possession of it, that I had been so for a long time, that this had made it familiar and yet had not blurred its charm, and that, all urgently, all tormentingly, I saw it in motion and, so to speak, in transit.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraitone.c0.s72">This amounts to saying that I saw it as bent upon its fate--some fate or other; which, among the possibilities, being precisely the question.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraitone.c0.s73">Thus I had my vivid individual--vivid, so strangely, in spite of being still at large, not confined by the conditions, not engaged in the tangle, to which we look for much of the impress that constitutes an identity.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraitone.c0.s74">If the apparition was still all to be placed how came it to be vivid?--since we puzzle such quantities out, mostly, just by the business of placing them.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraitone.c0.s75">One could answer such a question beautifully, doubtless, if one could do so subtle, if not so monstrous, a thing as to write the history of the growth of one's imagination.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraitone.c0.s76">One would describe then what, at a given time, had extraordinarily happened to it, and one would so, for instance, be in a position to tell, with an approach to clearness, how, under favour of occasion, it had been able to take over (take over straight from life) such and such a constituted, animated figure or form.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraitone.c0.s77">The figure has to that extent, as you see, _been_ placed--placed in the imagination that detains it, preserves, protects, enjoys it, conscious of its presence in the dusky, crowded, heterogeneous back-shop of the mind very much as a wary dealer in precious odds and ends, competent to make an "advance" on rare objects confided to him, is conscious of the rare little "piece" left in deposit by the reduced, mysterious lady of title or the speculative amateur, and which is already there to disclose its merit afresh as soon as a key shall have clicked in a cupboard-door.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="portraitone.c0.p9" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="portraitone.c0.s78">That may he, I recognise, a somewhat superfine analogy for the particular "value" I here speak of, the image of the young feminine nature that I had had for so considerable a time all curiously at my disposal; but it appears to fond memory quite to fit the fact--with the recall, in addition, of my pious desire but to place my treasure right.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraitone.c0.s79">I quite remind myself thus of the dealer resigned not to <qs/>"realise,"<qe/> resigned to keeping the precious object locked up indefinitely rather than commit it, at no matter what price, to vulgar hands.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraitone.c0.s80">For there _are_ dealers in these forms and figures and treasures capable of that refinement.</s> <s sid="81" id="portraitone.c0.s81">The point is, however, that this single small corner-stone, the conception of a certain young woman affronting her destiny, had begun with being all my outfit for the large building of <qs/>"The Portrait of a Lady."<qe/></s> <s sid="82" id="portraitone.c0.s82">It came to be a square and spacious house--or has at least seemed so to me in this going over it again; but, such as it is, it had to be put up round my young woman while she stood there in perfect isolation.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraitone.c0.s83">That is to me, artistically speaking, the circumstance of interest; for I have lost myself once more, I confess, in the curiosity of analysing the structure.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraitone.c0.s84">By what process of logical accretion was this slight <qs/>"personality,"<qe/> the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl, to find itself endowed with the high attributes of a Subject?--and indeed by what thinness, at the best, would such a subject not be vitiated?</s> <s sid="85" id="portraitone.c0.s85">Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it?</s> <s sid="86" id="portraitone.c0.s86">The novel is of its very nature an <qs/>"ado,"<qe/> an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado.</s> <s sid="87" id="portraitone.c0.s87">Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for--for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="portraitone.c0.p10" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="portraitone.c0.s88">One looked it well in the face, I seem to remember, this extravagance; and with the effect precisely of recognising the charm of the problem.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraitone.c0.s89">Challenge any such problem with any intelligence, and you immediately see how full it is of substance; the wonder being, all the while, as we look at the world, how absolutely, how inordinately, the Isabel Archers, and even much smaller female fry, insist on mattering.</s> <s sid="90" id="portraitone.c0.s90">George Eliot has admirably noted it--<qs/>"In these frail vessels is borne onward through the ages the treasure of human affection."<qe/></s> <s sid="91" id="portraitone.c0.s91">In "Romeo and Juliet" Juliet has to be important, just as, in "Adam Bede" and "The Mill on the Floss" and "Middlemarch" and <qs/>"Daniel Deronda,"<qe/> Hetty Sorrel and Maggie Tulliver and Rosamond Vincy and Gwendolen Harleth have to be; with that much of firm ground, that much of bracing air, at the disposal all the while of their feet and their lungs.</s> <s sid="92" id="portraitone.c0.s92">They are typical, none the less, of a class difficult, in the individual case, to make a centre of interest; so difficult in fact that many an expert painter, as for instance Dickens and Walter Scott, as for instance even, in the main, so subtle a hand as that of R.

the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost unbounded.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraitone.c3.s36">There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraitone.c3.s37">Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she thought her grandmother's home romantic.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraitone.c3.s38">There was a covered piazza behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraitone.c3.s39">Isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraitone.c3.s40">On the other side, across the street, was an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers, defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraitone.c3.s41">It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraitone.c3.s42">The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it, she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home, where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraitone.c3.s43">The foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people, she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces, which she used to climb upon a chair to take down.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraitone.c3.s44">When she had found one to her taste--she was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispiece--she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew why, the office.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraitone.c3.s45">Whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had established relations almost human, certainly dramatic.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraitone.c3.s46">There was an old haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraitone.c3.s47">The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraitone.c3.s48">She knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraitone.c3.s49">But she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place which became to the child's imagination, according to its different moods, a region of delight or of terror.</s> </p>

it was scarcely even painful to have to suppose him too generous, too good-natured, too indifferent to sordid considerations.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraitone.c4.s73">Many persons had held that he carried this indifference too far, especially the large number of those to whom he owed money.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraitone.c4.s74">Of their opinions Isabel was never very definitely informed; but it may interest the reader to know that, while they had recognised in the late Mr. Archer a remarkably handsome head and a very taking manner (indeed, as one of them had said, he was always taking something), they had declared that he was making a very poor use of his life.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraitone.c4.s75">He had squandered a substantial fortune, he had been deplorably convivial, he was known to have gambled freely.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraitone.c4.s76">A few very harsh critics went so far as to say that he had not even brought up his daughters.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraitone.c4.s77">They had had no regular education and no permanent home; they had been at once spoiled and neglected; they had lived with nursemaids and governesses (usually very bad ones) or had been sent to superficial schools, kept by the French, from which, at the end of a month, they had been removed in tears.</s> <s sid="78" id="portraitone.c4.s78">This view of the matter would have excited Isabel's indignation, for to her own sense her opportunities had been large.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraitone.c4.s79">Even when her father had left his daughters for three months at Neufchatel with a French _bonne_ who had eloped with a Russian nobleman staying at the same hotel--even in this irregular situation (an incident of the girl's eleventh year) she had been neither frightened nor ashamed, but had thought it a romantic episode in a liberal education.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraitone.c4.s80">Her father had a large way of looking at life, of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency of conduct had been only a proof.</s> <s sid="81" id="portraitone.c4.s81">He wished his daughters, even as children, to see as much of the world as possible; and it was for this purpose that, before Isabel was fourteen, he had transported them three times across the Atlantic, giving them on each occasion, however, but a few months' view of the subject proposed: a course which had whetted our heroine's curiosity without enabling her to satisfy it.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraitone.c4.s82">She ought to have been a partisan of her father, for she was the member of his trio who most "made up" to him for the disagreeables he didn't mention.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraitone.c4.s83">In his last days his general willingness to take leave of a world in which the difficulty of doing as one liked appeared to increase as one grew older had been sensibly modified by the pain of separation from his clever, his superior, his remarkable girl.</s> <s sid="84" id="portraitone.c4.s84">Later, when the journeys to Europe ceased, he still had shown his children all sorts of indulgence, and if he had been troubled about money-matters nothing ever disturbed their irreflective consciousness of many possessions.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraitone.c4.s85">Isabel, though she danced very well, had not the recollection of having been in New York a successful member of the choreographic circle; her sister Edith was, as every one said, so very much more fetching.</s> <s sid="86" id="portraitone.c4.s86">Edith was so striking an example of success that Isabel could have no illusions as to what constituted this advantage, or as to the limits of her own power to frisk and jump and shriek--above all with rightness of effect.</s> <s sid="87" id="portraitone.c4.s87">Nineteen persons out of twenty (including the younger sister herself) pronounced Edith infinitely the prettier of the two; but the twentieth, besides reversing this judgement, had the entertainment of thinking all the others aesthetic vulgarians.</s> <s sid="88" id="portraitone.c4.s88">Isabel had in the depths of her nature an even more unquenchable desire to please than Edith; but the depths of this young lady's nature were a very out-of-the-way place, between which and the surface communication was interrupted by a dozen capricious forces.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraitone.c4.s89">She saw the young men who came in large numbers to see her sister; but as a general thing they were afraid of her; they had a belief that some special preparation was required for talking with her.</s> <s sid="90" id="portraitone.c4.s90">Her reputation of reading a great deal hung about her like the cloudy envelope of a goddess in an epic; it was supposed to engender difficult questions and to keep the conversation at a low temperature.</s> <s sid="91" id="portraitone.c4.s91">The poor girl liked to be thought clever, but she hated to be thought bookish; she used to read in secret and, though her memory was excellent, to abstain from showy reference.</s> <s sid="92" id="portraitone.c4.s92">She had a great desire for knowledge, but she really preferred almost any source of information to the printed page; she had an immense curiosity about life and was constantly staring and wondering.</s> <s sid="93" id="portraitone.c4.s93">She carried within herself a great fund of life, and her deepest enjoyment was to feel the continuity between the movements of her own soul and the agitations of the world.</s> <s sid="94" id="portraitone.c4.s94">For this reason she was fond of seeing great crowds and large stretches of country, of reading about revolutions and wars, of looking at historical pictures--a class of efforts as to which she had often committed the conscious solecism of forgiving them much bad painting for the sake of the subject.</s> <s sid="95" id="portraitone.c4.s95">While the Civil War went on she was still a very young girl; but she passed months of this long period in a state of almost passionate excitement, in which she felt herself at times (to her extreme confusion) stirred almost indiscriminately by the valour of either army.</s> <s sid="96" id="portraitone.c4.s96">Of course the circumspection of suspicious swains had never gone the length of making her a social proscript; for the number of those whose hearts, as they approached her, beat only just fast enough to remind them they had heads as well, had kept her unacquainted with the supreme disciplines of her sex and age.</s> <s sid="97" id="portraitone.c4.s97">She had had everything a girl could have: kindness, admiration, bonbons, bouquets, the sense of exclusion from none of the privileges of the world she lived in, abundant opportunity for dancing, plenty of new dresses, the London _Spectator_, the latest publications, the music of Gounod, the poetry of Browning, the prose of George Eliot.</s> </p>

to have a larger perception of surrounding facts and to care for knowledge that was tinged with the unfamiliar.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraitone.c6.s3">It is true that among her contemporaries she passed for a young woman of extraordinary profundity; for these excellent people never withheld their admiration from a reach of intellect of which they themselves were not conscious, and spoke of Isabel as a prodigy of learning, a creature reported to have read the classic authors--in translations.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraitone.c6.s4">Her paternal aunt, Mrs. Varian, once spread the rumour that Isabel was writing a book--Mrs. Varian having a reverence for books, and averred that the girl would distinguish herself in print.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraitone.c6.s5">Mrs. Varian thought highly of literature, for which she entertained that esteem that is connected with a sense of privation.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraitone.c6.s6">Her own large house, remarkable for its assortment of mosaic tables and decorated ceilings, was unfurnished with a library, and in the way of printed volumes contained nothing but half a dozen novels in paper on a shelf in the apartment of one of the Miss Varians.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraitone.c6.s7">Practically, Mrs. Varian's acquaintance with literature was confined to The New York _Interviewer_;

she only had a general idea that people were right when they treated her as if she were rather superior.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraitone.c6.s11">Whether or no she were superior, people were right in admiring her if they thought her so;

she often surveyed with complacency the field of her own nature; she was in the habit of taking for granted, on scanty evidence, that she was right; she treated herself to occasions of homage.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraitone.c6.s13">Meanwhile her errors and delusions were frequently such as a biographer interested in preserving the dignity of his subject must shrink from specifying.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraitone.c6.s14">Her thoughts were a tangle of vague outlines which had never been corrected by the judgement of people speaking with authority.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraitone.c6.s15">In matters of opinion she had had her own way, and it had led her into a thousand ridiculous zigzags.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraitone.c6.s16">At moments she discovered she was grotesquely wrong, and then she treated herself to a week of passionate humility.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraitone.c6.s17">After this she held her head higher than ever again; for it was of no use, she had an unquenchable desire to think well of herself.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraitone.c6.s18">She had a theory that it was only under this provision life was worth living; that one should be one of the best, should be conscious of a fine organisation (she couldn't help knowing her organisation was fine), should move in a realm of light, of natural wisdom, of happy impulse, of inspiration gracefully chronic.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraitone.c6.s19">It was almost as unnecessary to cultivate doubt of one's self as to cultivate doubt of one's best friend: one should try to be one's own best friend and to give one's self, in this manner, distinguished company.</s> <s sid="20" id="portraitone.c6.s20">The girl had a certain nobleness of imagination which rendered her a good many services and played her a great many tricks.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraitone.c6.s21">She spent half her time in thinking of beauty and bravery and magnanimity; she had a fixed determination to regard the world as a place of brightness, of free expansion, of irresistible action: she held it must be detestable to be afraid or ashamed.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraitone.c6.s22">She had an infinite hope that she should never do anything wrong.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraitone.c6.s23">She had resented so strongly, after discovering them, her mere errors of feeling (the discovery always made her tremble as if she had escaped from a trap which might have caught her and smothered her) that the chance of inflicting a sensible injury upon another person, presented only as a contingency, caused her at moments to hold her breath.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraitone.c6.s24">That always struck her as the worst thing that could happen to her.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraitone.c6.s25">On the whole, reflectively, she was in no uncertainty about the things that were wrong.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraitone.c6.s26">She had no love of their look, but when she fixed them hard she recognised them.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraitone.c6.s27">It was wrong to be mean, to be jealous, to be false, to be cruel; she had seen very little of the evil of the world, but she had seen women who lied and who tried to hurt each other.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraitone.c6.s28">Seeing such things had quickened her high spirit; it seemed indecent not to scorn them.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraitone.c6.s29">Of course the danger of a high spirit was the danger of inconsistency--the danger of keeping up the flag after the place has surrendered; a sort of behaviour so crooked as to be almost a dishonour to the flag.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraitone.c6.s30">But Isabel, who knew little of the sorts of artillery to which young women are exposed, flattered herself that such contradictions would never be noted in her own conduct.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraitone.c6.s31">Her life should always be in harmony with the most pleasing impression she should produce; she would be what she appeared, and she would appear what she was.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraitone.c6.s32">Sometimes she went so far as to wish that she might find herself some day in a difficult position, so that she should have the pleasure of being as heroic as the occasion demanded.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraitone.c6.s33">Altogether, with her meagre knowledge, her inflated ideals, her confidence at once innocent and dogmatic, her temper at once exacting and indulgent, her mixture of curiosity and fastidiousness, of vivacity and indifference, her desire to look very well and to be if possible even better, her determination to see, to try, to know, her combination of the delicate, desultory, flame-like spirit and the eager and personal creature of conditions: she would be an easy victim of scientific criticism if she were not intended to awaken on the reader's part an impulse more tender and more purely expectant.</s> </p>

she thought such descriptions weak, and, besides, her sister Lily constantly urged her to come and abide.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraitone.c6.s36">She had a friend whose acquaintance she had made shortly before her father's death, who offered so high an example of useful activity that Isabel always thought of her as a model.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraitone.c6.s37">Henrietta Stackpole had the advantage of an admired ability;

her cherished desire had long been to come to Europe and write a series of letters to the _Interviewer_ from the radical point of view--an enterprise the less difficult as she knew perfectly in advance what her opinions would be and to how many objections most European institutions lay open.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraitone.c6.s40">When she heard that Isabel was coming she wished to start at once; thinking, naturally, that it would be delightful the two should travel together.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraitone.c6.s41">She had been obliged, however, to postpone this enterprise.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraitone.c6.s42">She thought Isabel a glorious creature, and had spoken of her covertly in some of her letters, though she never mentioned the fact to her friend, who would not have taken pleasure in it and was not a regular student of the _Interviewer_.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraitone.c6.s43">Henrietta, for Isabel, was chiefly a proof that a woman might suffice to herself and be happy.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraitone.c6.s44">Her resources were of the obvious kind; but even if one had not the journalistic talent and a genius for guessing, as Henrietta said, what the public was going to want, one was not therefore to conclude that one had no vocation, no beneficent aptitude of any sort, and resign one's self to being frivolous and hollow.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraitone.c6.s45">Isabel was stoutly determined not to be hollow.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraitone.c6.s46">If one should wait with the right patience one would find some happy work to one's hand.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraitone.c6.s47">Of course, among her theories, this young lady was not without a collection of views on the subject of marriage.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraitone.c6.s48">The first on the list was a conviction of the vulgarity of thinking too much of it.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraitone.c6.s49">From lapsing into eagerness on this point she earnestly prayed she might be delivered; she held that a woman ought to be able to live to herself, in the absence of exceptional flimsiness, and that it was perfectly possible to be happy without the society of a more or less coarse-minded person of another sex.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraitone.c6.s50">The girl's prayer was very sufficiently answered; something pure and proud that there was in her--something cold and dry an unappreciated suitor with a taste for analysis might have called it--had hitherto kept her from any great vanity of conjecture on the article of possible husbands.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraitone.c6.s51">Few of the men she saw seemed worth a ruinous expenditure, and it made her smile to think that one of them should present himself as an incentive to hope and a reward of patience.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraitone.c6.s52">Deep in her soul--it was the deepest thing there--lay a belief that if a certain light should dawn she could give herself completely; but this image, on the whole, was too formidable to be attractive.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraitone.c6.s53">Isabel's thoughts hovered about it, but they seldom rested on it long; after a little it ended in alarms.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraitone.c6.s54">It often seemed to her that she thought too much about herself; you could have made her colour, any day in the year, by calling her a rank egoist.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraitone.c6.s55">She was always planning out her development, desiring her perfection, observing her progress.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraitone.c6.s56">Her nature had, in her conceit, a certain garden-like quality, a suggestion of perfume and murmuring boughs, of shady bowers and lengthening vistas, which made her feel that introspection was, after all, an exercise in the open air, and that a visit to the recesses of one's spirit was harmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraitone.c6.s57">But she was often reminded that there were other gardens in the world than those of her remarkable soul, and that there were moreover a great many places which were not gardens at all--only dusky pestiferous tracts, planted thick with ugliness and misery.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraitone.c6.s58">In the current of that repaid curiosity on which she had lately been floating, which had conveyed her to this beautiful old England and might carry her much further still, she often checked herself with the thought of the thousands of people who were less happy than herself--a thought which for the moment made her fine, full consciousness appear a kind of immodesty.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraitone.c6.s59">What should one do with the misery of the world in a scheme of the agreeable for one's self?</s> <s sid="60" id="portraitone.c6.s60">It must be confessed that this question never held her long.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraitone.c6.s61">She was too young, too impatient to live, too unacquainted with pain.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraitone.c6.s62">She always returned to her theory that a young woman whom after all every one thought clever should begin by getting a general impression of life.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraitone.c6.s63">This impression was necessary to prevent mistakes, and after it should be secured she might make the unfortunate condition of others a subject of special attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="portraitone.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraitone.c7.s1">The two amused themselves, time and again, with talking of the attitude of the British public as if the young lady had been in a position to appeal to it; but in fact the British public remained for the present profoundly indifferent to Miss Isabel Archer, whose fortune had dropped her, as her cousin said, into the dullest house in England.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraitone.c7.s2">Her gouty uncle received very little company, and Mrs. Touchett, not having cultivated relations with her husband's neighbours, was not warranted in expecting visits from them.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraitone.c7.s3">She had, however, a peculiar taste; she liked to receive cards.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraitone.c7.s4">For what is usually called social intercourse she had very little relish; but nothing pleased her more than to find her hall-table whitened with oblong morsels of symbolic pasteboard.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraitone.c7.s5">She flattered herself that she was a very just woman, and had mastered the sovereign truth that nothing in this world is got for nothing.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraitone.c7.s6">She had played no social part as mistress of Gardencourt, and it was not to be supposed that, in the surrounding country, a minute account should be kept of her comings and goings.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraitone.c7.s7">But it is by no means certain that she did not feel it to be wrong that so little notice was taken of them and that her failure (really very gratuitous) to make herself important in the neighbourhood had not much to do with the acrimony of her allusions to her husband's adopted country.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraitone.c7.s8">Isabel presently found herself in the singular situation of defending the British constitution against her aunt; Mrs. Touchett having formed the habit of sticking pins into this venerable instrument.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraitone.c7.s9">Isabel always felt an impulse to pull out the pins; not that she imagined they inflicted any damage on the tough old parchment, but because it seemed to her her aunt might make better use of her sharpness.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraitone.c7.s10">She was very critical herself--it was incidental to her age, her sex and her nationality; but she was very sentimental as well, and there was something in Mrs. Touchett's dryness that set her own moral fountains flowing.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="portraitone.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="portraitone.c7.s11"><qs/>"Now what's your point of view?"<qe/> she asked of her aunt.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraitone.c7.s12"><qs/>"When you criticise everything here you should have a point of view.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraitone.c7.s13">Yours doesn't seem to be American--you thought everything over there so disagreeable.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraitone.c7.s14">When I criticise I have mine; it's thoroughly American!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="portraitone.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="portraitone.c7.s15"><qs/>"My dear young lady,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Touchett, <sse/><qs/>"there are as many points of view in the world as there are people of sense to take them.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraitone.c7.s16">You may say that doesn't make them very numerous!</s> <s sid="17" id="portraitone.c7.s17">American?</s> <s sid="18" id="portraitone.c7.s18">Never in the world; that's shockingly narrow.</s> <s sid="19" id="portraitone.c7.s19">My point of view, thank God, is personal!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraitone.c7.p4" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="portraitone.c7.s20">Isabel thought this a better answer than she admitted; it was a tolerable description of her own manner of judging, but it would not have sounded well for her to say so.</s> <s sid="21" id="portraitone.c7.s21">On the lips of a person less advanced in life and less enlightened by experience than Mrs. Touchett such a declaration would savour of immodesty, even of arrogance.</s> <s sid="22" id="portraitone.c7.s22">She risked it nevertheless in talking with Ralph, with whom she talked a great deal and with whom her conversation was of a sort that gave a large licence to extravagance.</s> <s sid="23" id="portraitone.c7.s23">Her cousin used, as the phrase is, to chaff her; he very soon established with her a reputation for treating everything as a joke, and he was not a man to neglect the privileges such a reputation conferred.</s> <s sid="24" id="portraitone.c7.s24">She accused him of an odious want of seriousness, of laughing at all things, beginning with himself.</s> <s sid="25" id="portraitone.c7.s25">Such slender faculty of reverence as he possessed centred wholly upon his father; for the rest, he exercised his wit indifferently upon his father's son, this gentleman's weak lungs, his useless life, his fantastic mother, his friends (Lord Warburton in especial), his adopted, and his native country, his charming new-found cousin.</s> <s sid="26" id="portraitone.c7.s26"><qs/>"I keep a band of music in my ante-room,"<qe/> he said once to her.</s> <s sid="27" id="portraitone.c7.s27"><qs/>"It has orders to play without stopping; it renders me two excellent services.</s> <s sid="28" id="portraitone.c7.s28">It keeps the sounds of the world from reaching the private apartments, and it makes the world think that dancing's going on within."<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="portraitone.c7.s29">It was dance-music indeed that you usually heard when you came within ear-shot of Ralph's band; the liveliest waltzes seemed to float upon the air.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraitone.c7.s30">Isabel often found herself irritated by this perpetual fiddling; she would have liked to pass through the ante-room, as her cousin called it, and enter the private apartments.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraitone.c7.s31">It mattered little that he had assured her they were a very dismal place; she would have been glad to undertake to sweep them and set them in order.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraitone.c7.s32">It was but half-hospitality to let her remain outside; to punish him for which Isabel administered innumerable taps with the ferule of her straight young wit.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraitone.c7.s33">It must be said that her wit was exercised to a large extent in self-defence, for her cousin amused himself with calling her "Columbia" and accusing her of a patriotism so heated that it scorched.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraitone.c7.s34">He drew a caricature of her in which she was represented as a very pretty young woman dressed, on the lines of the prevailing fashion, in the folds of the national banner.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraitone.c7.s35">Isabel's chief dread in life at this period of her development was that she should appear narrow-minded; what she feared next afterwards was that she should really be so.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraitone.c7.s36">But she nevertheless made no scruple of abounding in her cousin's sense and pretending to sigh for the charms of her native land.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraitone.c7.s37">She would be as American as it pleased him to regard her, and if he chose to laugh at her she would give him plenty of occupation.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraitone.c7.s38">She defended England against his mother, but when Ralph sang its praises on purpose, as she said, to work her up, she found herself able to differ from him on a variety of points.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraitone.c7.s39">In fact, the quality of this small ripe country seemed as sweet to her as the taste of an October pear; and her satisfaction was at the root of the good spirits which enabled her to take her cousin's chaff and return it in kind.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraitone.c7.s40">If her good-humour flagged at moments it was not because she thought herself ill-used, but because she suddenly felt sorry for Ralph.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraitone.c7.s41">It seemed to her he was talking as a blind and had little heart in what he said.</s> <s sid="42" id="portraitone.c7.s42"><qs/>"I don't know what's the matter with you,"<qe/><sls/> she observed to him once; <sle/><qs/>"but I suspect you're a great humbug."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="portraitone.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="portraitone.c7.s43"><qs/>"That's your privilege,"<qe/> Ralph answered, who had not been used to being so crudely addressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="portraitone.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="portraitone.c7.s44"><qs/>"I don't know what you care for; I don't think you care for anything.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraitone.c7.s45">You don't really care for England when you praise it; you don't care for America even when you pretend to abuse it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="portraitone.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="portraitone.c7.s46"><qs/>"I care for nothing but you, dear cousin,"<qe/> said Ralph.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="portraitone.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="portraitone.c7.s47"><qs/>"If I could believe even that, I should be very glad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="portraitone.c7.p9" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="portraitone.c7.s48"><qs/>"Ah well, I should hope so!"<qe/> the young man exclaimed.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="portraitone.c7.p10"><s sid="49" id="portraitone.c7.s49">Isabel might have believed it and not have been far from the truth.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraitone.c7.s50">He thought a great deal about her; she was constantly present to his mind.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraitone.c7.s51">At a time when his thoughts had been a good deal of a burden to him her sudden arrival, which promised nothing and was an open-handed gift of fate, had refreshed and quickened them, given them wings and something to fly for.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraitone.c7.s52">Poor Ralph had been for many weeks steeped in melancholy; his outlook, habitually sombre, lay under the shadow of a deeper cloud.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraitone.c7.s53">He had grown anxious about his father, whose gout, hitherto confined to his legs, had begun to ascend into regions more vital.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraitone.c7.s54">The old man had been gravely ill in the spring, and the doctors had whispered to Ralph that another attack would be less easy to deal with.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraitone.c7.s55">Just now he appeared disburdened of pain, but Ralph could not rid himself of a suspicion that this was a subterfuge of the enemy, who was waiting to take him off his guard.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraitone.c7.s56">If the manoeuvre should succeed there would be little hope of any great resistance.</s> <s sid="57" id="portraitone.c7.s57">Ralph had always taken for granted that his father would survive him--that his own name would be the first grimly called.</s> <s sid="58" id="portraitone.c7.s58">The father and son had been close companions, and the idea of being left alone with the remnant of a tasteless life on his hands was not gratifying to the young man, who had always and tacitly counted upon his elder's help in making the best of a poor business.</s> <s sid="59" id="portraitone.c7.s59">At the prospect of losing his great motive Ralph lost indeed his one inspiration.</s> <s sid="60" id="portraitone.c7.s60">If they might die at the same time it would be all very well; but without the encouragement of his father's society he should barely have patience to await his own turn.</s> <s sid="61" id="portraitone.c7.s61">He had not the incentive of feeling that he was indispensable to his mother; it was a rule with his mother to have no regrets.</s> <s sid="62" id="portraitone.c7.s62">He bethought himself of course that it had been a small kindness to his father to wish that, of the two, the active rather than the passive party should know the felt wound; he remembered that the old man had always treated his own forecast of an early end as a clever fallacy, which he should be delighted to discredit so far as he might by dying first.</s> <s sid="63" id="portraitone.c7.s63">But of the two triumphs, that of refuting a sophistical son and that of holding on a while longer to a state of being which, with all abatements, he enjoyed, Ralph deemed it no sin to hope the latter might be vouchsafed to Mr. Touchett.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="portraitone.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="portraitone.c7.s64">These were nice questions, but Isabel's arrival put a stop to his puzzling over them.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraitone.c7.s65">It even suggested there might be a compensation for the intolerable _ennui_ of surviving his genial sire.</s> <s sid="66" id="portraitone.c7.s66">He wondered whether he were harbouring "love" for this spontaneous young woman from Albany; but he judged that on the whole he was not.</s> <s sid="67" id="portraitone.c7.s67">After he had known her for a week he quite made up his mind to this, and every day he felt a little more sure.</s> <s sid="68" id="portraitone.c7.s68">Lord Warburton had been right about her; she was a really interesting little figure.</s> <s sid="69" id="portraitone.c7.s69">Ralph wondered how their neighbour had found it out so soon; and then he said it was only another proof of his friend's high abilities, which he had always greatly admired.</s> <s sid="70" id="portraitone.c7.s70">If his cousin were to be nothing more than an entertainment to him, Ralph was conscious she was an entertainment of a high order.</s> <s sid="71" id="portraitone.c7.s71"><qs/>"A character like that,"<qe/><sss/> he said to himself--<sse/><qs/>"a real little passionate force to see at play is the finest thing in nature.</s> <s sid="72" id="portraitone.c7.s72">It's finer than the finest work of art--than a Greek bas-relief, than a great Titian, than a Gothic cathedral.</s> <s sid="73" id="portraitone.c7.s73">It's very pleasant to be so well treated where one had least looked for it.</s> <s sid="74" id="portraitone.c7.s74">I had never been more blue, more bored, than for a week before she came; I had never expected less that anything pleasant would happen.</s> <s sid="75" id="portraitone.c7.s75">Suddenly I receive a Titian, by the post, to hang on my wall--a Greek bas-relief to stick over my chimney-piece.</s> <s sid="76" id="portraitone.c7.s76">The key of a beautiful edifice is thrust into my hand, and I'm told to walk in and admire.</s> <s sid="77" id="portraitone.c7.s77">My poor boy, you've been sadly ungrateful, and now you had better keep very quiet and never grumble again."<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="portraitone.c7.s78">The sentiment of these reflexions was very just; but it was not exactly true that Ralph Touchett had had a key put into his hand.</s> <s sid="79" id="portraitone.c7.s79">His cousin was a very brilliant girl, who would take, as he said, a good deal of knowing; but she needed the knowing, and his attitude with regard to her, though it was contemplative and critical, was not judicial.</s> <s sid="80" id="portraitone.c7.s80">He surveyed the edifice from the outside and admired it greatly; he looked in at the windows and received an impression of proportions equally fair.</s> <s sid="81" id="portraitone.c7.s81">But he felt that he saw it only by glimpses and that he had not yet stood under the roof.</s> <s sid="82" id="portraitone.c7.s82">The door was fastened, and though he had keys in his pocket he had a conviction that none of them would fit.</s> <s sid="83" id="portraitone.c7.s83">She was intelligent and generous; it was a fine free nature; but what was she going to do with herself?</s> <s sid="84" id="portraitone.c7.s84">This question was irregular, for with most women one had no occasion to ask it.</s> <s sid="85" id="portraitone.c7.s85">Most women did with themselves nothing at all; they waited, in attitudes more or less gracefully passive, for a man to come that way and furnish them with a destiny.</s> <s sid="86" id="portraitone.c7.s86">Isabel's originality was that she gave one an impression of having intentions of her own.</s> <s sid="87" id="portraitone.c7.s87"><qs/>"Whenever she executes them,"<qe/><sss/> said Ralph, <sse/><qs/>"may I be there to see!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="portraitone.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="portraitone.c7.s88">It devolved upon him of course to do the honours of the place.</s> <s sid="89" id="portraitone.c7.s89">Mr. Touchett was confined to his chair, and his wife's position was that of rather a grim visitor; so that in the line of conduct that opened itself to Ralph duty and inclination were harmoniously mixed.</s> <s sid="90" id="portraitone.c7.s90">He was not a great walker, but he strolled about the grounds with his cousin--a pastime for which the weather remained favourable with a persistency not allowed for in Isabel's somewhat lugubrious prevision of the climate; and in the long afternoons, of which the length was but the measure of her gratified eagerness, they took a boat on the river, the dear little river, as Isabel called it, where the opposite shore seemed still a part of the foreground of the landscape; or drove over the country in a phaeton--a low, capacious, thick-wheeled phaeton formerly much used by Mr. Touchett, but which he had now ceased to enjoy.</s> <s sid="91" id="portraitone.c7.s91">Isabel enjoyed it largely and, handling the reins in a manner which approved itself to the groom as <qs/>"knowing,"<qe/> was never weary of driving her uncle's capital horses through winding lanes and byways full of the rural incidents she had confidently expected to find; past cottages thatched and timbered, past ale-houses latticed and sanded, past patches of ancient common and glimpses of empty parks, between hedgerows made thick by midsummer.</s> <s sid="92" id="portraitone.c7.s92">When they reached home they usually found tea had been served on the lawn and that Mrs. Touchett had not shrunk from the extremity of handing her husband his cup.</s> <s sid="93" id="portraitone.c7.s93">But the two for the most part sat silent; the old man with his head back and his eyes closed, his wife occupied with her knitting and wearing that appearance of rare profundity with which some ladies consider the movement of their needles.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="portraitone.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="portraitone.c7.s94">One day, however, a visitor had arrived.</s> <s sid="95" id="portraitone.c7.s95">The two young persons, after spending an hour on the river, strolled back to the house and perceived Lord Warburton sitting under the trees and engaged in conversation, of which even at a distance the desultory character was appreciable, with Mrs. Touchett.</s> <s sid="96" id="portraitone.c7.s96">He had driven over from his own place with a portmanteau and had asked, as the father and son often invited him to do, for a dinner and a lodging.</s> <s sid="97" id="portraitone.c7.s97">Isabel, seeing him for half an hour on the day of her arrival, had discovered in this brief space that she liked him; he had indeed rather sharply registered himself on her fine sense and she had thought of him several times.</s> <s sid="98" id="portraitone.c7.s98">She had hoped she should see him again--hoped too that she should see a few others.</s> <s sid="99" id="portraitone.c7.s99">Gardencourt was not dull; the place itself was sovereign, her uncle was more and more a sort of golden grandfather, and Ralph was unlike any cousin she had ever encountered--her idea of cousins having tended to gloom.</s> <s sid="100" id="portraitone.c7.s100">Then her impressions were still so fresh and so quickly renewed that there was as yet hardly a hint of vacancy in the view.</s> <s sid="101" id="portraitone.c7.s101">But Isabel had need to remind herself that she was interested in human nature and that her foremost hope in coming abroad had been that she should see a great many people.</s> <s sid="102" id="portraitone.c7.s102">When Ralph said to her, as he had done several times, <qs/>"I wonder you find this endurable; you ought to see some of the neighbours and some of our friends, because we have really got a few, though you would never suppose it"<qe/>--when he offered to invite what he called a "lot of people" and make her acquainted with English society, she encouraged the hospitable impulse and promised in advance to hurl herself into the fray.</s> <s sid="103" id="portraitone.c7.s103">Little, however, for the present, had come of his offers, and it may be confided to the reader that if the young man delayed to carry them out it was because he found the labour of providing for his companion by no means so severe as to require extraneous help.</s> <s sid="104" id="portraitone.c7.s104">Isabel had spoken to him very often about <qs/>"specimens;"<qe/> it was a word that played a considerable part in her vocabulary; she had given him to understand that she wished to see English society illustrated by eminent cases.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="portraitone.c7.p14" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="portraitone.c7.s105"><qs/>"Well now, there's a specimen,"<qe/> he said to her as they walked up from the riverside and he recognised Lord Warburton.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="portraitone.c7.p15" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="portraitone.c7.s106"><qs/>"A specimen of what?"<qe/> asked the girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="portraitone.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="portraitone.c7.s107"><qs/>"A specimen of an English gentleman."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="portraitone.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="portraitone.c7.s108"><qs/>"Do you mean they're all like him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="portraitone.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="portraitone.c7.s109"><qs/>"Oh no; they're not all like him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="portraitone.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="portraitone.c7.s110"><qs/>"He's a favourable specimen then,"<qe/><sss/> said Isabel; <sse/><qs/>"because I'm sure he's nice."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="portraitone.c7.p20" type="speech"><s sid="111" id="portraitone.c7.s111"><qs/>"Yes, he's very nice.</s> <s sid="112" id="portraitone.c7.s112">And he's very fortunate."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="portraitone.c7.p21" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="portraitone.c7.s113">The fortunate Lord Warburton exchanged a handshake with our heroine and hoped she was very well.</s> <s sid="114" id="portraitone.c7.s114"><qs/>"But I needn't ask that,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"since you've been handling the oars."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="portraitone.c7.p22" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="portraitone.c7.s115"><qs/>"I've been rowing a little,"<qe/><sss/> Isabel answered; <sse/><qs/>"but how should you know it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="portraitone.c7.p23" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="portraitone.c7.s116"><qs/>"Oh, I know he doesn't row; he's too lazy,"<qe/> said his lordship, indicating Ralph Touchett with a laugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="portraitone.c7.p24" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="portraitone.c7.s117"><qs/>"He has a good excuse for his laziness,"<qe/> Isabel rejoined, lowering her voice a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="portraitone.c7.p25" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="portraitone.c7.s118"><qs/>"Ah, he has a good excuse for everything!"<qe/> cried Lord Warburton, still with his sonorous mirth.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="portraitone.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="portraitone.c7.s119"><qs/>"My excuse for not rowing is that my cousin rows so well,"<qe/> said Ralph.</s> <s sid="120" id="portraitone.c7.s120"><qs/>"She does everything well.</s> <s sid="121" id="portraitone.c7.s121">She touches nothing that she doesn't adorn!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="portraitone.c7.p27" type="speech"><s sid="122" id="portraitone.c7.s122"><qs/>"It makes one want to be touched, Miss Archer,"<qe/> Lord Warburton declared.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="portraitone.c7.p28" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="portraitone.c7.s123"><qs/>"Be touched in the right sense and you'll never look the worse for it,"<qe/> said Isabel, who, if it pleased her to hear it said that her accomplishments were numerous, was happily able to reflect that such complacency was not the indication of a feeble mind, inasmuch as there were several things in which she excelled.</s> <s sid="124" id="portraitone.c7.s124">Her desire to think well of herself had at least the element of humility that it always needed to be supported by proof.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="portraitone.c7.p29" type="speech"><s sid="125" id="portraitone.c7.s125">Lord Warburton not only spent the night at Gardencourt, but he was persuaded to remain over the second day; and when the second day was ended he determined to postpone his departure till the morrow.</s> <s sid="126" id="portraitone.c7.s126">During this period he addressed many of his remarks to Isabel, who accepted this evidence of his esteem with a very good grace.</s> <s sid="127" id="portraitone.c7.s127">She found herself liking him extremely; the first impression he had made on her had had weight, but at the end of an evening spent in his society she scarce fell short of seeing him--though quite without luridity--as a hero of romance.</s> <s sid="128" id="portraitone.c7.s128">She retired to rest with a sense of good fortune, with a quickened consciousness of possible felicities.</s> <s sid="129" id="portraitone.c7.s129"><qs/>"It's very nice to know two such charming people as those,"<qe/> she said, meaning by "those" her cousin and her cousin's friend.</s> <s sid="130" id="portraitone.c7.s130">It must be added moreover that an incident had occurred which might have seemed to put her good-humour to the test.</s> <s sid="131" id="portraitone.c7.s131">Mr. Touchett went to bed at half-past nine o'clock, but his wife remained in the drawing-room with the other members of the party.</s> <s sid="132" id="portraitone.c7.s132">She prolonged her vigil for something less than an hour, and then, rising, observed to Isabel that it was time they should bid the gentlemen good-night.</s> <s sid="133" id="portraitone.c7.s133">Isabel had as yet no desire to go to bed; the occasion wore, to her sense, a festive character, and feasts were not in the habit of terminating so early.</s> <s sid="134" id="portraitone.c7.s134">So, without further thought, she replied, very simply--</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="portraitone.c14.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraitone.c14.s1">Miss Stackpole would have prepared to start immediately; but Isabel, as we have seen, had been notified that Lord Warburton would come again to Gardencourt, and she believed it her duty to remain there and see him.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraitone.c14.s2">For four or five days he had made no response to her letter; then he had written, very briefly, to say he would come to luncheon two days later.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraitone.c14.s3">There was something in these delays and postponements that touched the girl and renewed her sense of his desire to be considerate and patient, not to appear to urge her too grossly; a consideration the more studied that she was so sure he "really liked" her.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraitone.c14.s4">Isabel told her uncle she had written to him, mentioning also his intention of coming; and the old man, in consequence, left his room earlier than usual and made his appearance at the two o'clock repast.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraitone.c14.s5">This was by no means an act of vigilance on his part, but the fruit of a benevolent belief that his being of the company might help to cover any conjoined straying away in case Isabel should give their noble visitor another hearing.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraitone.c14.s6">That personage drove over from Lockleigh and brought the elder of his sisters with him, a measure presumably dictated by reflexions of the same order as Mr. Touchett's.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraitone.c14.s7">The two visitors were introduced to Miss Stackpole, who, at luncheon, occupied a seat adjoining Lord Warburton's.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraitone.c14.s8">Isabel, who was nervous and had no relish for the prospect of again arguing the question he had so prematurely opened, could not help admiring his good-humoured self-possession, which quite disguised the symptoms of that preoccupation with her presence it was natural she should suppose him to feel.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraitone.c14.s9">He neither looked at her nor spoke to her, and the only sign of his emotion was that he avoided meeting her eyes.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraitone.c14.s10">He had plenty of talk for the others, however, and he appeared to eat his luncheon with discrimination and appetite.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraitone.c14.s11">Miss Molyneux, who had a smooth, nun-like forehead and wore a large silver cross suspended from her neck, was evidently preoccupied with Henrietta Stackpole, upon whom her eyes constantly rested in a manner suggesting a conflict between deep alienation and yearning wonder.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraitone.c14.s12">Of the two ladies from Lockleigh she was the one Isabel had liked best; there was such a world of hereditary quiet in her.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraitone.c14.s13">Isabel was sure moreover that her mild forehead and silver cross referred to some weird Anglican mystery--some delightful reinstitution perhaps of the quaint office of the canoness.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraitone.c14.s14">She wondered what Miss Molyneux would think of her if she knew Miss Archer had refused her brother; and then she felt sure that Miss Molyneux would never know--that Lord Warburton never told her such things.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraitone.c14.s15">He was fond of her and kind to her, but on the whole he told her little.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraitone.c14.s16">Such, at least, was Isabel's theory; when, at table, she was not occupied in conversation she was usually occupied in forming theories about her neighbours.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraitone.c14.s17">According to Isabel, if Miss Molyneux should ever learn what had passed between Miss Archer and Lord Warburton she would probably be shocked at such a girl's failure to rise; or no, rather (this was our heroine's last position) she would impute to the young American but a due consciousness of inequality.</s> </p>

she used to abound in the sense of Isabel's irony and to enumerate with elation the hours she had spent with this perfect man of the world--a term that had ceased to make with her, as previously, for opprobrium.</s> <s sid="248" id="portraitone.c20.s248">Then, a few moments later, she would forget that they had been talking jocosely and would mention with impulsive earnestness some expedition she had enjoyed in his company.</s> <s sid="249" id="portraitone.c20.s249">She would say:</s> <s sid="250" id="portraitone.c20.s250"><qs/>"Oh, I know all about Versailles;

<p pid="1" id="portraitone.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="portraitone.c22.s1">On one of the first days of May, some six months after old Mr. Touchett's death, a small group that might have been described by a painter as composing well was gathered in one of the many rooms of an ancient villa crowning an olive-muffled hill outside of the Roman gate of Florence.</s> <s sid="2" id="portraitone.c22.s2">The villa was a long, rather blank-looking structure, with the far-projecting roof which Tuscany loves and which, on the hills that encircle Florence, when considered from a distance, makes so harmonious a rectangle with the straight, dark, definite cypresses that usually rise in groups of three or four beside it.</s> <s sid="3" id="portraitone.c22.s3">The house had a front upon a little grassy, empty, rural piazza which occupied a part of the hill-top; and this front, pierced with a few windows in irregular relations and furnished with a stone bench lengthily adjusted to the base of the structure and useful as a lounging-place to one or two persons wearing more or less of that air of undervalued merit which in Italy, for some reason or other, always gracefully invests any one who confidently assumes a perfectly passive attitude--this antique, solid, weather-worn, yet imposing front had a somewhat incommunicative character.</s> <s sid="4" id="portraitone.c22.s4">It was the mask, not the face of the house.</s> <s sid="5" id="portraitone.c22.s5">It had heavy lids, but no eyes; the house in reality looked another way--looked off behind, into splendid openness and the range of the afternoon light.</s> <s sid="6" id="portraitone.c22.s6">In that quarter the villa overhung the slope of its hill and the long valley of the Arno, hazy with Italian colour.</s> <s sid="7" id="portraitone.c22.s7">It had a narrow garden, in the manner of a terrace, productive chiefly of tangles of wild roses and other old stone benches, mossy and sun-warmed.</s> <s sid="8" id="portraitone.c22.s8">The parapet of the terrace was just the height to lean upon, and beneath it the ground declined into the vagueness of olive-crops and vineyards.</s> <s sid="9" id="portraitone.c22.s9">It is not, however, with the outside of the place that we are concerned; on this bright morning of ripened spring its tenants had reason to prefer the shady side of the wall.</s> <s sid="10" id="portraitone.c22.s10">The windows of the ground-floor, as you saw them from the piazza, were, in their noble proportions, extremely architectural; but their function seemed less to offer communication with the world than to defy the world to look in.</s> <s sid="11" id="portraitone.c22.s11">They were massively cross-barred, and placed at such a height that curiosity, even on tiptoe, expired before it reached them.</s> <s sid="12" id="portraitone.c22.s12">In an apartment lighted by a row of three of these jealous apertures--one of the several distinct apartments into which the villa was divided and which were mainly occupied by foreigners of random race long resident in Florence--a gentleman was seated in company with a young girl and two good sisters from a religious house.</s> <s sid="13" id="portraitone.c22.s13">The room was, however, less sombre than our indications may have represented, for it had a wide, high door, which now stood open into the tangled garden behind; and the tall iron lattices admitted on occasion more than enough of the Italian sunshine.</s> <s sid="14" id="portraitone.c22.s14">It was moreover a seat of ease, indeed of luxury, telling of arrangements subtly studied and refinements frankly proclaimed, and containing a variety of those faded hangings of damask and tapestry, those chests and cabinets of carved and time-polished oak, those angular specimens of pictorial art in frames as pedantically primitive, those perverse-looking relics of medieval brass and pottery, of which Italy has long been the not quite exhausted storehouse.</s> <s sid="15" id="portraitone.c22.s15">These things kept terms with articles of modern furniture in which large allowance had been made for a lounging generation; it was to be noticed that all the chairs were deep and well padded and that much space was occupied by a writing-table of which the ingenious perfection bore the stamp of London and the nineteenth century.</s> <s sid="16" id="portraitone.c22.s16">There were books in profusion and magazines and newspapers, and a few small, odd, elaborate pictures, chiefly in water-colour.</s> <s sid="17" id="portraitone.c22.s17">One of these productions stood on a drawing-room easel before which, at the moment we begin to be concerned with her, the young girl I have mentioned had placed herself.</s> <s sid="18" id="portraitone.c22.s18">She was looking at the picture in silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="portraitone.c23.p4"><s sid="28" id="portraitone.c23.s28">This was a note of cynicism that Madame Merle didn't often allow herself to sound; but Isabel was not alarmed, for she had never supposed that as one saw more of the world the sentiment of respect became the most active of one's emotions.</s> <s sid="29" id="portraitone.c23.s29">It was excited, none the less, by the beautiful city of Florence, which pleased her not less than Madame Merle had promised; and if her unassisted perception had not been able to gauge its charms she had clever companions as priests to the mystery.</s> <s sid="30" id="portraitone.c23.s30">She was--in no want indeed of esthetic illumination, for Ralph found it a joy that renewed his own early passion to act as cicerone to his eager young kinswoman.</s> <s sid="31" id="portraitone.c23.s31">Madame Merle remained at home; she had seen the treasures of Florence again and again and had always something else to do.</s> <s sid="32" id="portraitone.c23.s32">But she talked of all things with remarkable vividness of memory--she recalled the right-hand corner of the large Perugino and the position of the hands of the Saint Elizabeth in the picture next to it.</s> <s sid="33" id="portraitone.c23.s33">She had her opinions as to the character of many famous works of art, differing often from Ralph with great sharpness and defending her interpretations with as much ingenuity as good-humour.</s> <s sid="34" id="portraitone.c23.s34">Isabel listened to the discussions taking place between the two with a sense that she might derive much benefit from them and that they were among the advantages she couldn't have enjoyed for instance in Albany.</s> <s sid="35" id="portraitone.c23.s35">In the clear May mornings before the formal breakfast--this repast at Mrs. Touchett's was served at twelve o'clock--she wandered with her cousin through the narrow and sombre Florentine streets, resting a while in the thicker dusk of some historic church or the vaulted chambers of some dispeopled convent.</s> <s sid="36" id="portraitone.c23.s36">She went to the galleries and palaces; she looked at the pictures and statues that had hitherto been great names to her, and exchanged for a knowledge which was sometimes a limitation a presentiment which proved usually to have been a blank.</s> <s sid="37" id="portraitone.c23.s37">She performed all those acts of mental prostration in which, on a first visit to Italy, youth and enthusiasm so freely indulge; she felt her heart beat in the presence of immortal genius and knew the sweetness of rising tears in eyes to which faded fresco and darkened marble grew dim.</s> <s sid="38" id="portraitone.c23.s38">But the return, every day, was even pleasanter than the going forth; the return into the wide, monumental court of the great house in which Mrs. Touchett, many years before, had established herself, and into the high, cool rooms where the carven rafters and pompous frescoes of the sixteenth century looked down on the familiar commodities of the age of advertisement.</s> <s sid="39" id="portraitone.c23.s39">Mrs. Touchett inhabited an historic building in a narrow street whose very name recalled the strife of medieval factions; and found compensation for the darkness of her frontage in the modicity of her rent and the brightness of a garden where nature itself looked as archaic as the rugged architecture of the palace and which cleared and scented the rooms in regular use.</s> <s sid="40" id="portraitone.c23.s40">To live in such a place was, for Isabel, to hold to her ear all day a shell of the sea of the past.</s> <s sid="41" id="portraitone.c23.s41">This vague eternal rumour kept her imagination awake.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="portraitone.c23.p5"><s sid="42" id="portraitone.c23.s42">Gilbert Osmond came to see Madame Merle, who presented him to the young lady lurking at the other side of the room.</s> <s sid="43" id="portraitone.c23.s43">Isabel took on this occasion little part in the talk; she scarcely even smiled when the others turned to her invitingly; she sat there as if she had been at the play and had paid even a large sum for her place.</s> <s sid="44" id="portraitone.c23.s44">Mrs. Touchett was not present, and these two had it, for the effect of brilliancy, all their own way.</s> <s sid="45" id="portraitone.c23.s45">They talked of the Florentine, the Roman, the cosmopolite world, and might have been distinguished performers figuring for a charity.</s> <s sid="46" id="portraitone.c23.s46">It all had the rich readiness that would have come from rehearsal.</s> <s sid="47" id="portraitone.c23.s47">Madame Merle appealed to her as if she had been on the stage, but she could ignore any learnt cue without spoiling the scene--though of course she thus put dreadfully in the wrong the friend who had told Mr. Osmond she could be depended on.</s> <s sid="48" id="portraitone.c23.s48">This was no matter for once; even if more had been involved she could have made no attempt to shine.</s> <s sid="49" id="portraitone.c23.s49">There was something in the visitor that checked her and held her in suspense--made it more important she should get an impression of him than that she should produce one herself.</s> <s sid="50" id="portraitone.c23.s50">Besides, she had little skill in producing an impression which she knew to be expected: nothing could be happier, in general, than to seem dazzling, but she had a perverse unwillingness to glitter by arrangement.</s> <s sid="51" id="portraitone.c23.s51">Mr. Osmond, to do him justice, had a well-bred air of expecting nothing, a quiet ease that covered everything, even the first show of his own wit.</s> <s sid="52" id="portraitone.c23.s52">This was the more grateful as his face, his head, was sensitive; he was not handsome, but he was fine, as fine as one of the drawings in the long gallery above the bridge of the Uffizi.</s> <s sid="53" id="portraitone.c23.s53">And his very voice was fine--the more strangely that, with its clearness, it yet somehow wasn't sweet.</s> <s sid="54" id="portraitone.c23.s54">This had had really to do with making her abstain from interference.</s> <s sid="55" id="portraitone.c23.s55">His utterance was the vibration of glass, and if she had put out her finger she might have changed the pitch and spoiled the concert.</s> <s sid="56" id="portraitone.c23.s56">Yet before he went she had to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="portraitone.c23.p7"><s sid="63" id="portraitone.c23.s63">Isabel replied that she should be delighted to see Miss Osmond and that if Madame Merle would show her the way to the hill-top she should be very grateful.</s> <s sid="64" id="portraitone.c23.s64">Upon this assurance the visitor took his leave; after which Isabel fully expected her friend would scold her for having been so stupid.</s> <s sid="65" id="portraitone.c23.s65">But to her surprise that lady, who indeed never fell into the mere matter-of-course, said to her in a few moments,</s> </p>

this perhaps would be the best course so long as she remained in Florence.</s> <s sid="118" id="portraitone.c26.s118">One must be fair and not make arbitrary differences: the Countess had doubtless been imprudent, she had not been so clever as other women.</s> <s sid="119" id="portraitone.c26.s119">She was a good creature, not clever at all;

though, to do him justice, one would suppose it had been by a more sensible woman than the American Corinne, as Mrs. Osmond had liked to be called.</s> <s sid="133" id="portraitone.c26.s133">She had brought her children to Italy after her husband's death, and Mrs. Touchett remembered her during the year that followed her arrival.</s> <s sid="134" id="portraitone.c26.s134">She thought her a horrible snob; but this was an irregularity of judgement on Mrs. Touchett's part, for she, like Mrs. Osmond, approved of political marriages.</s> <s sid="135" id="portraitone.c26.s135">The Countess was very good company and not really the featherhead she seemed;

how much she should like to know Miss Archer; how thankful she should be for a real friend; how base the people in Florence were; how tired she was of the place; how much she should like to live somewhere else--in Paris, in London, in Washington; how impossible it was to get anything nice to wear in Italy except a little old lace; how dear the world was growing everywhere; what a life of suffering and privation she had led.</s> <s sid="142" id="portraitone.c26.s142">Madame Merle listened with interest to Isabel's account of this passage, but she had not needed it to feel exempt from anxiety.</s> <s sid="143" id="portraitone.c26.s143">On the whole she was not afraid of the Countess, and she could afford to do what was altogether best--not to appear so.</s> </p>
