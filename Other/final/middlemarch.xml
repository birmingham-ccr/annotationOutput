<p pid="1" id="middlemarch.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="middlemarch.c1.s1">Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors?</s> <s sid="2" id="middlemarch.c1.s2">Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve.</s> <s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c1.s3">That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning.</s> <s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c1.s4">Theresa's passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her?</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c1.s5">Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c1.s6">She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c1.p2"><s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c1.s7">That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not the last of her kind.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c1.s8">Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c1.s9">With dim lights and tangled circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c1.s10">Their ardor alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c1.p3"><s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c1.s11">Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with scientific certitude.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c1.s12">Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure and the favorite love-stories in prose and verse.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c1.s13">Here and there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c1.s14">Here and there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>BOOK I. MISS BROOKE. CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="middlemarch.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="middlemarch.c2.s1">"Since I can do no good because a woman, Reach constantly at something that is near it.</s> <s sid="2" id="middlemarch.c2.s2">--The Maid's Tragedy:</s> <s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c2.s3">BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c2.s4">Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c2.s5">Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,--or from one of our elder poets,--in a paragraph of to-day's newspaper.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c2.s6">She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c2.s7">Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from her sister's, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss Brooke's plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister shared.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c2.s8">The pride of being ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably <qs/>"good:"<qe/> if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers--anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family estate.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c2.s9">Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster's daughter.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c2.s10">Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank.</s> <s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c2.s11">Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke's case, religion alone would have determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister's sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c2.s12">Dorothea knew many passages of Pascal's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c2.s13">She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c2.s14">Her mind was theoretic, and yearned by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it.</s> <s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c2.s15">Certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection.</s> <s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c2.s16">With all this, she, the elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their orphaned condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c2.p3"><s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c2.s17">It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c2.s18">He had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind.</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c2.s19">Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as possible in carrying them out.</s> <s sid="20" id="middlemarch.c2.s20">For the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c2.p4"><s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c2.s21">In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle's talk or his way of "letting things be" on his estate, and making her long all the more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of money for generous schemes.</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c2.s22">She was regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke's estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year--a rental which seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel's late conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of genteel life.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c2.p5"><s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c2.s23">And how should Dorothea not marry?--a girl so handsome and with such prospects?</s> <s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c2.s24">Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers.</s> <s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c2.s25">A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the time of the Apostles--who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old theological books!</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c2.s26">Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such fellowship.</s> <s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c2.s27">Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on.</s> <s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c2.s28">Sane people did what their neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid them.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c2.p6"><s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c2.s29">The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers, was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke's large eyes seemed, like her religion, too unusual and striking.</s> <s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c2.s30">Poor Dorothea! compared with her, the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of blazonry or clock-face for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c2.p7"><s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c2.s31">Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with it.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c2.s32">Most men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c2.s33">She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c2.s34">Riding was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to renouncing it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c2.p8"><s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c2.s35">She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c2.s36">Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from Celia's point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for Celia to accept him.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c2.s37">That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance.</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c2.s38">Dorothea, with all her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about marriage.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c2.s39">She felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome baronet, who said "Exactly" to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty,--how could he affect her as a lover?</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c2.s40">The really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c2.p9"><s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c2.s41">These peculiarities of Dorothea's character caused Mr. Brooke to be all the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces.</s> <s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c2.s42">But he himself dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea's objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world--that is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector's wife, and the small group of gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire.</s> <s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c2.s43">So Miss Brooke presided in her uncle's household, and did not at all dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="middlemarch.c2.p10"><s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c2.s44">Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt some venerating expectation.</s> <s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c2.s45">This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon, noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication of his book.</s> <s sid="46" id="middlemarch.c2.s46">His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="middlemarch.c2.p11"><s sid="47" id="middlemarch.c2.s47">Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to propose something, said--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="middlemarch.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="middlemarch.c2.s48"><qs/>"Dorothea, dear, if you don't mind--if you are not very busy--suppose we looked at mamma's jewels to-day, and divided them?</s> <s sid="49" id="middlemarch.c2.s49">It is exactly six months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at them yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="middlemarch.c2.p13"><s sid="50" id="middlemarch.c2.s50">Celia's face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious electricity if you touched them incautiously.</s> <s sid="51" id="middlemarch.c2.s51">To her relief, Dorothea's eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="middlemarch.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="middlemarch.c2.s52"><qs/>"What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia!</s> <s sid="53" id="middlemarch.c2.s53">Is it six calendar or six lunar months?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c2.s57"><qs/>"Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know."<qe/></s> <s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c2.s58">Dorothea spoke in a full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory.</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c2.s59">She had her pencil in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c2.s60">Celia colored, and looked very grave.</s> <s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c2.s61"><qs/>"I think, dear, we are wanting in respect to mamma's memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.</s> <s sid="62" id="middlemarch.c2.s62">And,"<qe/><sls/> she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of mortification, <sle/><qs/>"necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.</s> <s sid="63" id="middlemarch.c2.s63">And Christians generally--surely there are women in heaven now who wore jewels."<qe/></s> <s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c2.s64">Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really applied herself to argument.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="middlemarch.c2.s65"><qs/>"You would like to wear them?"<qe/> exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments.</s> <s sid="66" id="middlemarch.c2.s66"><qs/>"Of course, then, let us have them out.</s> <s sid="67" id="middlemarch.c2.s67">Why did you not tell me before?</s> <s sid="68" id="middlemarch.c2.s68">But the keys, the keys!"<qe/></s> <s sid="69" id="middlemarch.c2.s69">She pressed her hands against the sides of her head and seemed to despair of her memory.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="middlemarch.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="middlemarch.c2.s70"><qs/>"They are here,"<qe/> said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long meditated and prearranged.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="middlemarch.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="middlemarch.c2.s71"><qs/>"Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="middlemarch.c2.p21"><s sid="72" id="middlemarch.c2.s72">The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread out, making a bright parterre on the table.</s> <s sid="73" id="middlemarch.c2.s73">It was no great collection, but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.</s> <s sid="74" id="middlemarch.c2.s74">Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her sister's neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia's head and neck, and she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="middlemarch.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="middlemarch.c2.s75"><qs/>"There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin.</s> <s sid="76" id="middlemarch.c2.s76">But this cross you must wear with your dark dresses."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="middlemarch.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="middlemarch.c2.s79"><qs/>"No, no, dear, no,"<qe/> said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless deprecation.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="middlemarch.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="middlemarch.c2.s80"><qs/>"Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you--in your black dress, now,"<qe/> said Celia, insistingly.</s> <s sid="81" id="middlemarch.c2.s81"><qs/>"You _might_ wear that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c8.p2"><s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c8.s3">Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned to the progress of his great work--the Key to all Mythologies--naturally made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of courtship.</s> <s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c8.s4">But he had deliberately incurred the hindrance, having made up his mind that it was now time for him to adorn his life with the graces of female companionship, to irradiate the gloom which fatigue was apt to hang over the intervals of studious labor with the play of female fancy, and to secure in this, his culminating age, the solace of female tendance for his declining years.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c8.s5">Hence he determined to abandon himself to the stream of feeling, and perhaps was surprised to find what an exceedingly shallow rill it was.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c8.s6">As in droughty regions baptism by immersion could only be performed symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found that sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream would afford him; and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated the force of masculine passion.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c8.s7">Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure that Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c8.s8">It had once or twice crossed his mind that possibly there was some deficiency in Dorothea to account for the moderation of his abandonment; but he was unable to discern the deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who would have pleased him better; so that there was clearly no reason to fall back upon but the exaggerations of human tradition.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c8.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c8.s9"><qs/>"Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?"<qe/><sls/> said Dorothea to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; <sle/><qs/>"could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton's daughters did to their father, without understanding what they read?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c8.s10"><qs/>"I fear that would be wearisome to you,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Casaubon, smiling; <sse/><qs/>"and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion against the poet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c8.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c8.s11"><qs/>"Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c8.s12">I hope you don't expect me to be naughty and stupid?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c8.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c8.s13"><qs/>"I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every possible relation of life.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c8.s14">Certainly it might be a great advantage if you were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it were well to begin with a little reading."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c8.p7"><s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c8.s15">Dorothea seized this as a precious permission.</s> <s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c8.s16">She would not have asked Mr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages, dreading of all things to be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely out of devotion to her future husband that she wished to know Latin and Greek.</s> <s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c8.s17">Those provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her a standing-ground from which all truth could be seen more truly.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c8.s18">As it was, she constantly doubted her own conclusions, because she felt her own ignorance: how could she be confident that one-roomed cottages were not for the glory of God, when men who knew the classics appeared to conciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory?</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c8.s19">Perhaps even Hebrew might be necessary--at least the alphabet and a few roots--in order to arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on the social duties of the Christian.</s> <s sid="20" id="middlemarch.c8.s20">And she had not reached that point of renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a wise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself.</s> <s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c8.s21">Miss Brooke was certainly very naive with all her alleged cleverness.</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c8.s22">Celia, whose mind had never been thought too powerful, saw the emptiness of other people's pretensions much more readily.</s> <s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c8.s23">To have in general but little feeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any particular occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c8.p8"><s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c8.s24">However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour together, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover, to whom a mistress's elementary ignorance and difficulties have a touching fitness.</s> <s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c8.s25">Few scholars would have disliked teaching the alphabet under such circumstances.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c8.s26">But Dorothea herself was a little shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got to some timid questions about the value of the Greek accents gave her a painful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable of explanation to a woman's reason.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c8.p9"><s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c8.s27">Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with his usual strength upon it one day that he came into the library while the reading was going forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="middlemarch.c8.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c8.s28"><qs/>"Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics, that kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman--too taxing, you know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="middlemarch.c8.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c8.s29"><qs/>"Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,"<qe/> said Mr. Casaubon, evading the question.</s> <s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c8.s30"><qs/>"She had the very considerate thought of saving my eyes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="middlemarch.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c8.s31"><qs/>"Ah, well, without understanding, you know--that may not be so bad.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c8.s32">But there is a lightness about the feminine mind--a touch and go--music, the fine arts, that kind of thing--they should study those up to a certain point, women should; but in a light way, you know.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c8.s33">A woman should be able to sit down and play you or sing you a good old English tune.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c8.s34">That is what I like; though I have heard most things--been at the opera in Vienna:</s> <s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c8.s35">Gluck, Mozart, everything of that sort.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c8.s36">But I'm a conservative in music--it's not like ideas, you know.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c8.s37">I stick to the good old tunes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="middlemarch.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c8.s38"><qs/>"Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he is not,"<qe/> said Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and feminine fine art must be forgiven her, considering the small tinkling and smearing in which they chiefly consisted at that dark period.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c8.s39">She smiled and looked up at her betrothed with grateful eyes.</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c8.s40">If he had always been asking her to play the <qs/>"Last Rose of Summer,"<qe/> she would have required much resignation.</s> <s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c8.s41"><qs/>"He says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick, and it is covered with books."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="middlemarch.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c8.s42"><qs/>"Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear.</s> <s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c8.s43">Celia, now, plays very prettily, and is always ready to play.</s> <s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c8.s44">However, since Casaubon does not like it, you are all right.</s> <s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c8.s45">But it's a pity you should not have little recreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung--that kind of thing, you know--will not do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="middlemarch.c8.p15" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="middlemarch.c8.s46"><qs/>"I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears teased with measured noises,"<qe/> said Mr. Casaubon.</s> <s sid="47" id="middlemarch.c8.s47"><qs/>"A tune much iterated has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort of minuet to keep time--an effect hardly tolerable, I imagine, after boyhood.</s> <s sid="48" id="middlemarch.c8.s48">As to the grander forms of music, worthy to accompany solemn celebrations, and even to serve as an educating influence according to the ancient conception, I say nothing, for with these we are not immediately concerned."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c8.p16" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="middlemarch.c8.s49"><qs/>"No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,"<qe/> said Dorothea.</s> <s sid="50" id="middlemarch.c8.s50"><qs/>"When we were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ at Freiberg, and it made me sob."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="middlemarch.c8.s51"><qs/>"That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,"<qe/> said Mr. Brooke.</s> <s sid="52" id="middlemarch.c8.s52"><qs/>"Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c8.p18"><s sid="53" id="middlemarch.c8.s53">He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really thinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to so sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="middlemarch.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="middlemarch.c8.s54"><qs/>"It is wonderful, though,"<qe/><sls/> he said to himself as he shuffled out of the room--<sle/><qs/>"it is wonderful that she should have liked him.</s> <s sid="55" id="middlemarch.c8.s55">However, the match is good.</s> <s sid="56" id="middlemarch.c8.s56">I should have been travelling out of my brief to have hindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will.</s> <s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c8.s57">He is pretty certain to be a bishop, is Casaubon.</s> <s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c8.s58">That was a very seasonable pamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:--a deanery at least.</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c8.s59">They owe him a deanery."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="middlemarch.c8.p20"><s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c8.s60">And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness, by remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the Radical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make on the incomes of the bishops.</s> <s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c8.s61">What elegant historian would neglect a striking opportunity for pointing out that his heroes did not foresee the history of the world, or even their own actions?--For example, that Henry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a Catholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he measured his laborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen measuring their idle days with watches.</s> <s sid="62" id="middlemarch.c8.s62">Here is a mine of truth, which, however vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="middlemarch.c8.p21"><s sid="63" id="middlemarch.c8.s63">But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by precedent--namely, that if he had foreknown his speech, it might not have made any great difference.</s> <s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c8.s64">To think with pleasure of his niece's husband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thing--to make a Liberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c9.p2"><s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c9.s4">It was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to like going to the Grange after he had once encountered the difficulty of seeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was engaged to another man.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c9.s5">Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass through him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it must be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if he had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c9.s6">He had no sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost some of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c9.p3"><s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c9.s7">Nevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he had completely resigned her, since with the perversity of a Desdemona she had not affected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to nature; he could not yet be quite passive under the idea of her engagement to Mr. Casaubon.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c9.s8">On the day when he first saw them together in the light of his present knowledge, it seemed to him that he had not taken the affair seriously enough.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c9.s9">Brooke was really culpable; he ought to have hindered it.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c9.s10">Who could speak to him?</s> <s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c9.s11">Something might be done perhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c9.s12">On his way home he turned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c9.s13">Happily, the Rector was at home, and his visitor was shown into the study, where all the fishing tackle hung.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c9.s14">But he himself was in a little room adjoining, at work with his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to join him there.</s> <s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c9.s15">The two were better friends than any other landholder and clergyman in the county--a significant fact which was in agreement with the amiable expression of their faces.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c11.p2"><s sid="2" id="middlemarch.c11.s2">Young Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited him, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his young relative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness to waive inquiry.</s> <s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c11.s3">Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise destination than the entire area of Europe.</s> <s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c11.s4">Genius, he held, is necessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the utmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await those messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work, only placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime chances.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c11.s5">The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had sincerely tried many of them.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c11.s6">He was not excessively fond of wine, but he had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that form of ecstasy; he had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on lobster; he had made himself ill with doses of opium.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c11.s7">Nothing greatly original had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium had convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his constitution and De Quincey's.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c11.s8">The superadded circumstance which would evolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c11.s9">Even Caesar's fortune at one time was, but a grand presentiment.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c11.s10">We know what a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes may be disguised in helpless embryos.--In fact, the world is full of hopeful analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities.</s> <s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c11.s11">Will saw clearly enough the pitiable instances of long incubation producing no chick, and but for gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose plodding application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned theory exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a moral entirely encouraging to Will's generous reliance on the intentions of the universe with regard to himself.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c11.s12">He held that reliance to be a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the contrary; genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility, but in a power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in particular.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c11.s13">Let him start for the Continent, then, without our pronouncing on his future.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c11.s14">Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the most gratuitous.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c11.p3" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c11.s15">But at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me more in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his young cousin.</s> <s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c11.s16">If to Dorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight the fine inflammable material of her youthful illusions, does it follow that he was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him?</s> <s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c11.s17">I protest against any absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from Mrs. Cadwallader's contempt for a neighboring clergyman's alleged greatness of soul, or Sir James Chettam's poor opinion of his rival's legs,--from Mr. Brooke's failure to elicit a companion's ideas, or from Celia's criticism of a middle-aged scholar's personal appearance.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c11.s18">I am not sure that the greatest man of his age, if ever that solitary superlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of himself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c11.s19">Moreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has rather a chilling rhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or fine feeling in him.</s> <s sid="20" id="middlemarch.c11.s20">Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of hieroglyphs write detestable verses?</s> <s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c11.s21">Has the theory of the solar system been advanced by graceful manners and conversational tact?</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c11.s22">Suppose we turn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener interest, what is the report of his own consciousness about his doings or capacity: with what hindrances he is carrying on his daily labors; what fading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years are marking off within him; and with what spirit he wrestles against universal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him, and bring his heart to its final pause.</s> <s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c11.s23">Doubtless his lot is important in his own eyes; and the chief reason that we think he asks too large a place in our consideration must be our want of room for him, since we refer him to the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is even held sublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there, however little he may have got from us.</s> <s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c11.s24">Mr. Casaubon, too, was the centre of his own world; if he was liable to think that others were providentially made for him, and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness for the author of a <qs/>"Key to all Mythologies,"<qe/> this trait is not quite alien to us, and, like the other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims some of our pity.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c11.p4"><s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c11.s25">Certainly this affair of his marriage with Miss Brooke touched him more nearly than it did any one of the persons who have hitherto shown their disapproval of it, and in the present stage of things I feel more tenderly towards his experience of success than towards the disappointment of the amiable Sir James.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c11.s26">For in truth, as the day fixed for his marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his spirits rising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden scene, where, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him than the accustomed vaults where he walked taper in hand.</s> <s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c11.s27">He did not confess to himself, still less could he have breathed to another, his surprise that though he had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he had not won delight,--which he had also regarded as an object to be found by search.</s> <s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c11.s28">It is true that he knew all the classical passages implying the contrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of motion, which explains why they leave so little extra force for their personal application.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c11.p5"><s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c11.s29">Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long studious bachelorhood had stored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large drafts on his affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally on the strength of them.</s> <s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c11.s30">And now he was in danger of being saddened by the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually happy: there was nothing external by which he could account for a certain blankness of sensibility which came over him just when his expectant gladness should have been most lively, just when he exchanged the accustomed dulness of his Lowick library for his visits to the Grange.</s> <s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c11.s31">Here was a weary experience in which he was as utterly condemned to loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened him while toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to the goal.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c11.s32">And his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from sympathy.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c11.s33">He could not but wish that Dorothea should think him not less happy than the world would expect her successful suitor to be; and in relation to his authorship he leaned on her young trust and veneration, he liked to draw forth her fresh interest in listening, as a means of encouragement to himself: in talking to her he presented all his performance and intention with the reflected confidence of the pedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience which crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure of Tartarean shades.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c11.p6"><s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c11.s34">For to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted to young ladies which had made the chief part of her education, Mr. Casaubon's talk about his great book was full of new vistas; and this sense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to Stoics and Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike her own, kept in abeyance for the time her usual eagerness for a binding theory which could bring her own life and doctrine into strict connection with that amazing past, and give the remotest sources of knowledge some bearing on her actions.</s> <s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c11.s35">That more complete teaching would come--Mr. Casaubon would tell her all that: she was looking forward to higher initiation in ideas, as she was looking forward to marriage, and blending her dim conceptions of both.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c11.s36">It would be a great mistake to suppose that Dorothea would have cared about any share in Mr. Casaubon's learning as mere accomplishment; for though opinion in the neighborhood of Freshitt and Tipton had pronounced her clever, that epithet would not have described her to circles in whose more precise vocabulary cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing, apart from character.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c11.s37">All her eagerness for acquirement lay within that full current of sympathetic motive in which her ideas and impulses were habitually swept along.</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c11.s38">She did not want to deck herself with knowledge--to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her action; and if she had written a book she must have done it as Saint Theresa did, under the command of an authority that constrained her conscience.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c11.s39">But something she yearned for by which her life might be filled with action at once rational and ardent; and since the time was gone by for guiding visions and spiritual directors, since prayer heightened yearning but not instruction, what lamp was there but knowledge?</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c11.s40">Surely learned men kept the only oil; and who more learned than Mr. Casaubon?</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c11.p7"><s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c11.s41">Thus in these brief weeks Dorothea's joyous grateful expectation was unbroken, and however her lover might occasionally be conscious of flatness, he could never refer it to any slackening of her affectionate interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c11.p8"><s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c11.s42">The season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending the wedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious for this because he wished to inspect some manuscripts in the Vatican.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c11.p9" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c11.s43"><qs/>"I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us,"<qe/> he said one morning, some time after it had been ascertained that Celia objected to go, and that Dorothea did not wish for her companionship.</s> <s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c11.s44"><qs/>"You will have many lonely hours, Dorothea, for I shall be constrained to make the utmost use of my time during our stay in Rome, and I should feel more at liberty if you had a companion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="middlemarch.c11.p10"><s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c11.s45">The words "I should feel more at liberty" grated on Dorothea.</s> <s sid="46" id="middlemarch.c11.s46">For the first time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she colored from annoyance.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="middlemarch.c11.p11" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="middlemarch.c11.s47"><qs/>"You must have misunderstood me very much,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"if you think I should not enter into the value of your time--if you think that I should not willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to the best purpose."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="middlemarch.c11.p12" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="middlemarch.c11.s48"><qs/>"That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Casaubon, not in the least noticing that she was hurt; <sle/><qs/>"but if you had a lady as your companion, I could put you both under the care of a cicerone, and we could thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="middlemarch.c11.p13" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="middlemarch.c11.s49"><qs/>"I beg you will not refer to this again,"<qe/> said Dorothea, rather haughtily.</s> <s sid="50" id="middlemarch.c11.s50">But immediately she feared that she was wrong, and turning towards him she laid her hand on his, adding in a different tone, <qs/>"Pray do not be anxious about me.</s> <s sid="51" id="middlemarch.c11.s51">I shall have so much to think of when I am alone.</s> <s sid="52" id="middlemarch.c11.s52">And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion, just to take care of me.</s> <s sid="53" id="middlemarch.c11.s53">I could not bear to have Celia: she would be miserable."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="middlemarch.c11.p14"><s sid="54" id="middlemarch.c11.s54">It was time to dress.</s> <s sid="55" id="middlemarch.c11.s55">There was to be a dinner-party that day, the last of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper preliminaries to the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once on the sound of the bell, as if she needed more than her usual amount of preparation.</s> <s sid="56" id="middlemarch.c11.s56">She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she could not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be untruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her.</s> <s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c11.s57">Mr. Casaubon's words had been quite reasonable, yet they had brought a vague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="middlemarch.c11.p15" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c11.s58"><qs/>"Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,"<qe/> she said to herself.</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c11.s59"><qs/>"How can I have a husband who is so much above me without knowing that he needs me less than I need him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c11.p16"><s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c11.s60">Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she recovered her equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene dignity when she came into the drawing-room in her silver-gray dress--the simple lines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all search after mere effect.</s> <s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c11.s61">Sometimes when Dorothea was in company, there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking out from her tower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude made the energy of her speech and emotion the more remarked when some outward appeal had touched her.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c11.p17"><s sid="62" id="middlemarch.c11.s62">She was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for the dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male portion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke's nieces had resided with him, so that the talking was done in duos and trios more or less inharmonious.</s> <s sid="63" id="middlemarch.c11.s63">There was the newly elected mayor of Middlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic banker his brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that some called him a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the resources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.</s> <s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c11.s64">In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the Middlemarchers, and that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner, who drank her health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their grandfathers' furniture.</s> <s sid="65" id="middlemarch.c11.s65">For in that part of the country, before reform had done its notable part in developing the political consciousness, there was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of parties; so that Mr. Brooke's miscellaneous invitations seemed to belong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel and habit of taking too much in the form of ideas.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c11.p18" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="middlemarch.c11.s66">Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was found for some interjectional <qs/>"asides."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="middlemarch.c11.p19" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="middlemarch.c11.s67"><qs/>"A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!"<qe/> said Mr. Standish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned with the landed gentry that he had become landed himself, and used that oath in a deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the speech of a man who held a good position.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="middlemarch.c11.p20"><s sid="68" id="middlemarch.c11.s68">Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman disliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed.</s> <s sid="69" id="middlemarch.c11.s69">The remark was taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of a distinguished appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="middlemarch.c11.p21" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="middlemarch.c11.s70"><qs/>"Yes, but not my style of woman:</s> <s sid="71" id="middlemarch.c11.s71">I like a woman who lays herself out a little more to please us.</s> <s sid="72" id="middlemarch.c11.s72">There should be a little filigree about a woman--something of the coquette.</s> <s sid="73" id="middlemarch.c11.s73">A man likes a sort of challenge.</s> <s sid="74" id="middlemarch.c11.s74">The more of a dead set she makes at you the better."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="middlemarch.c11.p22" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="middlemarch.c11.s75"><qs/>"There's some truth in that,"<qe/> said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.</s> <s sid="76" id="middlemarch.c11.s76"><qs/>"And, by God, it's usually the way with them.</s> <s sid="77" id="middlemarch.c11.s77">I suppose it answers some wise ends:</s> <s sid="78" id="middlemarch.c11.s78">Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="middlemarch.c11.p23" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="middlemarch.c11.s79"><qs/>"I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,"<qe/> said Mr. Bulstrode.</s> <s sid="80" id="middlemarch.c11.s80"><qs/>"I should rather refer it to the devil."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="middlemarch.c11.p24" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="middlemarch.c11.s81"><qs/>"Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,"<qe/> said Mr. Chichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been detrimental to his theology.</s> <s sid="82" id="middlemarch.c11.s82"><qs/>"And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a swan neck.</s> <s sid="83" id="middlemarch.c11.s83">Between ourselves, the mayor's daughter is more to my taste than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either.</s> <s sid="84" id="middlemarch.c11.s84">If I were a marrying man I should choose Miss Vincy before either of them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="middlemarch.c11.p25" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="middlemarch.c11.s85"><qs/>"Well, make up, make up,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Standish, jocosely; <sse/><qs/>"you see the middle-aged fellows early the day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="middlemarch.c11.p26"><s sid="86" id="middlemarch.c11.s86">Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he would choose.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="middlemarch.c11.p27"><s sid="87" id="middlemarch.c11.s87">The Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely's ideal was of course not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go too far, would not have chosen that his nieces should meet the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public occasion.</s> <s sid="88" id="middlemarch.c11.s88">The feminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs. Cadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel's widow, was not only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on the ground of her complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed clearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need the supplement of quackery.</s> <s sid="89" id="middlemarch.c11.s89">Lady Chettam, who attributed her own remarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical attendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs. Renfrew's account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her case of all strengthening medicines.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="middlemarch.c11.p28" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="middlemarch.c11.s90"><qs/>"Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?"<qe/> said the mild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively, when Mrs. Renfrew's attention was called away.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="middlemarch.c11.p29" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="middlemarch.c11.s91"><qs/>"It strengthens the disease,"<qe/> said the Rector's wife, much too well-born not to be an amateur in medicine.</s> <s sid="92" id="middlemarch.c11.s92"><qs/>"Everything depends on the constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile--that's my view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the mill."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="middlemarch.c11.p30" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="middlemarch.c11.s93"><qs/>"Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce--reduce the disease, you know, if you are right, my dear.</s> <s sid="94" id="middlemarch.c11.s94">And I think what you say is reasonable."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c30.p3"><s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c30.s11">And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more than he demanded: she might really be such a helpmate to him as would enable him to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr. Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c30.s12">(Mr.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c30.s13">Casaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a powerful mind.)</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c30.s14">Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the wife he needed.</s> <s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c30.s15">A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely appreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her husband's mind powerful.</s> <s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c30.s16">Whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to him.</s> <s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c30.s17">Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c30.s18">As if a man could choose not only his wife but his wife's husband!</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c30.s19">Or as if he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own person!--  When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only natural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to begin.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c30.p5"><s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c30.s32">To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we have seen, he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness that the new bliss was not blissful to him.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c30.s33">Inclination yearned back to its old, easier custom.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c30.s34">And the deeper he went in domesticity the more did the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety predominate over any other satisfaction.</s> <s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c30.s35">Marriage, like religion and erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward requirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all requirements.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c30.s36">Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study, according to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he was always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it might never have begun.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c30.s37">But she had succeeded in making it a matter of course that she should take her place at an early hour in the library and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her.</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c30.s38">The work had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby certain assertions of Warburton's could be corrected.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c30.s39">References were extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity.</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c30.s40">These minor monumental productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain.</s> <s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c30.s41">And from the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a dedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal kingdom among the viros nullo aevo perituros, a mistake which would infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c30.p6"><s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c30.s42">Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to say a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where he had breakfasted alone.</s> <s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c30.s43">Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c31.p9"><s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c31.s39">He asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he was going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from their struggle with the March wind.</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c31.s40">When Lydgate begged to speak with her alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the nearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to say about Mr. Casaubon.</s> <s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c31.s41">It was the first time she had entered this room since her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to open the shutters.</s> <s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c31.s42">But there was light enough to read by from the narrow upper panes of the windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="middlemarch.c31.p15" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="middlemarch.c31.s55"><qs/>"Sit down,"<qe/> she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and throwing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of formality where a great question of destiny was concerned.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c31.p17" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c31.s60">Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a low voice, <qs/>"You mean if we are very careful."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c31.p18" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c31.s61"><qs/>"Yes--careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against excessive application."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="middlemarch.c31.p21"><s sid="68" id="middlemarch.c31.s68">There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she had been turned to marble, though the life within her was so intense that her mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of scenes and motives.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="middlemarch.c31.p29"><s sid="83" id="middlemarch.c31.s83">Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time, unclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her.</s> <s sid="84" id="middlemarch.c31.s84">He was bowing and quitting her, when an impulse which if she had been alone would have turned into a prayer, made her say with a sob in her voice--</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="middlemarch.c31.p31"><s sid="91" id="middlemarch.c31.s91">For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him by this involuntary appeal--this cry from soul to soul, without other consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same embroiled medium, the same troublous fitfully illuminated life.</s> <s sid="92" id="middlemarch.c31.s92">But what could he say now except that he should see Mr. Casaubon again to-morrow?</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="middlemarch.c31.p32"><s sid="93" id="middlemarch.c31.s93">When he was gone, Dorothea's tears gushed forth, and relieved her stifling oppression.</s> <s sid="94" id="middlemarch.c31.s94">Then she dried her eyes, reminded that her distress must not be betrayed to her husband; and looked round the room thinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual, since Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter.</s> <s sid="95" id="middlemarch.c31.s95">On his writing-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the morning when he was taken ill, and among them, as Dorothea well remembered, there were young Ladislaw's letters, the one addressed to her still unopened.</s> <s sid="96" id="middlemarch.c31.s96">The associations of these letters had been made the more painful by that sudden attack of illness which she felt that the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on: it would be time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her, and she had had no inclination to fetch them from the library.</s> <s sid="97" id="middlemarch.c31.s97">But now it occurred to her that they should be put out of her husband's sight: whatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them, he must, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she ran her eyes first over the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="middlemarch.c31.p33" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="middlemarch.c31.s98">Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his obligations to Mr. Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent.</s> <s sid="99" id="middlemarch.c31.s99">It was plain that if he were not grateful, he must be the poorest-spirited rascal who had ever found a generous friend.</s> <s sid="100" id="middlemarch.c31.s100">To expand in wordy thanks would be like saying, <qs/>"I am honest."<qe/></s> <s sid="101" id="middlemarch.c31.s101">But Will had come to perceive that his defects--defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed to--needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his relative's generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable.</s> <s sid="102" id="middlemarch.c31.s102">He trusted that he should make the best return, if return were possible, by showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was indebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards himself of funds on which others might have a better claim.</s> <s sid="103" id="middlemarch.c31.s103">He was coming to England, to try his fortune, as many other young men were obliged to do whose only capital was in their brains.</s> <s sid="104" id="middlemarch.c31.s104">His friend Naumann had desired him to take charge of the <qs/>"Dispute"<qe/>--the picture painted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon's, Will would convey it to Lowick in person.</s> <s sid="105" id="middlemarch.c31.s105">A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him, if necessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment.</s> <s sid="106" id="middlemarch.c31.s106">He enclosed a letter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art, begun with her in Rome.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="middlemarch.c31.p34"><s sid="107" id="middlemarch.c31.s107">Opening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation of his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy neutral delight in things as they were--an outpouring of his young vivacity which it was impossible to read just now.</s> <s sid="108" id="middlemarch.c31.s108">She had immediately to consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still time perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick.</s> <s sid="109" id="middlemarch.c31.s109">Dorothea ended by giving the letter to her uncle, who was still in the house, and begging him to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his health would not allow the reception of any visitors.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="middlemarch.c31.p35"><s sid="110" id="middlemarch.c31.s110">No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his only difficulty was to write a short one, and his ideas in this case expanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings.</s> <s sid="111" id="middlemarch.c31.s111">He had simply said to Dorothea--</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="middlemarch.c31.p36" type="speech"><s sid="112" id="middlemarch.c31.s112"><qs/>"To be sure, I will write, my dear.</s> <s sid="113" id="middlemarch.c31.s113">He's a very clever young fellow--this young Ladislaw--I dare say will be a rising young man.</s> <s sid="114" id="middlemarch.c31.s114">It's a good letter--marks his sense of things, you know.</s> <s sid="115" id="middlemarch.c31.s115">However, I will tell him about Casaubon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="middlemarch.c31.p37" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="middlemarch.c31.s116">But the end of Mr. Brooke's pen was a thinking organ, evolving sentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his mind could well overtake them.</s> <s sid="117" id="middlemarch.c31.s117">It expressed regrets and proposed remedies, which, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously worded--surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he had never before thought of.</s> <s sid="118" id="middlemarch.c31.s118">In this case, his pen found it such a pity young Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that time, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully, and that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings together--it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting in life with a stock of ideas--that by the end of the second page it had persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be received at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange.</s> <s sid="119" id="middlemarch.c31.s119">Why not?</s> <s sid="120" id="middlemarch.c31.s120">They could find a great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar growth--the political horizon was expanding, and--in short, Mr. Brooke's pen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that imperfectly edited organ the <qs/>"Middlemarch Pioneer."<qe/></s> <s sid="121" id="middlemarch.c31.s121">While Mr. Brooke was sealing this letter, he felt elated with an influx of dim projects:--a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the "Pioneer" purchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents utilized--who knew what might come of it all?</s> <s sid="122" id="middlemarch.c31.s122">Since Celia was going to marry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at table with him, at least for a time.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="middlemarch.c31.p38"><s sid="123" id="middlemarch.c31.s123">But he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the letter, for she was engaged with her husband, and--in fact, these things were of no importance to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c33.p4"><s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c33.s21">Thus Stone Court continually saw one or other blood-relation alighting or departing, and Mary Garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their messages to Mr. Featherstone, who would see none of them, and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so.</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c33.s22">As manager of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat; but she chose to consult Mrs. Vincy on the point of extra down-stairs consumption now that Mr. Featherstone was laid up.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="middlemarch.c46.p1"><s sid="1" id="middlemarch.c46.s1">It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their forefathers, and declaim against the wickedness of times present.</s> <s sid="2" id="middlemarch.c46.s2">Which notwithstanding they cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help and satire of times past; condemning the vices of their own times, by the expressions of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but argue the community of vice in both.</s> <s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c46.s3">Horace, therefore, Juvenal, and Persius, were no prophets, although their lines did seem to indigitate and point at our times.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE:</s> <s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c46.s4">Pseudodoxia Epidemica.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c46.p2"><s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c46.s5">That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different lights.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c46.s6">He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded prejudice.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c46.s7">Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that vital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay representative--a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of human action.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c46.s8">These might be called the ministerial views.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c46.s9">But oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw forever on the vasts of ignorance.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c46.s10">What the opposition in Middlemarch said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody shall not be an originator; but there were differences which represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr. Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c46.p3"><s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c46.s11">Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration, that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your leave or with your leave; for it was a known "fac" that he had wanted to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street, who had money in trust before her marriage--a poor tale for a doctor, who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you were gone.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c46.s12">If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was; but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with their pitch-plaisters--such a hanging business as that was not wanted in Middlemarch!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c46.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c46.s13">And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic public-house--the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop's--was the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to the vote whether its long-standing medical man, <qs/>"Doctor Gambit,"<qe/><sls/> should not be cashiered in favor of <sle/><qs/>"this Doctor Lydgate,"<qe/> who was capable of performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether given up by other practitioners.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c46.s14">But the balance had been turned against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors.</s> <s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c46.s15">In the course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop's was an index.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c46.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c46.s16">A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of Lydgate's skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided, depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence.</s> <s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c46.s17">Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare, like old Featherstone's, had been at once inclined to try him; also, many who did not like paying their doctor's bills, thought agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint if the children's temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c46.s18">Some considered that he might do more than others <qs/>"where there was liver;"<qe/>--at least there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of "stuff" from him, since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the yellowness.</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c46.s19">But these were people of minor importance.</s> <s sid="20" id="middlemarch.c46.s20">Good Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting that he was <qs/>"not likely to be equal to Peacock."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c46.p6" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c46.s21">But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden, like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a note of exclamation at the end.</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c46.s22">The cubic feet of oxygen yearly swallowed by a full-grown man--what a shudder they might have created in some Middlemarch circles!</s> <s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c46.s23"><qs/>"Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be--is it any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic?</s> <s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c46.s24">And yet there are people who say quarantine is no good!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c46.p7"><s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c46.s25">One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense drugs.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c46.s26">This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with whom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have counted on having the law on their side against a man who without calling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a charge on drugs.</s> <s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c46.s27">But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one of his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c46.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c46.s28"><qs/>"It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost as mischievous as quacks,"<qe/> said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly.</s> <s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c46.s29"><qs/>"To get their own bread they must overdose the king's lieges; and that's a bad sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey--undermines the constitution in a fatal way."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c46.p9"><s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c46.s30">Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of view, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid, and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging kind--jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence from letting out the full force of his mind.</s> <s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c46.s31">It was Mr. Mawmsey's friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of Lydgate's reply.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c46.s32">But let the wise be warned against too great readiness at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="middlemarch.c46.p10" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c46.s33">Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had known who the king's lieges were, giving his <qs/>"Good morning, sir, good-morning, sir,"<qe/> with the air of one who saw everything clearly enough.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c46.s34">But in truth his views were perturbed.</s> <s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c46.s35">For years he had been paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and eighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c46.s36">He had done this with satisfaction, including it among his responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill than usual as a dignity worth mentioning.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c46.s37">Moreover, in addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to <qs/>"self and family,"<qe/> he had enjoyed the pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit--a practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="middlemarch.c46.p11"><s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c46.s38">Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as a fertile mother,--generally under attendance more or less frequent from Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="middlemarch.c46.p20" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c46.s64">Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer's without fear of rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own honesty, and that it might be worth some people's while to show him up.</s> <s sid="65" id="middlemarch.c46.s65">Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments to a balance.</s> <s sid="66" id="middlemarch.c46.s66">And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate up until he knew how.</s> <s sid="67" id="middlemarch.c46.s67">He had not indeed great resources of education, and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional contempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the breathing apparatus <qs/>"longs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c61.p2"><s sid="3" id="middlemarch.c61.s3">A few days afterwards--it was already the end of August--there was an occasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it chose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished auspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind, belonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq.</s> <s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c61.s4">This was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr. Larcher's great success in the carrying business, which warranted his purchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by an illustrious Spa physician--furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c61.s5">Hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without reserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c61.p3"><s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c61.s6">At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c61.s7">There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a superior funeral; and facilities were offered for that generous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles.</s> <s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c61.s8">Mr. Larcher's sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode's retired residence, known as the Shrubs.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c61.s9">In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all classes with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the races.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c61.s10">The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold, "everybody" was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St.</s> <s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c61.s11">Peter's, had looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and had rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c61.s12">There was a wreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with desk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow-window opening on to the lawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c61.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c61.s13">"Everybody" that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c61.s14">But Mrs. Bulstrode had particularly wished to have a certain picture--a <qs/>"Supper at Emmaus,"<qe/><sls/> attributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the <sle/><qs/>"Pioneer,"<qe/><sls/> of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr. Ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the value of this particular painting--<sle/><qs/>"if,"<qe/><sls/> added the scrupulously polite banker, <sle/><qs/>"attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c61.p6"><s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c61.s24">Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property.</s> <s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c61.s25">Like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion--that there was anything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c61.s26">When he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive, watching for something which he had to dart upon.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c61.p7"><s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c61.s27">This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast.</s> <s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c61.s28">He was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an adventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante--who sneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing.</s> <s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c61.s29">He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c61.p8" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c61.s30">And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge.</s> <s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c61.s31">Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to <qs/>"Berghems;"<qe/> but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins; he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c61.p9"><s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c61.s32">Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher's drawing-room furniture was enough for him.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c61.s33">When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer's enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c61.s34">The fender was of polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c64.p16"><s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c64.s33">Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs.</s> <s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c64.s34">And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller's, the Vicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c64.p17" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c64.s35">The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy's, where, on New Year's Day, there was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c64.s36">And this party was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had persuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being their particular friend.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c64.s37">Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits, though his enjoyment was of a checkered kind--triumph that his mother should see Mary's importance with the chief personages in the party being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c64.s38">Fred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the days when he had not begun to dread being <qs/>"bowled out by Farebrother,"<qe/> and this terror was still before him.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c64.s39">Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest matronly bloom, looked at Mary's little figure, rough wavy hair, and visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying unsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary's appearance in wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would "feature" the Garths.</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c64.s40">However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was particularly bright; being glad, for Fred's sake, that his friends were getting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should see how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be judges.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c64.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c64.s41">Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy spoke as little as possible to his son-in-law.</s> <s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c64.s42">Rosamond was perfectly graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence of that interest in her husband's presence which a loving wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him.</s> <s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c64.s43">When Lydgate was taking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the room, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers.</s> <s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c64.s44">In reality, however, she was intensely aware of Lydgate's voice and movements; and her pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation by which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise of propriety.</s> <s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c64.s45">When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate had been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond happened to be near her, said--<qs/>"You have to give up a great deal of your husband's society, Mrs. Lydgate."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c67.p9"><s sid="56" id="middlemarch.c67.s56">But the last thing likely to have entered Fred's expectation was that he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate--of whom he had never quite dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious of his superiority--looking excited and betting, just as he himself might have done.</s> <s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c67.s57">Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his father had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into the play was suddenly checked.</s> <s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c67.s58">It was a strange reversal of attitudes:</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c67.s59">Fred's blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement, looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal with fierce eyes and retractile claws.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c69.p2"><s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c69.s7">That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him by some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of Mr. Larcher's sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c69.p3"><s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c69.s8">His certainty that Raffles, unless he were dead, would return to Middlemarch before long, had been justified.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c69.s9">On Christmas Eve he had reappeared at The Shrubs.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c69.s10">Bulstrode was at home to receive him, and hinder his communication with the rest of the family, but he could not altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising himself and alarming his wife.</s> <s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c69.s11">Raffles proved more unmanageable than he had shown himself to be in his former appearances, his chronic state of mental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance, quickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him.</s> <s sid="12" id="middlemarch.c69.s12">He insisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of evils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his going into the town.</s> <s sid="13" id="middlemarch.c69.s13">He kept him in his own room for the evening and saw him to bed, Raffles all the while amusing himself with the annoyance he was causing this decent and highly prosperous fellow-sinner, an amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy with his friend's pleasure in entertaining a man who had been serviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings.</s> <s sid="14" id="middlemarch.c69.s14">There was a cunning calculation under this noisy joking--a cool resolve to extract something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this new application of torture.</s> <s sid="15" id="middlemarch.c69.s15">But his cunning had a little overcast its mark.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c69.p4"><s sid="16" id="middlemarch.c69.s16">Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles could enable him to imagine.</s> <s sid="17" id="middlemarch.c69.s17">He had told his wife that he was simply taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might otherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him to this care, and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged caution.</s> <s sid="18" id="middlemarch.c69.s18">He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next morning.</s> <s sid="19" id="middlemarch.c69.s19">In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode with precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and accounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even with food and drink.</s> <s sid="20" id="middlemarch.c69.s20">But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts--lest Mrs. Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door.</s> <s sid="21" id="middlemarch.c69.s21">How could he hinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?</s> <s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c69.s22">She was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was stronger than the calculation of probabilities.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c69.p5"><s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c69.s23">In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an effect which had not been in his plan.</s> <s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c69.s24">By showing himself hopelessly unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the only resource left.</s> <s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c69.s25">After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker ordered his closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next morning.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c69.s26">At six o'clock he had already been long dressed, and had spent some of his wretchedness in prayer, pleading his motives for averting the worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was not true before God.</s> <s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c69.s27">For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an intensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds.</s> <s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c69.s28">But many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring about the end that we fix our mind on and desire.</s> <s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c69.s29">And it is only what we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by Omniscience.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="middlemarch.c69.p6"><s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c69.s30">Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was apparently in a painful dream.</s> <s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c69.s31">He stood silent, hoping that the presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and gently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden awakening.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c69.s32">He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him in terror, trembling and gasping.</s> <s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c69.s33">But he made no further noise, and Bulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his recovery.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="middlemarch.c69.p7" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c69.s34">It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, <qs/>"I came to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a coach."<qe/></s> <s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c69.s35">Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him imperiously with the words, <qs/>"Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to say.</s> <s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c69.s36">I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a reasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter; but if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you will have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without help from me.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c69.s37">Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name:</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c69.s38">I know the worst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust yourself upon me again.</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c69.s39">Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without noise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and you may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you shall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="middlemarch.c69.p8"><s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c69.s40">Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy: he had been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a large part of the night; and though he did not trust to its ultimately saving him from any return of Raffles, he had concluded that it was the best throw he could make.</s> <s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c69.s41">It succeeded in enforcing submission from the jaded man this morning: his empoisoned system at this moment quailed before Bulstrode's cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly in the carriage before the family breakfast time.</s> <s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c69.s42">The servants imagined him to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man like their master, who held his head high in the world, should be ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him.</s> <s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c69.s43">The banker's drive of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good reason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds.</s> <s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c69.s44">Various motives urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire closely into all of them.</s> <s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c69.s45">As he had stood watching Raffles in his uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="middlemarch.c69.p9"><s sid="46" id="middlemarch.c69.s46">He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the fact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to the risks of defying him.</s> <s sid="47" id="middlemarch.c69.s47">But when, freed from his repulsive presence, Bulstrode returned to his quiet home, he brought with him no confidence that he had secured more than a respite.</s> <s sid="48" id="middlemarch.c69.s48">It was as if he had had a loathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful kindred of sensations--as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his life a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="middlemarch.c69.p10"><s sid="49" id="middlemarch.c69.s49">Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the thoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of opinion is threatened with ruin?</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="middlemarch.c69.p11"><s sid="50" id="middlemarch.c69.s50">Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of uneasy presentiment in his wife's mind, because she carefully avoided any allusion to it.</s> <s sid="51" id="middlemarch.c69.s51">He had been used every day to taste the flavor of supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some discreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to edification.</s> <s sid="52" id="middlemarch.c69.s52">Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode's anxious temperament, is often worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the anguish of an imminent disgrace.</s> <s sid="53" id="middlemarch.c69.s53">Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of Raffles did not keep the man away--and though he prayed for this result he hardly hoped for it--the disgrace was certain.</s> <s sid="54" id="middlemarch.c69.s54">In vain he said to himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a chastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should escape dishonor.</s> <s sid="55" id="middlemarch.c69.s55">That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations for quitting Middlemarch.</s> <s sid="56" id="middlemarch.c69.s56">If evil truth must be reported of him, he would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old neighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be less formidable.</s> <s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c69.s57">To leave the place finally would, he knew, be extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have preferred to stay where he had struck root.</s> <s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c69.s58">Hence he made his preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all sides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable intervention of Providence should dissipate his fears.</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c69.s59">He was preparing to transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground of his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of such work.</s> <s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c69.s60">The measure would cause him some added expense and some diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="middlemarch.c69.p12"><s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c69.s61">This was the experience which had determined his conversation with Lydgate.</s> <s sid="62" id="middlemarch.c69.s62">But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be unnecessary.</s> <s sid="63" id="middlemarch.c69.s63">He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of his fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty--especially since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would like to live.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="middlemarch.c69.p13"><s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c69.s64">Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the farm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on all other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or about Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth.</s> <s sid="65" id="middlemarch.c69.s65">Like every one else who had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more anxious for his employer's interests than his own.</s> <s sid="66" id="middlemarch.c69.s66">With regard to Stone Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to have an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="middlemarch.c69.p15" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="middlemarch.c69.s69"><qs/>"I'll think about it,"<qe/> said Caleb, in his blunt way.</s> <s sid="70" id="middlemarch.c69.s70"><qs/>"I'll see how I can make it out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c69.p16"><s sid="71" id="middlemarch.c69.s71">If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy's future, Mr. Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.</s> <s sid="72" id="middlemarch.c69.s72">But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea occurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court.</s> <s sid="73" id="middlemarch.c69.s73">What if Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the management?</s> <s sid="74" id="middlemarch.c69.s74">It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by helping in other business.</s> <s sid="75" id="middlemarch.c69.s75">He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with such evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by expressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c72.p17"><s sid="67" id="middlemarch.c72.s67">But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the smell of fire.</s> <s sid="68" id="middlemarch.c72.s68">Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel.</s> <s sid="69" id="middlemarch.c72.s69">In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles.</s> <s sid="70" id="middlemarch.c72.s70">Caleb was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the last week.</s> <s sid="71" id="middlemarch.c72.s71">Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Raffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode's affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller.</s> <s sid="72" id="middlemarch.c72.s72">The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be the chief publisher of Bulstrode's misdemeanors.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c72.p18" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="middlemarch.c72.s73">Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances of his death.</s> <s sid="74" id="middlemarch.c72.s74">He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might look at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr. Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly secret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he had always had justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into conclusions.</s> <s sid="75" id="middlemarch.c72.s75">But while they were talking another combination was silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother's mind, which foreshadowed what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary <qs/>"putting of two and two together."<qe/></s> <s sid="76" id="middlemarch.c72.s76">With the reasons which kept Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread might have something to do with his munificence towards his medical man; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate's reputation.</s> <s sid="77" id="middlemarch.c72.s77">He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the sudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from all approaches towards the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="middlemarch.c72.p19" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="middlemarch.c72.s78"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sls/> he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable discussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally proven, <sle/><qs/>"it is a strange story.</s> <s sid="79" id="middlemarch.c72.s79">So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer genealogy!</s> <s sid="80" id="middlemarch.c72.s80">A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made a likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have suspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker.</s> <s sid="81" id="middlemarch.c72.s81">However, there's no knowing what a mixture will turn out beforehand.</s> <s sid="82" id="middlemarch.c72.s82">Some sorts of dirt serve to clarify."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="middlemarch.c72.p23"><s sid="88" id="middlemarch.c72.s88">Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate's attendance on Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of Bulstrode.</s> <s sid="89" id="middlemarch.c72.s89">But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and comments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a significant relation between this sudden command of money and Bulstrode's desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles.</s> <s sid="90" id="middlemarch.c72.s90">That the money came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there had been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into the gossip about Lydgate's affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor his own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs. Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who mentioned it generally.</s> <s sid="91" id="middlemarch.c72.s91">The business was felt to be so public and important that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took their work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop's, gathered a zest which could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out the Reform Bill.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="middlemarch.c81.p2"><s sid="4" id="middlemarch.c81.s4">When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she had promised to go and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt.</s> <s sid="5" id="middlemarch.c81.s5">There was a frequent interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother family, which enabled her to say that she was not at all lonely at the Manor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady companion.</s> <s sid="6" id="middlemarch.c81.s6">When she reached home and remembered her engagement, she was glad of it; and finding that she had still an hour before she could dress for dinner, she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell, giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and getting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy.</s> <s sid="7" id="middlemarch.c81.s7">She paused on her way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some garden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the result of sixty years' experience as to soils--namely, that if your soil was pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make it all of a mummy, why then--</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="middlemarch.c81.p3"><s sid="8" id="middlemarch.c81.s8">Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being rather late, she dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than was necessary.</s> <s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c81.s9">That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like another White of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of his inarticulate guests and proteges, whom he was teaching the boys not to torment; and he had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets of the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c81.s10">The evening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than usual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of creatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for aught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some inarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody's attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="middlemarch.c81.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="middlemarch.c81.s11"><qs/>"Henrietta Noble,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her small sister moving about the furniture-legs distressfully, <sle/><qs/>"what is the matter?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="middlemarch.c81.p12" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="middlemarch.c81.s22">Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return.</s> <s sid="23" id="middlemarch.c81.s23">She was surprised and annoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently, and that it was quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation.</s> <s sid="24" id="middlemarch.c81.s24">Alarmed at herself--fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked in its occasion, she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised anxiety, <qs/>"I must go; I have overtired myself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="middlemarch.c81.p13" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="middlemarch.c81.s25">Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, <qs/>"It is true; you must have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate.</s> <s sid="26" id="middlemarch.c81.s26">That sort of work tells upon one after the excitement is over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="middlemarch.c81.p14"><s sid="27" id="middlemarch.c81.s27">He gave her his arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to speak, even when he said good-night.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="middlemarch.c81.p15"><s sid="28" id="middlemarch.c81.s28">The limit of resistance was reached, and she had sunk back helpless within the clutch of inescapable anguish.</s> <s sid="29" id="middlemarch.c81.s29">Dismissing Tantripp with a few faint words, she locked her door, and turning away from it towards the vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head, and moaned out--</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="middlemarch.c81.p16" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="middlemarch.c81.s30"><qs/>"Oh, I did love him!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="middlemarch.c81.p17"><s sid="31" id="middlemarch.c81.s31">Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too thoroughly to leave any power of thought.</s> <s sid="32" id="middlemarch.c81.s32">She could only cry in loud whispers, between her sobs, after her lost belief which she had planted and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome--after her lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized by others, was worthy in her thought--after her lost woman's pride of reigning in his memory--after her sweet dim perspective of hope, that along some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take up the backward years as a yesterday.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="middlemarch.c81.p18"><s sid="33" id="middlemarch.c81.s33">In that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man--she besought hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the mysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she lay on the bare floor and let the night grow cold around her; while her grand woman's frame was shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="middlemarch.c81.p19"><s sid="34" id="middlemarch.c81.s34">There were two images--two living forms that tore her heart in two, as if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the lying woman that has never known the mother's pang.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="middlemarch.c81.p20"><s sid="35" id="middlemarch.c81.s35">Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she had trusted--who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim vault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a full consciousness which had never awakened before, she stretched out her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness was a parting vision: she discovered her passion to herself in the unshrinking utterance of despair.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="middlemarch.c81.p21"><s sid="36" id="middlemarch.c81.s36">And there, aloof, yet persistently with her, moving wherever she moved, was the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a detected illusion--no, a living man towards whom there could not yet struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and indignation and jealous offended pride.</s> <s sid="37" id="middlemarch.c81.s37">The fire of Dorothea's anger was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning reproach.</s> <s sid="38" id="middlemarch.c81.s38">Why had he come obtruding his life into hers, hers that might have been whole enough without him?</s> <s sid="39" id="middlemarch.c81.s39">Why had he brought his cheap regard and his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in exchange?</s> <s sid="40" id="middlemarch.c81.s40">He knew that he was deluding her--wished, in the very moment of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before.</s> <s sid="41" id="middlemarch.c81.s41">Why had he not stayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing--but only prayed that they might be less contemptible?</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="middlemarch.c81.p22"><s sid="42" id="middlemarch.c81.s42">But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she sobbed herself to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="middlemarch.c81.p23"><s sid="43" id="middlemarch.c81.s43">In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around her, she awoke--not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had happened, but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into the eyes of sorrow.</s> <s sid="44" id="middlemarch.c81.s44">She rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and seated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before.</s> <s sid="45" id="middlemarch.c81.s45">She was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill in body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she had waked to a new condition: she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible conflict; she was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts.</s> <s sid="46" id="middlemarch.c81.s46">For now the thoughts came thickly.</s> <s sid="47" id="middlemarch.c81.s47">It was not in Dorothea's nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the narrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness that only sees another's lot as an accident of its own.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="middlemarch.c81.p24"><s sid="48" id="middlemarch.c81.s48">She began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately again, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible meaning.</s> <s sid="49" id="middlemarch.c81.s49">Was she alone in that scene?</s> <s sid="50" id="middlemarch.c81.s50">Was it her event only?</s> <s sid="51" id="middlemarch.c81.s51">She forced herself to think of it as bound up with another woman's life--a woman towards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth.</s> <s sid="52" id="middlemarch.c81.s52">In her first outleap of jealous indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she had flung away all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit.</s> <s sid="53" id="middlemarch.c81.s53">She had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to her as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever.</s> <s sid="54" id="middlemarch.c81.s54">But that base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and had once shown her the truer measure of things.</s> <s sid="55" id="middlemarch.c81.s55">All the active thought with which she had before been representing to herself the trials of Lydgate's lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own, seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles--all this vivid sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as we saw in the day of our ignorance.</s> <s sid="56" id="middlemarch.c81.s56">She said to her own irremediable grief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her back from effort.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="middlemarch.c81.p25" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="middlemarch.c81.s57">And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact with hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants bearing the sacred branch?</s> <s sid="58" id="middlemarch.c81.s58">The objects of her rescue were not to be sought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her.</s> <s sid="59" id="middlemarch.c81.s59">She yearned towards the perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her, and rule her errant will.</s> <s sid="60" id="middlemarch.c81.s60"><qs/>"What should I do--how should I act now, this very day, if I could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of those three?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="middlemarch.c81.p26"><s sid="61" id="middlemarch.c81.s61">It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light piercing into the room.</s> <s sid="62" id="middlemarch.c81.s62">She opened her curtains, and looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the entrance-gates.</s> <s sid="63" id="middlemarch.c81.s63">On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures moving--perhaps the shepherd with his dog.</s> <s sid="64" id="middlemarch.c81.s64">Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance.</s> <s sid="65" id="middlemarch.c81.s65">She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="middlemarch.c81.p27"><s sid="66" id="middlemarch.c81.s66">What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching murmur which would soon gather distinctness.</s> <s sid="67" id="middlemarch.c81.s67">She took off the clothes which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them, and began to make her toilet.</s> <s sid="68" id="middlemarch.c81.s68">Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came in her dressing-gown.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="middlemarch.c81.p28" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="middlemarch.c81.s69"><qs/>"Why, madam, you've never been in bed this blessed night,"<qe/> burst out Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea's face, which in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater dolorosa.</s> <s sid="70" id="middlemarch.c81.s70"><qs/>"You'll kill yourself, you _will_.</s> <s sid="71" id="middlemarch.c81.s71">Anybody might think now you had a right to give yourself a little comfort."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="middlemarch.c81.p29" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="middlemarch.c81.s72"><qs/>"Don't be alarmed, Tantripp,"<qe/> said Dorothea, smiling.</s> <s sid="73" id="middlemarch.c81.s73"><qs/>"I have slept; I am not ill.  I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible.</s> <s sid="74" id="middlemarch.c81.s74">And I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my new bonnet to-day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="middlemarch.c81.p30" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="middlemarch.c81.s75"><qs/>"They've lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o' pounds' worth less of crape,"<qe/> said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire.</s> <s sid="76" id="middlemarch.c81.s76"><qs/>"There's a reason in mourning, as I've always said; and three folds at the bottom of your skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet--and if ever anybody looked like an angel, it's you in a net quilling--is what's consistent for a second year.</s> <s sid="77" id="middlemarch.c81.s77">At least, that's _my_ thinking,"<qe/><sls/> ended Tantripp, looking anxiously at the fire; <sle/><qs/>"and if anybody was to marry me flattering himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he'd be deceived by his own vanity, that's all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="middlemarch.c81.p31" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="middlemarch.c81.s78"><qs/>"The fire will do, my good Tan,"<qe/><sls/> said Dorothea, speaking as she used to do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; <sle/><qs/>"get me the coffee."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="middlemarch.c81.p32"><s sid="79" id="middlemarch.c81.s79">She folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head against it in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this strange contrariness in her young mistress--that just the morning when she had more of a widow's face than ever, she should have asked for her lighter mourning which she had waived before.</s> <s sid="80" id="middlemarch.c81.s80">Tantripp would never have found the clew to this mystery.</s> <s sid="81" id="middlemarch.c81.s81">Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she had not the less an active life before her because she had buried a private joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all initiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp after even that slight outward help towards calm resolve.</s> <s sid="82" id="middlemarch.c81.s82">For the resolve was not easy.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="middlemarch.c81.p33"><s sid="83" id="middlemarch.c81.s83">Nevertheless at eleven o'clock she was walking towards Middlemarch, having made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably as possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="middlemarch.c82.p5"><s sid="9" id="middlemarch.c82.s9">It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about the circumstances of her yesterday's visit; nay, he appeared to imagine that she had carried it out according to her intention.</s> <s sid="10" id="middlemarch.c82.s10">She had prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have given to the servant if he had not been in the way, but now she was in much anxiety as to the result of his announcement.</s> </p>
