<title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="canada.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="canada.c1.s1">It was in the year 1794, that an English family went out to settle in Canada.</s> <s sid="2" id="canada.c1.s2">This province had been surrendered to us by the French, who first colonized it, more than thirty years previous to the year I have mentioned.</s> <s sid="3" id="canada.c1.s3">It must, however, be recollected, that to emigrate and settle in Canada was, at that time, a very different affair to what it is now.</s> <s sid="4" id="canada.c1.s4">The difficulty of transport, and the dangers incurred, were much greater, for there were no steamboats to stem the currents and the rapids of the rivers; the Indians were still residing in Upper and many portions of Lower Canada, and the country was infested with wild animals of every description--some useful, but many dangerous: moreover, the Europeans were fewer in number, and the major portion of them were French, who were not pleased at the country having been conquered by the English.</s> <s sid="5" id="canada.c1.s5">It is true that a great many English settlers had arrived, and had settled upon different farms; but as the French settlers had already possession of all the best land in Lower Canada, these new settlers were obliged to go into or toward Upper Canada, where, although the land was better, the distance from Quebec and Montreal, and other populous parts, was much greater, and they were left almost wholly to their own resources, and almost without protection.</s> <s sid="6" id="canada.c1.s6">I mention all this, because things are so very different at present: and now I shall state the cause which induced this family to leave their home, and run the risk and dangers which they did.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="canada.c1.p2"><s sid="7" id="canada.c1.s7">Mr. Campbell was of a good parentage, but, being the son of one of the younger branches of the family, his father was not rich, and Mr. Campbell was, of course, brought up to a profession.</s> <s sid="8" id="canada.c1.s8">Mr. Campbell chose that of a surgeon; and after having walked the hospitals (as it is termed), he set up in business and in a few years was considered as a very able man in his profession.</s> <s sid="9" id="canada.c1.s9">His practice increased very fast; and before he was thirty years of age he married.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="canada.c1.s10">Mr. Campbell had an only sister, who resided with him, for their father and mother were both dead.</s> <s sid="11" id="canada.c1.s11">But about five years after his own marriage, a young gentleman paid his addresses to her; and although not rich, as his character was unexceptionable, and his prospects good, he was accepted.</s> <s sid="12" id="canada.c1.s12">Miss Campbell changed her name to Percival, and left her brother's house to follow her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="canada.c1.p4"><s sid="13" id="canada.c1.s13">Time passed quickly; and, at the end of ten years, Mr. Campbell found himself with a flourishing business, and at the same time with a family to support, his wife having presented him with four boys, of whom the youngest was but a few months old.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c1.p5"><s sid="14" id="canada.c1.s14">But, although prosperous in his own affairs, one heavy misfortune fell upon Mr. Campbell, which was the loss of his sister, Mrs. Percival, to whom he was most sincerely attached.</s> <s sid="15" id="canada.c1.s15">Her loss was attended with circumstances which rendered it more painful, as, previous to her decease, the house of business in which Mr. Percival was a partner failed; and the incessant toil and anxiety which Mr. Percival underwent brought on a violent fever, which ended in his death.</s> <s sid="16" id="canada.c1.s16">In this state of distress, left a widow with one child of two years old--a little girl--and with the expectation of being shortly again confined, Mrs. Percival was brought to her brother's house, who, with his wife, did all he could to soften down her grief; but she had suffered so much by the loss of her husband, that when the period arrived, her strength was gone, and she died in giving birth to a second daughter.</s> <s sid="17" id="canada.c1.s17">Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, of course, took charge of these two little orphan girls, and brought them up with their own children.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="canada.c1.p6"><s sid="18" id="canada.c1.s18">Such was the state of affairs about ten or eleven years after Mr. Campbell's marriage, when a circumstance occurred as unexpected as it was welcome.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="canada.c1.p7"><s sid="19" id="canada.c1.s19">Mr. Campbell had returned from his round of professional visits; dinner was over, and he was sitting at the table with his wife and elder children (for it was the Christmas holidays, and they were all at home), and the bell had just rung for the nurse to bring down the two little girls and the youngest boy, when the postman rapped at the door, and the parlor-maid brought in a letter with a large black seal.</s> <s sid="20" id="canada.c1.s20">Mr. Campbell opened it, and read as follows:--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="canada.c1.p8"><s sid="21" id="canada.c1.s21">Sir--We have great pleasure in making known to you, that upon the demise of Mr. Sholto Campbell, of Wexton Hall, Cumberland, which took place on the 19th ultimo, the entailed estates, in default of more direct issue, have fallen to you, as nearest of kin; the presumptive heir having perished at sea, or in the East Indies, and not having been heard of for twenty-five years.</s> <s sid="22" id="canada.c1.s22">We beg to be the first to congratulate you upon your accession to real property amounting to PS14,000 per annum.</s> <s sid="23" id="canada.c1.s23">No will has been found, and it has been ascertained that none was ever made by the late Mr. Sholto Campbell.</s> <s sid="24" id="canada.c1.s24">We have, therefore, put seals upon the personal property, and shall wait your pleasure.</s> <s sid="25" id="canada.c1.s25">We can only add, that if in want of professional advice, and not being already engaged, you may command the services of Your most obedient, HARVEY, PAXTON, THORPE, &amp; Co.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="canada.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="canada.c1.s26"><qs/>"What can be the matter, my dear?"<qe/> exclaimed Mrs. Campbell, who had perceived most unusual agitation in her husband's countenance.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="canada.c1.p10"><s sid="27" id="canada.c1.s27">Mr. Campbell made no reply, but handed the letter to his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="canada.c1.p11"><s sid="28" id="canada.c1.s28">Mrs. Campbell read it, and laid it down on the table.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="canada.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="canada.c1.s29"><qs/>"Well, my dear!"<qe/> exclaimed Mr. Campbell, joyfully, and starting up from his chair.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="canada.c1.s30"><qs/>"It is a sudden shock, indeed,"<qe/> observed Mrs. Campbell, thoughtfully and slowly.</s> <s sid="31" id="canada.c1.s31"><qs/>"I have often felt that we could bear up against any adversity.</s> <s sid="32" id="canada.c1.s32">I trust in God, that we may be as well able to support prosperity, by far the hardest task, my dear Campbell, of the two."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="canada.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="canada.c1.s33"><qs/>"You are right, Emily,"<qe/><sls/> replied Mr. Campbell, sitting down again; <sle/><qs/>"we are, and have long been, happy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="canada.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="canada.c1.s34"><qs/>"This sudden wealth can not add to our happiness, my dear husband; I feel it will rather add to our cares; but it may enable us to add to the happiness of others; and with such feelings, let us receive it with thankfulness."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="canada.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="canada.c1.s35"><qs/>"Very true, Emily; but still we must do our duty in that station of life to which it has pleased God to call us.</s> <s sid="36" id="canada.c1.s36">Hitherto I have by my profession been of some benefit to my fellow-creatures; and if in my change of condition I no more leave my warm bed to relieve their sufferings, at all events, I shall have the means of employing others so to do.</s> <s sid="37" id="canada.c1.s37">We must consider ourselves but as the stewards of Him who has bestowed this great wealth upon us, and employ it as may be acceptable to His service."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="canada.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="canada.c1.s38"><qs/>"There my husband spoke as I felt he would,"<qe/> said Mrs. Campbell, rising up, and embracing him.</s> <s sid="39" id="canada.c1.s39"><qs/>"Those who feel as you do can never be too rich."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="canada.c1.p18"><s sid="40" id="canada.c1.s40">I must not dwell too long upon this portion of my narrative.</s> <s sid="41" id="canada.c1.s41">I shall therefore observe that Mr. Campbell took possession of Wexton Hall, and lived in a style corresponding to his increased fortune; but, at the same time, he never let pass an opportunity of doing good, and in this task he was ably assisted by his wife.</s> <s sid="42" id="canada.c1.s42">They had not resided there three or four years before they were considered as a blessing to all around them--encouraging industry, assisting the unfortunate, relieving the indigent, building almshouses and schools, and doing all in their power to promote the welfare and add to the happiness of those within many miles of the Hall.</s> <s sid="43" id="canada.c1.s43">At the time that Mr. Campbell took possession, the estate had been neglected, and required large sums to be laid out upon it, which would much increase its value.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="canada.c1.p19"><s sid="44" id="canada.c1.s44">Thus all the large income of Mr. Campbell was usefully and advantageously employed.</s> <s sid="45" id="canada.c1.s45">The change in Mr. Campbell's fortune had also much changed the prospects of his children.</s> <s sid="46" id="canada.c1.s46">Henry, the eldest, who had been intended for his father's profession, was first sent to a private tutor, and afterward to college.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c1.s47">Alfred, the second boy, had chosen the navy for his profession, and had embarked on board a fine frigate.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c1.s48">The other two boys, one named Percival, who was more than two years old at the time that they took possession of the property, and the other, John, who had been born only a few months, remained at home, receiving tuition from a young curate, who lived near the Hall; while a governess had been procured for Mary and Emma Percival, who were growing up very handsome and intelligent girls.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="canada.c1.p20"><s sid="49" id="canada.c1.s49">Such was the state of affairs at the time when Mr. Campbell had been about ten years in possession of the Wexton estate, when one day he was called upon by Mr. Harvey, the head of the firm which had announced to him his succession to the property.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c1.p21"><s sid="50" id="canada.c1.s50">Mr. Harvey came to inform him that a claimant had appeared, and given notice of his intent to file a bill in Chancery to recover the estate, being, as he asserted, the son of the person who had been considered as the presumptive heir, and who had perished so many years back.</s> <s sid="51" id="canada.c1.s51">Mr. Harvey observed, that although he thought it his duty to make the circumstance known to Mr. Campbell, he considered it as a matter of no consequence, and in all probability would turn out to be a fraud got up by some petty attorney, with a view to a compromise.</s> <s sid="52" id="canada.c1.s52">He requested Mr. Campbell not to allow the circumstance to give him any annoyance, stating that if more was heard of it, Mr. Campbell should be immediately informed.</s> <s sid="53" id="canada.c1.s53">Satisfied with the opinion of Mr. Harvey, Mr. Campbell dismissed the circumstance from his mind, and did not even mention it to his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c1.p22"><s sid="54" id="canada.c1.s54">But three months had not passed away before Mr. Campbell received a letter from his solicitor, in which he informed him that the claim to the estate was carrying on with great vigor, and he was sorry to add, wore (to use his own term) a very ugly appearance; and that the opposite parties would, at all events, put Mr. Campbell to a very considerable expense.</s> <s sid="55" id="canada.c1.s55">The solicitor requested Mr. Campbell's instructions, again asserting, that although it was artfully got up, he considered that it was a fraudulent attempt.</s> <s sid="56" id="canada.c1.s56">Mr. Campbell returned an answer, in which he authorized his solicitor to take every needful precaution, and to incur all necessary expense.</s> <s sid="57" id="canada.c1.s57">On reflection, Mr. Campbell, although much annoyed, determined not to make Mrs. Campbell acquainted with what was going on; it could only distress her, he thought, and he therefore resolved for the present to leave her in ignorance.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER II.</title>
<p pid="1" id="canada.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="canada.c2.s1">After a delay of some months, Mr. Harvey called upon Mr. Campbell, and stated to him that the claim of the opposite party, so far from being fraudulent as he had supposed, was so clear, that he feared the worst results.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="canada.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="canada.c2.s2">It appeared that the heir to the estates, who had remained between Mr. Campbell's title, had married in India, and had subsequently, as it had been supposed, died; but there was full and satisfactory proof that the marriage was valid, and that the party who claimed was his son.</s> <s sid="3" id="canada.c2.s3">It was true, Mr. Harvey observed, that Mr. Campbell might delay for some time the restoration of the property, but that eventually it must be surrendered.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="canada.c2.s4">As soon as Mr. Campbell received this letter, he went to his wife and acquainted her with all that had been going on for some months, and with the reasons which induced him to say nothing to her until the receipt of Mr. Harvey's letter, which he now put into her hands, requesting her opinion on the subject.</s> <s sid="5" id="canada.c2.s5">Mrs. Campbell, after having read the letter, replied--</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="canada.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="canada.c2.s6"><qs/>"It appears, my dear husband, that we have been called to take possession of a property, and to hold for many years that which belongs to another.</s> <s sid="7" id="canada.c2.s7">We are now called upon to give it up to the rightful owner.</s> <s sid="8" id="canada.c2.s8">You ask my opinion; surely there is no occasion to do that.</s> <s sid="9" id="canada.c2.s9">We must of course now, that we know the claim is just, do as we would be done by."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="canada.c2.s10"><qs/>"That is, my dearest, we must surrender it at once, without any more litigation.</s> <s sid="11" id="canada.c2.s11">It certainly has been my feeling ever since I have read Mr. Harvey's letter.</s> <s sid="12" id="canada.c2.s12">Yet it is hard to be beggars."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="canada.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="canada.c2.s13"><qs/>"It _is_ hard, my dear husband, if we may use that term; but, at the same time, it is the will of Heaven.</s> <s sid="14" id="canada.c2.s14">We received the property supposing it to have been our own; we have, I hope, not misused it during the time it has been intrusted to us; and, since it pleases Heaven that we should be deprived of it, let us, at all events, have the satisfaction of acting conscientiously and justly, and trust to Him for our future support."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="canada.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="canada.c2.s15"><qs/>"I will write immediately,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mr. Campbell, <sse/><qs/>"to acquaint Mr. Harvey, that although I litigated the point as long as the claim was considered doubtful, now that he informs me that the other party is the legal heir, I beg that all proceedings may be stopped, as I am willing to give immediate possession."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="canada.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="canada.c2.s16"><qs/>"Do so, my dear,"<qe/> replied his wife, embracing him.</s> <s sid="17" id="canada.c2.s17"><qs/>"We may be poor, but I trust we shall still be happy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="canada.c2.p9"><s sid="18" id="canada.c2.s18">Mr. Campbell sat down and wrote the letter of instructions to his solicitor, sealed it, and sent a groom with it to the post.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="canada.c2.p10"><s sid="19" id="canada.c2.s19">As soon as the servant had closed the door of the room, Mr. Campbell covered his face with his hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="canada.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="canada.c2.s20"><qs/>"It is, indeed, a severe trial,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Campbell, taking the hand of her husband; <sle/><qs/>"but you have done your duty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="canada.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="canada.c2.s21"><qs/>"I care not for myself; I am thinking of my children."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="canada.c2.s22"><qs/>"They must work,"<qe/> replied Mrs. Campbell.</s> <s sid="23" id="canada.c2.s23"><qs/>"Employment is happiness."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="canada.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="canada.c2.s25"><qs/>"I trust they have not been so badly brought up, Campbell, but that they will submit with cheerfulness, and be a source of comfort to us both.</s> <s sid="26" id="canada.c2.s26">Besides, we may not be absolutely beggars."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="canada.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="canada.c2.s27"><qs/>"That depends upon the other party.</s> <s sid="28" id="canada.c2.s28">He may claim all arrears of rent; and if so, we are more than beggars.</s> <s sid="29" id="canada.c2.s29">However, God's will be done.</s> <s sid="30" id="canada.c2.s30">Shall we receive good, and shall we not receive evil?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="canada.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="canada.c2.s31"><qs/>"There's hope, my husband,"<qe/><sls/> replied Mrs. Campbell, in a cheering tone; <sle/><qs/>"let us hope for the best."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="canada.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="canada.c2.s32"><qs/>"How little do we know what is for our good, short-sighted mortals as we are!"<qe/> observed Mr. Campbell.</s> <s sid="33" id="canada.c2.s33"><qs/>"Had not this estate come to us, I should, by following up my profession as surgeon, in all probability, have realized a good provision for my children: now, this seeming good turn of fortune leaves me poor.</s> <s sid="34" id="canada.c2.s34">I am too old now to resume my profession, and, if I did, have no chance of obtaining the practice which I left.</s> <s sid="35" id="canada.c2.s35">You see that which appeared to us and every one else the most fortunate occurrence in my life, has eventually proved the contrary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="canada.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="canada.c2.s36"><qs/>"As far as our limited view of things can enable us to judge, I grant it,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mrs. Campbell; <sse/><qs/>"but who knows what might have happened if we had remained in possession?</s> <s sid="37" id="canada.c2.s37">All is hidden from our view.</s> <s sid="38" id="canada.c2.s38">_He_ acts as he thinks best for us; and it is for us to submit without repining.</s> <s sid="39" id="canada.c2.s39">Come, dearest, let us walk out; the air is fresh, and will cool your heated brow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="canada.c2.p20"><s sid="40" id="canada.c2.s40">Two days after this conversation, a letter was received from Mr. Harvey, informing them that he had made known Mr. Campbell's determination to resign the property without further litigation; that the reply of the other party was highly honorable, stating that it was not his intention to make any claim for the back rents, and requesting that Mr. Campbell and family would consider Wexton Hall at their disposal for three months, to enable them to make arrangements, and dispose of their furniture, etc.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c2.p21"><s sid="41" id="canada.c2.s41">The contents of this letter were a great relief to the mind of Mr. Campbell, as he was now able to ascertain what his future means might be, and was grateful for the handsome behavior of the new proprietor in not making any claim for back rents, which would have reduced him at once to penury.</s> <s sid="42" id="canada.c2.s42">He wrote immediately to Mr. Harvey requesting him to send in his account of legal expenses, that it might be liquidated as soon as possible.</s> <s sid="43" id="canada.c2.s43">In three days it arrived, and a letter with it, in which Mr. Harvey acquainted him, that it was in consequence of his having so handsomely surrendered the property as soon as the claim was substantiated, together with the knowledge how much the estate had been improved during the ten years in which it had been in his possession, which induced the new proprietor to behave in so liberal a manner.</s> <s sid="44" id="canada.c2.s44">This was very gratifying to Mr. Campbell, but the legal expenses proved enormous, amounting to many thousand pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c2.p22"><s sid="45" id="canada.c2.s45">Mr. Campbell read the sum total, and threw the heap of papers down on the table in despair.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="canada.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="canada.c2.s46"><qs/>"We are still ruined, my dear,"<qe/> said he mournfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="canada.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="canada.c2.s49"><qs/>"I have not so much money as will pay this bill by nearly a thousand pounds, my dearest wife."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="canada.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="canada.c2.s50"><qs/>"It may be so,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mrs. Campbell; <sse/><qs/>"but still there is the furniture, the horses, and carriages; surely, they are worth much more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="canada.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="canada.c2.s51"><qs/>"But we have other bills to pay; you forget them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="canada.c2.p29" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="canada.c2.s53"><qs/>"What then do you advise, Emily?"<qe/> said Mr. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="canada.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="canada.c2.s54"><qs/>"We must incur no more expense; our present establishment must be dismissed at once.</s> <s sid="55" id="canada.c2.s55">Send for all the servants to-morrow morning, and explain what has occurred.</s> <s sid="56" id="canada.c2.s56">This evening I will make it known to the two girls and Miss Paterson, who must of course be discharged, as we can no longer afford a governess.</s> <s sid="57" id="canada.c2.s57">We must retain only the cook, housemaid, and footman, and a groom to look after the horses until they are sold.</s> <s sid="58" id="canada.c2.s58">Send a letter to Mr. Bates, the auctioneer, to give notice of an early sale of the furniture.</s> <s sid="59" id="canada.c2.s59">You must write to Henry; of course, he can no longer remain at college.</s> <s sid="60" id="canada.c2.s60">We have plenty of time to consider what shall be our future plans, which must depend much upon what may prove to be our future means."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c7.p3"><s sid="12" id="canada.c7.s12">Mr. Campbell found that, after all his expenses, he had still three hundred pounds left, and this money he left in the Quebec Bank, to use as he might find necessary.</s> <s sid="13" id="canada.c7.s13">His expenditure had been very great.</s> <s sid="14" id="canada.c7.s14">First, there was the removal of so large a family, and the passage out; then he had procured at Liverpool a large quantity of cutlery and tools, furniture, etc., all of which articles were cheaper there than at Quebec.</s> <s sid="15" id="canada.c7.s15">At Quebec he had also much to purchase: all the most expensive portion of his house; such as windows ready glazed, stoves, boarding for floors, cupboards, and partitions; salt provisions, crockery of every description, two small wagons ready to be put together, several casks of nails, and a variety of things which it would be too tedious to mention.</s> <s sid="16" id="canada.c7.s16">Procuring these, with the expenses of living, had taken away all his money, except the three hundred pounds I have mentioned.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c7.p5"><s sid="20" id="canada.c7.s20">And it is not to be wondered at that they were silent, for all were occupied with their own thoughts.</s> <s sid="21" id="canada.c7.s21">They called to mind the beautiful park at Wexton, which they had quitted, after having resided there so long and so happily; the hall, with all its splendor and all its comfort, rose up in their remembrance; each room with its furniture, each window with its view, was recalled to their memories; they had crossed the Atlantic, and were now about to leave civilization and comfort behind them--to isolate themselves in the Canadian woods--to trust to their own resources, their own society, and their own exertions.</s> <s sid="22" id="canada.c7.s22">It was, indeed, the commencement of a new life, and for which they felt themselves little adapted, after the luxuries they had enjoyed in their former condition; but if their thoughts and reminiscences made them grave and silent, they did not make them despairing or repining; they trusted to that Power who alone could protect--who gives and who takes away, and doeth with us as He judges best; and if hope was not buoyant in all of them, still there was confidence, resolution, and resignation.</s> <s sid="23" id="canada.c7.s23">Gradually they were roused from their reveries by the beauty of the scenery and the novelty of what met their sight; the songs, also, of the Canadian boatmen were musical and cheering, and by degrees, they had all recovered their usual good spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c7.p21"><s sid="46" id="canada.c7.s46">All the party were now standing up in the sternsheets of the _bateau_ to look at the people on the raft, who amounted to about fifty or sixty men--now running over the top to one side, and dragging at the sweeps, which required the joint power of seven or eight men to each of them--now passing again over to the opposite sweeps, as directed by the steersmen.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c7.s47">The _bateau_ kept well in to the shore, out of the way, and the raft passed them very quickly.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c7.s48">As soon as it was clear of the point, as their course to Quebec was now straight, and there was a slight breeze down the river, the people on board of the raft hoisted ten or fifteen sails upon different masts, to assist them in their descent; and this again excited the admiration of the party.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c7.p22"><s sid="49" id="canada.c7.s49">The conversation now became general, until the _bateaux_ were made fast to the shores of the river, while the men took their dinners, which had been prepared for them before they left Quebec.</s> <s sid="50" id="canada.c7.s50">After a repose of two hours, they again started, and at nightfall arrived at St.</s> <s sid="51" id="canada.c7.s51">Anne's, where they found every thing ready for their reception.</s> <s sid="52" id="canada.c7.s52">Although their beds were composed of the leaves of the maize or Indian corn, they were so tired that they found them very comfortable, and at daylight arose quite refreshed, and anxious to continue their route.</s> <s sid="53" id="canada.c7.s53">Martin Super, who, with the two youngest boys, had been placed in a separate boat, had been very attentive to the comforts of the ladies after their embarkation; and it appeared that he had quite won the hearts of the two boys by his amusing anecdotes during the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="canada.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="canada.c13.s1">In the course of a week or two, things found their places, and the family began to feel more comfortable; there was also a degree of regularity and order established, which could not be effected during the time that the soldiers were employed.</s> <s sid="2" id="canada.c13.s2">Mrs. Campbell and Percival took upon them all the work inside and round the house during the morning; the latter attending to the pigs and fowls, bringing water from the stream, etc.</s> <s sid="3" id="canada.c13.s3">Mary and Emma milked the cows, and then assisted their mother during the day in washing, etc.</s> <s sid="4" id="canada.c13.s4">Mr. Campbell instructed Percival, worked in the garden, and assisted as much as he could, where he might be found most useful; but he was too advanced in years to be capable of much hard work.</s> <s sid="5" id="canada.c13.s5">Alfred, Henry and Martin Super were employed during the whole day, clearing the ground and felling the timber; but every other day, one or the other went out with Martin into the woods to procure food, bringing home with them deer, wild turkeys, or other game, which with an occasional piece of salt-pork, and the fish caught, were sufficient for the family consumption.</s> <s sid="6" id="canada.c13.s6">Percival was now permitted to accompany the hunting-parties, and became somewhat expert with his rifle.</s> <s sid="7" id="canada.c13.s7">He required only a little more practice to be a good shot.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="canada.c13.p2"><s sid="8" id="canada.c13.s8">They rose at half-past five,--were all assembled to prayers at half-past seven, previous to going to breakfast.</s> <s sid="9" id="canada.c13.s9">They dined at one, and had a combined tea and supper at seven o'clock.</s> <s sid="10" id="canada.c13.s10">At nine o'clock they went to bed.</s> <s sid="11" id="canada.c13.s11">Before two months had passed away, every thing went on like clock-work.</s> <s sid="12" id="canada.c13.s12">One day passed away so like another, that the time flew imperceptibly, and they wondered that the Sundays came round so quick.</s> <s sid="13" id="canada.c13.s13">They had now time to unpack every thing, and the books which Mrs. Campbell had selected and brought with her had been arranged on shelves in the parlor; but they had not as yet much time to read, and were generally too tired before the day was over not to long for their beds.</s> <s sid="14" id="canada.c13.s14">Indeed, the only interval of leisure during the whole day was between supper and bedtime, when they would all assemble in the kitchen and talk over the little matters which had occurred either during the chase or at home.</s> <s sid="15" id="canada.c13.s15">But they were now in the middle of October, the winter was fast approaching, and they looked forward to it with some degree of anxiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c13.p3"><s sid="16" id="canada.c13.s16">John had kept his word very sacredly.</s> <s sid="17" id="canada.c13.s17">He was occasionally absent for three or four days, but if so, he invariably came to the house and remained a day or two at home.</s> <s sid="18" id="canada.c13.s18">Alfred and Martin had long finished the fishing-punt, and as it was light and easily handled, Henry and Percival went out in it together, and when he was at home, John with Percival would pull half a mile out into the lake, and soon return with a supply of large fish.</s> <s sid="19" id="canada.c13.s19">Mrs. Campbell, therefore, had salted down sufficient to fill a barrel for the winter's use.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="canada.c13.p4"><s sid="20" id="canada.c13.s20">One day they were agreeably surprised by Captain Sinclair making his appearance.</s> <s sid="21" id="canada.c13.s21">He had walked from the fort, to communicate to them that the hay had been gathered in, and would be sent round in a day or two, and also to inform Mr. Campbell that the commandant could spare them a young bullock, if he would wish to have it for winter provision.</s> <s sid="22" id="canada.c13.s22">This offer was gladly accepted, and, having partaken of their dinner, Captain Sinclair was obliged to return to the fort, he being that night on duty.</s> <s sid="23" id="canada.c13.s23">Previous, however, to his return, he had some conversation with Martin Super, unobserved by the rest of the party.</s> <s sid="24" id="canada.c13.s24">Afterward he invited Alfred to walk back to the fort with him and return on the following morning.</s> <s sid="25" id="canada.c13.s25">Alfred agreed to do so; and two hours before it was dark they set off, and as soon as they were on the opposite side of the brook they were joined by Martin Super.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c13.p5" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="canada.c13.s26"><qs/>"My reasons for asking you to come back with me were twofold,"<qe/> said Captain Sinclair to Alfred.</s> <s sid="27" id="canada.c13.s27"><qs/>"In the first place, I wish you to know the road to the fort, in case it should be necessary to make any communication during the winter; secondly, I wished to have some conversation with you and Martin relative to information we have received about the Indians.</s> <s sid="28" id="canada.c13.s28">I can tell you privately what I was unwilling to say before your mother and cousins, as it would put them in a state of restlessness and anxiety, which could avail nothing and only annoy them.</s> <s sid="29" id="canada.c13.s29">The fact is, we have for some time had information that the Indians have held several councils.</s> <s sid="30" id="canada.c13.s30">It does not appear, however, that they have as yet decided upon any thing, although it is certain that they have gathered together in large numbers not very far from the fort.</s> <s sid="31" id="canada.c13.s31">No doubt but they have French emissaries inciting them to attack us.</s> <s sid="32" id="canada.c13.s32">From what we can learn, however, they have not agreed among themselves, and, therefore, in all probability, nothing will be attempted until next year, for the autumn is their season for sending out their war-parties.</s> <s sid="33" id="canada.c13.s33">At the same time, there is no security, for there is a great difference between a junction of all the tribes against us and a common Indian war-party.</s> <s sid="34" id="canada.c13.s34">We must, therefore, be on the alert, for we have a treacherous foe to deal with.</s> <s sid="35" id="canada.c13.s35">And now, for your portion of interest in this affair.</s> <s sid="36" id="canada.c13.s36">If they attack the fort, which they may do, notwithstanding our treaties with them, you of course would not be safe where you are; but, unfortunately, you may not be safe even if we are not molested; for when the Indians collect (even though the main body decide upon nothing), there are always bands of five to ten Indians, who, having left their homes, will not return if they can help it without some booty; these are not regular warriors, or if warriors, not much esteemed by the tribe; in fact, they are the worst classes of Indians, who are mere robbers and banditti.</s> <s sid="37" id="canada.c13.s37">You must, therefore, be on the look-out for the visits of these people.</s> <s sid="38" id="canada.c13.s38">It is fortunate for you that old Bone has shifted his abode so many miles to the westward, and that you are on such good terms with him, as it is not very likely that any party of Indians can approach you without his meeting with them or their track during his excursions."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="canada.c13.p6" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="canada.c13.s39"><qs/>"That's true, Captain,"<qe/><sss/> observed Martin, <sse/><qs/>"and I will go myself and put him on his guard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="canada.c13.p7" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="canada.c13.s40"><qs/>"But, will they not attack him before they attack us?"<qe/> said Alfred.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="canada.c13.p8" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="canada.c13.s41"><qs/>"Why should they?"<qe/> replied Sinclair.</s> <s sid="42" id="canada.c13.s42"><qs/>"He is as much an Indian almost as they are, and is well known to most of them.</s> <s sid="43" id="canada.c13.s43">Besides, what would they gain by attacking him?</s> <s sid="44" id="canada.c13.s44">These straggling parties, which you have to fear, are in quest of booty, and will not expect to find any thing in his wigwam except a few furs.</s> <s sid="45" id="canada.c13.s45">No; they will not venture near his rifle, which they fear, when there is nothing to be obtained by so doing.</s> <s sid="46" id="canada.c13.s46">I mention this to you, Alfred, that you may be prepared and keep a sharp look-out.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c13.s47">It is very possible that nothing of the kind may occur, and that the winter may pass away without any danger, and I mention it to you and Martin, as I consider that the probabilities are not sufficient to warrant your alarming the other members of the family, especially the female portion of it.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c13.s48">How far you may consider it advisable to communicate what has now passed to your father and Henry, it is for you to decide.</s> <s sid="49" id="canada.c13.s49">As I said before, I do not imagine you have much to fear from a general attack; it is too late in the year, and we know that the councils broke up without coming to any decision.</s> <s sid="50" id="canada.c13.s50">You have only to fear the attempts of small parties of marauders, and I think you are quite strong enough, both in numbers and in the defenses of your habitation, to resist them successfully, if you are not suddenly surprised.</s> <s sid="51" id="canada.c13.s51">That is all that you have to fear; and now that you are warned, half the danger is over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="canada.c13.p9" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="canada.c13.s52"><qs/>"Well, Captain, I'll leave you now,"<qe/><sss/> said Martin, <sse/><qs/>"I shall go over to old Malachi's to-night; for it occurs to me that any attack is more likely to be made between the fall of the leaf and the fall of the snow than afterward; so the sooner I put Malachi on his guard the better.</s> <s sid="53" id="canada.c13.s53">Good-evening, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="canada.c13.p10"><s sid="54" id="canada.c13.s54">Captain Sinclair and Alfred continued on their way to the fort.</s> <s sid="55" id="canada.c13.s55">They had contracted a strong friendship, and were unreserved in their communication with each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="canada.c13.p11" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="canada.c13.s56"><qs/>"You have no idea, Alfred,"<qe/><sss/> said Captain Sinclair, <sse/><qs/>"how the peculiar position of your family occupies my thoughts.</s> <s sid="57" id="canada.c13.s57">It really appears almost like madness on the part of your father to bring out your mother and cousins to such a place, and expose them to such privations and dangers.</s> <s sid="58" id="canada.c13.s58">I can hardly sleep at night when I reflect upon what might happen."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="canada.c13.p12" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="canada.c13.s59"><qs/>"I believe,"<qe/><sss/> replied Alfred, <sse/><qs/>"that if my father had known exactly what his present position would have been, he would have decided upon not leaving England; but you must remember that he came out with much encouragement, and the idea that he would only have to surmount the hardships of a settler in clearing his land.</s> <s sid="60" id="canada.c13.s60">He fancied, at least I'm sure _we_ all did, that we should be surrounded by other farmers, and have no particular danger to incur.</s> <s sid="61" id="canada.c13.s61">When at Quebec, he found that all the good land near to civilization was bought up or possessed by the French Canadians; he was advised to come further westward by those who ought to have been aware of what he would have to encounter by so doing, but who probably considered that the danger we now apprehend no longer existed; and he has followed that advice which I have no doubt was conscientiously given.</s> <s sid="62" id="canada.c13.s62">I think myself, even now, that the advice was good, although we are accompanied by females who have been brought up in so different a sphere, and for whose welfare such anxiety is shown; for observe now, Sinclair, suppose, without having made our acquaintance, you had heard that some settlers, men and women, had located themselves where we have done; should you have considered it so very rash an undertaking, presuming that they were merely farmers and farmers' wives?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c13.p13" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="canada.c13.s63"><qs/>"I certainly should have troubled myself very little about them, and perhaps not thought upon the subject."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="canada.c13.p14" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="canada.c13.s64"><qs/>"But supposing the subject had been brought up at the fort, and you had heard the parties had a stockaded house and four or five good rifles to depend upon, with the fort to fall back upon if necessary?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="canada.c13.p15" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="canada.c13.s65"><qs/>"I admit that I should most probably have said that they were in a position to protect themselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="canada.c13.p16" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="canada.c13.s66"><qs/>"Most assuredly, and therefore we are equally so; your feelings of interest in us magnify the danger, and I therefore trust that in future you will not allow our position to interfere with your night's rest."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="canada.c13.p17" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="canada.c13.s67"><qs/>"I wish I could bring myself to that feeling of security, Alfred.</s> <s sid="68" id="canada.c13.s68">If I were only with you, to assist in protecting them, I should sleep sound enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="canada.c13.p18" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="canada.c13.s69"><qs/>"Then you would not be of much use as a watch,"<qe/> replied Alfred, laughing.</s> <s sid="70" id="canada.c13.s70"><qs/>"Never fear, Sinclair, we shall do well enough,"<qe/><sss/> continued he, <sse/><qs/>"and if we require assistance, we will apply for you and a party of soldiers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="canada.c13.p19" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="canada.c13.s71"><qs/>"There would be much difficulty about that, Alfred,"<qe/><sss/> replied Captain Sinclair; <sse/><qs/>"if there were sufficient danger to make that demand upon the commandant, the same danger would require that he should not weaken his force in the fort; no, you would have to retreat to the fort, and leave your farm to the mercy of the Indians."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="canada.c13.p20" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="canada.c13.s72"><qs/>"It certainly would be the wisest plan of the two,"<qe/><sss/> replied Alfred; <sse/><qs/>"at all events, we could send the women.</s> <s sid="73" id="canada.c13.s73">But the Indians have not come yet, and we must hope that they will not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c13.p21"><s sid="74" id="canada.c13.s74">The conversation was then changed, and in half an hour more they arrived at the fort.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c13.p22"><s sid="75" id="canada.c13.s75">Alfred was welcomed at the fort by Colonel Forster, with whom he was a great favorite.</s> <s sid="76" id="canada.c13.s76">The Colonel could not refrain from expressing his opinion, that Mr. Campbell and his family were in a position of some danger, and lamenting that the female portion of the family, who had been brought up with such very different prospects, should be so situated.</s> <s sid="77" id="canada.c13.s77">He even ventured to hint that if Mrs. Campbell and the two Misses Percival would pass the winter in the fort he would make arrangements to accommodate them.</s> <s sid="78" id="canada.c13.s78">But Alfred at once replied, that he was convinced no inducement would persuade his mother or cousins to leave his father; they had shared his prosperity, and they would cling to him in adversity; that they all were aware of what they would have to risk before they came out, and his father preferred a life of honorable independence attended with danger, to seeking the assistance of others.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="canada.c13.p23" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="canada.c13.s79"><qs/>"But still I can not perceive any reason for the ladies remaining to encounter the danger."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="canada.c13.p24" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="canada.c13.s80"><qs/>"The more we are, the stronger we are to repel danger,"<qe/> replied Alfred.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="canada.c13.p25" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="canada.c13.s81"><qs/>"But women surely will only be an incumbrance!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="canada.c13.p26" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="canada.c13.s82"><qs/>"I think differently,"<qe/> replied Alfred.</s> <s sid="83" id="canada.c13.s83"><qs/>"Young and delicate as my cousins are, they will not shrink any more than my mother when their services are required.</s> <s sid="84" id="canada.c13.s84">They now can all of them use a rifle, if required, and to defend a house, a determined woman is almost as effective as a man.</s> <s sid="85" id="canada.c13.s85">Depend upon it, if it comes to the necessity, they will do so.</s> <s sid="86" id="canada.c13.s86">You see, therefore, Colonel, that by taking away our ladies, you will weaken our force,"<qe/> continued Alfred, laughing.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="canada.c13.p27" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="canada.c13.s87"><qs/>"Well, my dear fellow, I will press it no more.</s> <s sid="88" id="canada.c13.s88">Only recollect that I shall always be ready to send you any assistance when required."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="canada.c13.p28" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="canada.c13.s89"><qs/>"I have been thinking, Colonel Forster, that, as we have no horses at present, if you have any rockets, they might be useful in such a case.</s> <s sid="90" id="canada.c13.s90">At the distance we are from you a rocket would be seen immediately if fired at night, and I promise you, that it shall not be fired without great necessity."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="canada.c13.p29" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="canada.c13.s91"><qs/>"I am glad that you have mentioned it, Alfred; you shall have a dozen to take with you.</s> <s sid="92" id="canada.c13.s92">You go back with the boats that carry the hay to-morrow morning, do you not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="canada.c13.p30" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="canada.c13.s93"><qs/>"Yes; I shall take that opportunity, to save wearing out my shoes, as we have no cobbler near to us.</s> <s sid="94" id="canada.c13.s94">I presume it will be the last trip made by the boats this season?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="canada.c13.p31" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="canada.c13.s95"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> replied the Colonel, <sse/><qs/>"the frost will soon set in now.</s> <s sid="96" id="canada.c13.s96">In another fortnight we shall probably be visited with a heavy fall of snow, and the ground will then be covered till spring.</s> <s sid="97" id="canada.c13.s97">But I suppose we shall see or hear from you occasionally?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="canada.c13.p32" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="canada.c13.s98"><qs/>"Yes; as soon as I can push along in my snow-shoes, I will pay you a visit,"<qe/><sss/> replied Alfred, <sse/><qs/>"but I have that art to learn yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="canada.c13.p33"><s sid="99" id="canada.c13.s99">The following morning the sky was clear and the day brilliant.</s> <s sid="100" id="canada.c13.s100">The sun shone upon the dark, scarlet-tinged foliage of the oaks, and through the transparent yellow leaves of the maple.</s> <s sid="101" id="canada.c13.s101">A slight frost had appeared for two or three mornings about a month back, and now they were enjoying what was termed the Indian summer, which is a return of fair and rather warm weather for a short time previous to the winter setting in.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="canada.c13.p34"><s sid="102" id="canada.c13.s102">The soldiers were busy carrying the hay down to the _bateaux_, and, before noon, Alfred bade farewell to Colonel Forster and the other officers of the fort, and, accompanied by Captain Sinclair, went down to embark.</s> <s sid="103" id="canada.c13.s103">All was ready, and Alfred stepped into the boat; Captain Sinclair being on duty and not able to accompany him back.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="canada.c17.p2"><s sid="3" id="canada.c17.s3">As the party were sitting down to dinner, they were greeted by Captain Sinclair and a young lieutenant of the garrison.</s> <s sid="4" id="canada.c17.s4">It hardly need be said that the whole family were delighted to see them.</s> <s sid="5" id="canada.c17.s5">They had come overland on their snow-shoes, and brought some partridges, or grouse, as they are sometimes called, which they had shot on their way.</s> <s sid="6" id="canada.c17.s6">Captain Sinclair had obtained leave from the commandant to come over and see how the Campbells were getting on.</s> <s sid="7" id="canada.c17.s7">He had no news of any importance, as they had had no recent communications with Quebec or Montreal; all was well at the fort, and Colonel Forster had sent his compliments, and begged, if he could be useful, that they would let him know.</s> <s sid="8" id="canada.c17.s8">Captain Sinclair and his friend sat down to dinner, and talked more than they ate, asking questions about every thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c17.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="canada.c17.s9"><qs/>"By the by, Mr. Campbell, where have you built your pig-sties?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c17.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="canada.c17.s11"><qs/>"That is well,"<qe/><sss/> replied Captain Sinclair, <sse/><qs/>"for otherwise you may be troubled by the wolves, who are very partial to pork or mutton."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="canada.c17.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="canada.c17.s12"><qs/>"We _have_ been troubled with them,"<qe/><sss/> replied Emma; <sse/><qs/>"at least with their howlings at night, which make me tremble as I lie awake in bed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="canada.c17.p7" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="canada.c17.s13"><qs/>"Never mind their howling, Miss Emma; we have plenty of them round the fort, I can assure you; unless attacked, they will not attack you, at least, I never knew an instance, although I must confess that I have heard of them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="canada.c17.p8" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="canada.c17.s14"><qs/>"You will, of course, sleep here to-night?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="canada.c17.p11" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="canada.c17.s17"><qs/>"And if you could manage, Captain Sinclair,"<qe/><sss/> said Emma, somewhat archly, <sse/><qs/>"as you say that they are not dangerous animals, to bring us a few skins to-night, it would make the matter easy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="canada.c17.p12" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="canada.c17.s18"><qs/>"Emma, how can you talk such nonsense?"<qe/> cried Mary Percival.</s> <s sid="19" id="canada.c17.s19"><qs/>"Why should you ask a guest to undertake such a service?</s> <s sid="20" id="canada.c17.s20">Why have you not proposed it to Alfred or Henry, or even Martin?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c17.p13" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="canada.c17.s21"><qs/>"We will both try, if you please,"<qe/> replied Alfred.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="canada.c17.p18" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="canada.c17.s34"><qs/>"Yes; and so is Emma, I think.</s> <s sid="35" id="canada.c17.s35">She has grown half a head since she left England.</s> <s sid="36" id="canada.c17.s36">By the by, you have to congratulate me on my obtaining my rank as lieutenant."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c17.p21"><s sid="42" id="canada.c17.s42">The accession to their party made them all very lively, and the evening passed away very agreeably.</s> <s sid="43" id="canada.c17.s43">At night, Captain Sinclair and Mr. Gwynne were ushered into the large bedroom, where all the younger male portion of the family slept, and which, as we before stated, had two spare bed-places.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c17.p22"><s sid="44" id="canada.c17.s44">The next morning, Captain Sinclair would have accompanied the Miss Percivals on their milking expedition, but as his services were required to haul up the fishing punt, he was obliged to go down, with all the rest of the men, to assist; Percival and John were the only ones left at home with Mrs. Campbell.</s> <s sid="45" id="canada.c17.s45">John, after a time, having, as usual, rubbed down his rifle, threw it on his shoulder, and, calling the dogs which lay about, sallied forth for a walk, followed by the whole pack except old Sancho, who invariably accompanied the girls to the cow-house.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="canada.c17.p23"><s sid="46" id="canada.c17.s46">Mary and Emma tripped over the new-beaten snow-path to the cow-house, merry and cheerful, with their pails in their hands, Emma laughing at Captain Sinclair's disappointment at not being permitted to accompany them.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c17.s47">They had just arrived at the cow-house, when old Sancho barked furiously, and sprang to the side of the building behind them, and in a moment afterward rolled down the snowheap which he had sprung over, holding on and held fast by a large black wolf.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c17.s48">The struggle was not very long, and during the time that it lasted the girls were so panic-struck, that they remained like statues within two yards of the animals.</s> <s sid="49" id="canada.c17.s49">Gradually the old dog was overpowered by the repeated snapping bites of the wolf, yet he fought nobly to the last, when he dropped under the feet of the wolf, his tongue hanging out, and bleeding profusely and lifeless.</s> <s sid="50" id="canada.c17.s50">As soon as his adversary was overpowered, the enraged animal, with his feet upon the body of the dog, bristling his hair and showing his powerful teeth, was evidently about to attack the young women.</s> <s sid="51" id="canada.c17.s51">Emma threw her arm around Mary's waist, advancing her body so as to save her sister.</s> <s sid="52" id="canada.c17.s52">Mary attempted the same, and then they remained waiting in horror for the expected spring of the animal, when of a sudden the other dogs came rushing forward, cheered on by John, and flew upon the animal.</s> <s sid="53" id="canada.c17.s53">Their united strength soon tore him down to the ground, and John coming up, as the wolf defended himself against his new assailants, put the muzzle of his rifle to the animal's head, and shot it dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="canada.c17.p24"><s sid="54" id="canada.c17.s54">The two sisters had held up during the whole of this alarming struggle; but as soon as they perceived the wolf was dead and that they were safe, Mary could stand no longer, and sank down on her knees, supporting her sister, who had become insensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="canada.c17.p25" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="canada.c17.s55">If John showed gallantry in shooting the wolf, he certainly showed very little toward his cousins.</s> <s sid="56" id="canada.c17.s56">He looked at Mary, nodded his head toward the wolf's body, and saying <qs/>"He's dead,"<qe/> shouldered his rifle, turned round and walked back to the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="canada.c17.p26"><s sid="57" id="canada.c17.s57">On his return he found that the party had just come back from hauling up the punt, and were waiting the return of the Miss Percivals to go to breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="canada.c17.p27" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="canada.c17.s58"><qs/>"Was that you who fired just now, John?"<qe/> said Martin.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="canada.c17.p38" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="canada.c17.s69"><qs/>"With the wolf,"<qe/> replied John, wiping his rifle very coolly.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="canada.c17.p39" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="canada.c17.s70"><qs/>"Merciful Heaven!"<qe/> cried Mr. Campbell, as Mrs. Campbell turned pale; and Alfred, Captain Sinclair, Martin, and Henry, seizing their rifles, darted out from the house, and ran with all speed in the direction of the cow-house.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="canada.c17.p40" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="canada.c17.s71"><qs/>"My poor girls!"<qe/> exclaimed Mrs. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="canada.c17.p41" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="canada.c17.s72"><qs/>"Wolf's dead, father,"<qe/> said John.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="canada.c17.p43" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="canada.c17.s75"><qs/>"I wasn't asked,"<qe/> replied John.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="canada.c17.p44"><s sid="76" id="canada.c17.s76">In the meantime the other party had gained the cow-house; and, to their horror, beheld the wolf and dog dead, and the two young women lying on the snow, close to the two animals; for Mary had fainted away shortly after John had walked off.</s> <s sid="77" id="canada.c17.s77">They rushed toward the bodies of the two girls, and soon discovered that they were not hurt.</s> <s sid="78" id="canada.c17.s78">In a short time they were recovered, and were supported by the young men to the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="canada.c17.p45"><s sid="79" id="canada.c17.s79">As soon as they arrived, Mrs. Campbell took them into their room, that they might rally their spirits, and in a quarter of an hour returned to the party outside, who eagerly inquired how they were.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="canada.c17.p46" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="canada.c17.s80"><qs/>"They are much more composed,"<qe/><sss/> replied Mrs. Campbell; <sse/><qs/>"and Emma has begun to laugh again; but her laugh is rather hysterical and forced; they will come out at dinner-time.</s> <s sid="81" id="canada.c17.s81">It appears they are indebted to John for their preservation, for they say the wolf was about to spring upon them when he came to their assistance.</s> <s sid="82" id="canada.c17.s82">We ought to be very grateful to Heaven for their preservation.</s> <s sid="83" id="canada.c17.s83">I had no idea, after what Martin said about the wolves, that they were so dangerous."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="canada.c17.p48" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="canada.c17.s86"><qs/>"Yes; it was the fault of Martin and me,"<qe/> replied Alfred.</s> <s sid="87" id="canada.c17.s87"><qs/>"Thank Heaven it's no worse!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="canada.c17.p49" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="canada.c17.s88"><qs/>"So far from it being a subject of regret, I consider it one of thankfulness,"<qe/> replied Mr. Campbell.</s> <s sid="89" id="canada.c17.s89"><qs/>"This might have happened when there was no one to assist, and our dear girls might have been torn to pieces.</s> <s sid="90" id="canada.c17.s90">Now that we know the danger, we may guard against it for the future."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="canada.c17.p52" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="canada.c17.s97"><qs/>"Mother called me naughty,"<qe/> replied John, rather sulkily.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="canada.c22.p14"><s sid="44" id="canada.c22.s44">Mr. Campbell, as soon as he perceived that Malachi no longer avoided them, thought it but his duty to offer him his land back again, but Malachi would not consent to accept it.</s> <s sid="45" id="canada.c22.s45">He said he did not want the land, although perhaps, he might raise his lodge a little nearer to them than it was; at present, things had better remain as they were; after which Mr. Campbell did not renew the subject.</s> <s sid="46" id="canada.c22.s46">Malachi soon acted upon his remark, that perhaps he might raise his lodge a little nearer, for, a few days afterward, he made his appearance with the Strawberry and John, all three loaded with his household utensils, and in a very short time he had erected another wigwam within sight of the house at the western end of Mr. Campbell's prairie.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c22.s47">This gave great satisfaction to Mrs. Campbell, because John was now always near them; indeed, he no longer slept in the lodge, but at the house, in the room with his brothers.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c22.s48">The major part of the day he passed at the lodge, or in company with the old hunter; but, by this new arrangement, they gradually became, as it were, one family; not a day passed that the Strawberry did not come to their house and make herself useful, assisting in every thing that she could, and rapidly learning what she did not know.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="canada.c22.p15"><s sid="49" id="canada.c22.s49">One or two evenings after the message from the fort, Mrs. Campbell asked Malachi some questions relative to the habits of the beaver, as she had heard much of the sagacity of that animal.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="canada.c36.p10"><s sid="33" id="canada.c36.s33">He accordingly sold off every thing, and came to Canada; but by the time that he had arrived in the country, and paid all his expenses, he had little money left, and when he heard from Mr. Emmerson the terms offered by Mr. Campbell, he gladly accepted them.</s> <s sid="34" id="canada.c36.s34">The wife, his two sons and his daughter, who came with him, were as industrious and as respectable as himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="canada.c36.p11"><s sid="35" id="canada.c36.s35">The second family, of the name of Graves, consisted of a man and his wife, and only one son, a young man grown up; but the wife's two sisters were with them.</s> <s sid="36" id="canada.c36.s36">He had come from Buckinghamshire, and had been accustomed to a dairy farm.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="canada.c36.p12"><s sid="37" id="canada.c36.s37">The third family was a very numerous one, with a man and his wife, of the name of Jackson; these had been farmers and market-gardeners near London; and had brought out some money with them: but, as I have mentioned, they had a very large family, most of them too young to be very useful for a few years.</s> <s sid="38" id="canada.c36.s38">They had seven children: a girl of eighteen, two boys of twelve and thirteen, then three little girls, and a boy an infant.</s> <s sid="39" id="canada.c36.s39">Jackson had money enough to purchase a farm, but being a very prudent man, and reflecting that he might not succeed at first, and that his large family would run away with all his means, he decided upon accepting the terms proposed by Mr. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c36.p13"><s sid="40" id="canada.c36.s40">The fourth and last of the emigrant families was a young couple of the name of Meredith.</s> <s sid="41" id="canada.c36.s41">The husband was the son of a farmer in Shropshire, who had died, and divided his property between his three sons: two of them remained upon the farm and paid the youngest brother his proportion in money, who, being of a speculative turn, resolved to come to Canada, and try his fortune.</s> <s sid="42" id="canada.c36.s42">He married just before he came out, and was not as yet encumbered with any family; he was a fine young man, well educated, and his wife a very clever, pretty young woman.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="canada.c37.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="canada.c37.s2"><qs/>"But what cause could he have?"<qe/> said Emma, weeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="canada.c37.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="canada.c37.s3"><qs/>"Merely to get powder and shot as a reward for bringing her back again,"<qe/><sss/> replied Alfred; <sse/><qs/>"so there is not any thing to fear as to her being ill-treated; but if he has any other reason for what he has done, it is well known that an Indian always respects a female.</s> <s sid="4" id="canada.c37.s4">But here comes my horse."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="canada.c37.p4" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="canada.c37.s5"><qs/>"But what are you going to do, Alfred?"<qe/> said Mrs. Campbell, who was in a state of great agitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="canada.c37.p5" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="canada.c37.s6"><qs/>"Ride to the fort for assistance, bring Captain Sinclair, and go in pursuit as fast as we can, mother.</s> <s sid="7" id="canada.c37.s7">Martin will get all ready by my return, Malachi is following up the trail with Strawberry.</s> <s sid="8" id="canada.c37.s8">But there is no time to be lost; I shall soon be back."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="canada.c37.p6"><s sid="9" id="canada.c37.s9">Alfred then sprang upon his horse, which Martin had brought to the door, and galloped away to the fort.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="canada.c37.p7"><s sid="10" id="canada.c37.s10">As it may be supposed, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Emma were in great distress; this did not, however, prevent them from listening to Martin, and supplying him with all that he requested, which was salt pork and other food for their journey, powder and shot for their rifles, etc.</s> <s sid="11" id="canada.c37.s11">Having specified all that was wanted, Martin then went off to summon young Graves and Meredith; they were soon found, and when they heard the intelligence, were ready in a minute for departure.</s> <s sid="12" id="canada.c37.s12">Their rifles and an extra pair of moccasins each was all that they required for the journey, and in a few minutes they accompanied Martin to the house.</s> <s sid="13" id="canada.c37.s13">After they had been occupied for a little time in dividing the various articles into different packages, that each might carry his proportion, Mr. Campbell said--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="canada.c37.p8" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="canada.c37.s14"><qs/>"Martin, supposing that you and Malachi are correct in your supposition, where do you think that they will take my poor niece?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="canada.c37.p9" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="canada.c37.s15"><qs/>"Right away to their own wigwams, sir,"<qe/> replied Martin.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="canada.c37.p13" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="canada.c37.s19"><qs/>"As far as a stout man can walk in a day, ma'am."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="canada.c37.p15" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="canada.c37.s21"><qs/>"Why, yes, ma'am; I don't see how it can be otherwise; I don't know of the Indians having any horses, although they may have."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="canada.c37.p16" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="canada.c37.s22"><qs/>"But she can not walk as far as a man,"<qe/> replied Mrs. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="canada.c37.p17" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="canada.c37.s23"><qs/>"No, ma'am, and so I suppose they will be twenty days going instead of twelve."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="canada.c37.p18" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="canada.c37.s24"><qs/>"Will they ill-treat or ill-use her, Martin?"<qe/> said Emma.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="canada.c37.p21" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="canada.c37.s27"><qs/>"We shan't ask their leave, miss,"<qe/><sss/> replied Martin; <sse/><qs/>"we shall take her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="canada.c37.p22" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="canada.c37.s28"><qs/>"But not without bloodshed, Martin,"<qe/> said Mrs. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="canada.c37.p23" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="canada.c37.s29"><qs/>"No, ma'am, certainly not without bloodshed, for either the Indians must destroy us or we them; if we conquer, not an Indian will be left alive; and if they master us, it will be about the same thing, I suppose."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="canada.c37.p24" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="canada.c37.s30"><qs/>"Heaven protect us, but this is dreadful; I was prepared for difficulties and annoyances when I came out here,"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Mrs. Campbell; <sse/><qs/>"but not for such trials as these."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="canada.c37.p25" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="canada.c37.s31"><qs/>"Never fear but we'll bring her back, ma'am,"<qe/><sss/> said Martin; <sse/><qs/>"Malachi is a better Indian than them all, and he'll circumvent them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="canada.c37.p26" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="canada.c37.s32"><qs/>"How do you mean?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="canada.c37.p27" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="canada.c37.s33"><qs/>"I mean, ma'am, that we will, if possible, fall upon them unawares, and then we'll have the advantage, for half of them will be killed before they know that they are attacked; we'll fight them Indian fashion, ma'am."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="canada.c37.p28"><s sid="34" id="canada.c37.s34">Mrs. Campbell continued her interrogations till Alfred was seen at the end of the prairie returning at full speed, accompanied by Captain Sinclair and two other men, also on horseback.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="canada.c37.p29" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="canada.c37.s35"><qs/>"Here they come,"<qe/><sss/> said Martin; <sse/><qs/>"and they have lost no time, that's certain."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="canada.c37.p30" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="canada.c37.s36"><qs/>"Poor Captain Sinclair? what must be his feelings!</s> <s sid="37" id="canada.c37.s37">I pity him,"<qe/> said Mrs. Campbell.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="canada.c37.p31" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="canada.c37.s38"><qs/>"He must take it coolly, nevertheless,"<qe/><sss/> observed Martin; <sse/><qs/>"or he may do more harm than good."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="canada.c37.p32"><s sid="39" id="canada.c37.s39">Alfred and Captain Sinclair now dismounted: they had brought with them two of the soldiers who were well used to the woods, and excellent shots with the rifle.</s> <s sid="40" id="canada.c37.s40">A hurried conversation of a few minutes took place, but time was too precious, and Alfred, embracing his father and mother, who, as they shook hands with Captain Sinclair, expressed in a melancholy way their hopes for their success, the party of seven which had been collected set off to rejoin Malachi and the Strawberry.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="canada.c37.p33"><s sid="41" id="canada.c37.s41">Malachi and Strawberry had not been idle; the latter had run back to their lodge and procured a bow and arrows, and since that they had tracked the footmarks through the forest for more than a mile, when they had come to a small rivulet which ran through the forest.</s> <s sid="42" id="canada.c37.s42">Here the trail was lost, at least it was not to be perceived any where on the opposite side of the rivulet, and it was to be presumed that, to conceal their trail, the Indians had walked in the water, either up or down, for a certain distance before they put their feet on the other side; but as it was near the time that they might expect the arrival of Alfred and the others, Malachi had returned to the spot where Alfred and Martin had left them, leaving the Strawberry to walk down and up the side of the rivulet to recover the trail.</s> <s sid="43" id="canada.c37.s43">As soon as the party joined him, they and Malachi set off to where the trail had been lost, and the latter had left the Strawberry.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="canada.c37.p34"><s sid="44" id="canada.c37.s44">There they waited some time, as the Strawberry was not in sight, and they took this opportunity of distributing the provisions and ammunition among them.</s> <s sid="45" id="canada.c37.s45">Captain Sinclair, although his feelings may well be imagined, was very active in arrangements, and showed that, if his heart was smitten, his head was clear.</s> <s sid="46" id="canada.c37.s46">The order of the march was settled by Malachi and him, and as soon as all was arranged, they waited impatiently for the return of the Indian girl; she came at last, and informed them that she had recovered the trail about three miles up the course of the stream, and they all started immediately.</s> <s sid="47" id="canada.c37.s47">As was agreed, they kept perfect silence, and followed the newly-discovered trail for about a mile, when, on their arrival at a clear spot in the woods, where the grass was very short and dry, they were again at fault.</s> <s sid="48" id="canada.c37.s48">They went over to the other side of this heath, to see if they could again fall in with it, but after half-an-hour's search, could not discover it, when they were summoned by a low whistle from the Strawberry, who had returned to the spot where the trail had been lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="canada.c37.p35" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="canada.c37.s49"><qs/>"They have turned back again,"<qe/><sls/> said the Strawberry, pointing to the former footmarks; <sle/><qs/>"see, the track of the moccasins is both ways."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="canada.c37.p36" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="canada.c37.s50"><qs/>"That's true,"<qe/><sls/> said Malachi, after a close examination; <sle/><qs/>"now then, Strawberry, to find out where they have left the old trail again.</s> <s sid="51" id="canada.c37.s51">I told you, sir,"<qe/><sss/> continued Malachi to Alfred, <sse/><qs/>"that the Strawberry would be useful; she has the eye of a falcon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="canada.c37.p37"><s sid="52" id="canada.c37.s52">It was not till another half-hour had elapsed that the spot where they had left the trail, which, to deceive those who might pursue them, the Indians had returned upon, was discovered, and then they started again, and proceeded with caution, led by the Strawberry, until she stopped and spoke to Malachi in the Indian tongue, pointing at a small twig broken upon one of the bushes.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="canada.c37.p38" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="canada.c37.s53"><qs/>"That's true, let us see if it happens again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="canada.c37.p39"><s sid="54" id="canada.c37.s54">In a few moments the Strawberry pointed out another.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="canada.c37.p40" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="canada.c37.s55"><qs/>"Then all's right,"<qe/><sss/> said Malachi, <sse/><qs/>"I said that she could help us again if she chose, and so she has.</s> <s sid="56" id="canada.c37.s56">The Indian woman who wrote the letter,"<qe/><sls/> continued Malachi, turning to Captain Sinclair and Alfred, <sle/><qs/>"is our friend still.</s> <s sid="57" id="canada.c37.s57">See, sir, she has, wherever she has dared to do it without being seen by the Indians, broken down a small twig as a guide to us.</s> <s sid="58" id="canada.c37.s58">Now, if she has continued to do this, we shall not have much trouble."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="canada.c37.p41"><s sid="59" id="canada.c37.s59">They continued their course through the woods until the sun went down, and they could see no longer, having made a journey of about nine miles from the settlement.</s> <s sid="60" id="canada.c37.s60">They then lay down for the night under a large tree; the weather was very warm, and they did not light a fire, as they had some cooked provisions.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="canada.c37.p42"><s sid="61" id="canada.c37.s61">The next morning, as soon as it was daylight, they made a hasty meal, and resumed their task.</s> <s sid="62" id="canada.c37.s62">The trail was now pretty clear, and was occasionally verified by the breaking of a twig, as before.</s> <s sid="63" id="canada.c37.s63">This day they made sixteen miles' journey, and at the close of it they arrived at the borders of a lake about ten miles long, and from one-and-a-half to two wide; the trail went right on to the shore of the lake, and then disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="canada.c37.p43" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="canada.c37.s64"><qs/>"Here they must have taken to the water,"<qe/><sss/> said Alfred; <sse/><qs/>"but what means have they had to cross?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="canada.c37.p44" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="canada.c37.s65"><qs/>"That we must discover, somehow or another, sir,"<qe/><sss/> replied Malachi, <sse/><qs/>"or else we shall not find the trail again; perhaps, however, we shall see to-morrow morning; it is too dark now to attempt to find out, and we may do more harm than good by tracking down the bank.</s> <s sid="66" id="canada.c37.s66">We must bring to for the night.</s> <s sid="67" id="canada.c37.s67">There is a high rock there on the beach further up, we had better go there, as we can light a fire behind the rock without being discovered by it, supposing the Indians are on the opposite shore; and to-night we must cook all our provisions if we possibly can, for, depend upon it, we have traveled faster to-day than they can have done with the young lady, and if we can once get well on the trail again, we shall soon be up with them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="canada.c37.p45" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="canada.c37.s68"><qs/>"God grant that we may!"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Captain Sinclair; <sse/><qs/>"the idea of what poor Mary must suffer, almost drives me mad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="canada.c37.p46" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="canada.c37.s69"><qs/>"Yes, sir, she will be terribly foot-sore, I have no doubt,"<qe/><sss/> replied Malachi, <sse/><qs/>"but the Indians will not treat her ill, depend upon it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="canada.c37.p47"><s sid="70" id="canada.c37.s70">Captain Sinclair sighed, but made no reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="canada.c37.p48"><s sid="71" id="canada.c37.s71">As soon as they arrived at the mass of rock which Malachi had pointed out, they all commenced collecting fire-wood, and the Strawberry in a few minutes had a sufficient fire for their purpose.</s> <s sid="72" id="canada.c37.s72">They had not any cooking utensils with them, but the pork was cut in slices, and stuck upon the ends of small sticks round the fire, until it was sufficiently cooked, and then it was packed up again in parcels, with the exception of what was retained for their supper.</s> <s sid="73" id="canada.c37.s73">They had finished their meal, and were sitting round the embers of the fire, conversing, and calculating the probabilities as to their overtaking the Indians, when Martin sprang up, with his rifle ready to bring to his shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="canada.c37.p49" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="canada.c37.s74"><qs/>"What is it?"<qe/> said Alfred in a low tone, as Martin held up his finger as a sign for silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="canada.c37.p50" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="canada.c37.s75"><qs/>"There's somebody coming this way--he is behind that large tree,"<qe/><sss/> said Martin; <sse/><qs/>"I see his head now, but it is too dark to make out who it may be."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="canada.c37.p51"><s sid="76" id="canada.c37.s76">As Martin said this, a low and singular sort of whistle between the teeth was heard, upon which the Strawberry gently put down Martin's rifle with her hand, saying,</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="canada.c37.p53" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="canada.c37.s78"><qs/>"John! impossible,"<qe/> said Alfred.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="canada.c37.p54" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="canada.c37.s79"><qs/>"It is,"<qe/> replied Strawberry.</s> <s sid="80" id="canada.c37.s80"><qs/>"I know well that whistle.</s> <s sid="81" id="canada.c37.s81">I go to fetch him.</s> <s sid="82" id="canada.c37.s82">I have no fear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="canada.c37.p55"><s sid="83" id="canada.c37.s83">Strawberry stepped out from the group, and went up to the tree, calling John softly by name, and in a few seconds afterward returned, leading John by the hand, who, without saying a word, quietly seated himself down by the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="canada.c37.p59" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="canada.c37.s87"><qs/>"Yesterday,"<qe/><sss/> replied John, <sse/><qs/>"when I came back."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="canada.c37.p63" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="canada.c37.s92"><qs/>"No,"<qe/> replied John, with his mouth full.</s> </p>
