<p pid="1" id="moonstone.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="moonstone.c2.s1">One of the wildest of these stories related to a Yellow Diamond--a famous gem in the native annals of India.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="moonstone.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="moonstone.c2.s2">The earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in the forehead of the four-handed Indian god who typifies the Moon.</s> <s sid="3" id="moonstone.c2.s3">Partly from its peculiar colour, partly from a superstition which represented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned, and growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon, it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to this day--the name of THE MOONSTONE.</s> <s sid="4" id="moonstone.c2.s4">A similar superstition was once prevalent, as I have heard, in ancient Greece and Rome; not applying, however (as in India), to a diamond devoted to the service of a god, but to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems, supposed to be affected by the lunar influences--the moon, in this latter case also, giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our own time.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="moonstone.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="moonstone.c2.s5">The adventures of the Yellow Diamond begin with the eleventh century of the Christian era.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="moonstone.c2.p4"><s sid="6" id="moonstone.c2.s6">At that date, the Mohammedan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni, crossed India; seized on the holy city of Somnauth; and stripped of its treasures the famous temple, which had stood for centuries--the shrine of Hindoo pilgrimage, and the wonder of the Eastern world.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="moonstone.c2.p5"><s sid="7" id="moonstone.c2.s7">Of all the deities worshipped in the temple, the moon-god alone escaped the rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans.</s> <s sid="8" id="moonstone.c2.s8">Preserved by three Brahmins, the inviolate deity, bearing the Yellow Diamond in its forehead, was removed by night, and was transported to the second of the sacred cities of India--the city of Benares.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="moonstone.c2.p6"><s sid="9" id="moonstone.c2.s9">Here, in a new shrine--in a hall inlaid with precious stones, under a roof supported by pillars of gold--the moon-god was set up and worshipped.</s> <s sid="10" id="moonstone.c2.s10">Here, on the night when the shrine was completed, Vishnu the Preserver appeared to the three Brahmins in a dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="moonstone.c2.p7"><s sid="11" id="moonstone.c2.s11">The deity breathed the breath of his divinity on the Diamond in the forehead of the god.</s> <s sid="12" id="moonstone.c2.s12">And the Brahmins knelt and hid their faces in their robes.</s> <s sid="13" id="moonstone.c2.s13">The deity commanded that the Moonstone should be watched, from that time forth, by three priests in turn, night and day, to the end of the generations of men.</s> <s sid="14" id="moonstone.c2.s14">And the Brahmins heard, and bowed before his will.</s> <s sid="15" id="moonstone.c2.s15">The deity predicted certain disaster to the presumptuous mortal who laid hands on the sacred gem, and to all of his house and name who received it after him.</s> <s sid="16" id="moonstone.c2.s16">And the Brahmins caused the prophecy to be written over the gates of the shrine in letters of gold.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="moonstone.c2.p8"><s sid="17" id="moonstone.c2.s17">One age followed another--and still, generation after generation, the successors of the three Brahmins watched their priceless Moonstone, night and day.</s> <s sid="18" id="moonstone.c2.s18">One age followed another until the first years of the eighteenth Christian century saw the reign of Aurungzebe, Emperor of the Moguls.</s> <s sid="19" id="moonstone.c2.s19">At his command havoc and rapine were let loose once more among the temples of the worship of Brahmah.</s> <s sid="20" id="moonstone.c2.s20">The shrine of the four-handed god was polluted by the slaughter of sacred animals; the images of the deities were broken in pieces; and the Moonstone was seized by an officer of rank in the army of Aurungzebe.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="moonstone.c2.p9"><s sid="21" id="moonstone.c2.s21">Powerless to recover their lost treasure by open force, the three guardian priests followed and watched it in disguise.</s> <s sid="22" id="moonstone.c2.s22">The generations succeeded each other; the warrior who had committed the sacrilege perished miserably; the Moonstone passed (carrying its curse with it) from one lawless Mohammedan hand to another; and still, through all chances and changes, the successors of the three guardian priests kept their watch, waiting the day when the will of Vishnu the Preserver should restore to them their sacred gem.</s> <s sid="23" id="moonstone.c2.s23">Time rolled on from the first to the last years of the eighteenth Christian century.</s> <s sid="24" id="moonstone.c2.s24">The Diamond fell into the possession of Tippoo, Sultan of Seringapatam, who caused it to be placed as an ornament in the handle of a dagger, and who commanded it to be kept among the choicest treasures of his armoury.</s> <s sid="25" id="moonstone.c2.s25">Even then--in the palace of the Sultan himself--the three guardian priests still kept their watch in secret.</s> <s sid="26" id="moonstone.c2.s26">There were three officers of Tippoo's household, strangers to the rest, who had won their master's confidence by conforming, or appearing to conform, to the Mussulman faith; and to those three men report pointed as the three priests in disguise.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="moonstone.c3.p5"><s sid="21" id="moonstone.c3.s21">I got to an open door, and saw the bodies of two Indians (by their dress, as I guessed, officers of the palace) lying across the entrance, dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="moonstone.c11.p6"><s sid="40" id="moonstone.c11.s40">It was plain to me from this, that Mr. Franklin thought his father's notion about the Colonel hasty and wrong.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="moonstone.c11.p9" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="moonstone.c11.s46"><qs/>"So much,"<qe/><sss/> I thought to myself, <sse/><qs/>"for a foreign education!</s> <s sid="47" id="moonstone.c11.s47">He has learned that way of girding at us in France, I suppose."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="moonstone.c59.p1"><s sid="1" id="moonstone.c59.s1">As to your cousin's death, then, first.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="moonstone.c59.p2"><s sid="2" id="moonstone.c59.s2">It appears to be established, beyond any reasonable doubt, that he was killed (while he was asleep, or immediately on his waking) by being smothered with a pillow from his bed--that the persons guilty of murdering him are the three Indians--and that the object contemplated (and achieved) by the crime, was to obtain possession of the diamond, called the Moonstone.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="moonstone.c59.p3"><s sid="3" id="moonstone.c59.s3">The facts from which this conclusion is drawn, are derived partly from an examination of the room at the tavern; and partly from the evidence obtained at the Coroner's Inquest.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="moonstone.c59.p4"><s sid="4" id="moonstone.c59.s4">On forcing the door of the room, the deceased gentleman was discovered, dead, with the pillow of the bed over his face.</s> <s sid="5" id="moonstone.c59.s5">The medical man who examined him, being informed of this circumstance, considered the post-mortem appearances as being perfectly compatible with murder by smothering--that is to say, with murder committed by some person, or persons, pressing the pillow over the nose and mouth of the deceased, until death resulted from congestion of the lungs.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="moonstone.c59.p5"><s sid="6" id="moonstone.c59.s6">Next, as to the motive for the crime.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="moonstone.c59.p6"><s sid="7" id="moonstone.c59.s7">A small box, with a sealed paper torn off from it (the paper containing an inscription) was found open, and empty, on a table in the room.</s> <s sid="8" id="moonstone.c59.s8">Mr. Luker has himself personally identified the box, the seal, and the inscription.</s> <s sid="9" id="moonstone.c59.s9">He has declared that the box did actually contain the diamond, called the Moonstone; and he has admitted having given the box (thus sealed up) to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite (then concealed under a disguise), on the afternoon of the twenty-sixth of June last.</s> <s sid="10" id="moonstone.c59.s10">The fair inference from all this is, that the stealing of the Moonstone was the motive of the crime.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="moonstone.c59.p7"><s sid="11" id="moonstone.c59.s11">Next, as to the manner in which the crime was committed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="moonstone.c59.p8"><s sid="12" id="moonstone.c59.s12">On examination of the room (which is only seven feet high), a trap-door in the ceiling, leading out on to the roof of the house, was discovered open.</s> <s sid="13" id="moonstone.c59.s13">The short ladder, used for obtaining access to the trap-door (and kept under the bed), was found placed at the opening, so as to enable any person or persons, in the room, to leave it again easily.</s> <s sid="14" id="moonstone.c59.s14">In the trap-door itself was found a square aperture cut in the wood, apparently with some exceedingly sharp instrument, just behind the bolt which fastened the door on the inner side.</s> <s sid="15" id="moonstone.c59.s15">In this way, any person from the outside could have drawn back the bolt, and opened the door, and have dropped (or have been noiselessly lowered by an accomplice) into the room--its height, as already observed, being only seven feet.</s> <s sid="16" id="moonstone.c59.s16">That some person, or persons, must have got admission in this way, appears evident from the fact of the aperture being there.</s> <s sid="17" id="moonstone.c59.s17">As to the manner in which he (or they) obtained access to the roof of the tavern, it is to be remarked that the third house, lower down in the street, was empty, and under repair--that a long ladder was left by the workmen, leading from the pavement to the top of the house--and that, on returning to their work, on the morning of the 27th, the men found the plank which they had tied to the ladder, to prevent anyone from using it in their absence, removed, and lying on the ground.</s> <s sid="18" id="moonstone.c59.s18">As to the possibility of ascending by this ladder, passing over the roofs of the houses, passing back, and descending again, unobserved--it is discovered, on the evidence of the night policeman, that he only passes through Shore Lane twice in an hour, when out on his beat.</s> <s sid="19" id="moonstone.c59.s19">The testimony of the inhabitants also declares, that Shore Lane, after midnight, is one of the quietest and loneliest streets in London.</s> <s sid="20" id="moonstone.c59.s20">Here again, therefore, it seems fair to infer that--with ordinary caution, and presence of mind--any man, or men, might have ascended by the ladder, and might have descended again, unobserved.</s> <s sid="21" id="moonstone.c59.s21">Once on the roof of the tavern, it has been proved, by experiment, that a man might cut through the trap-door, while lying down on it, and that in such a position, the parapet in front of the house would conceal him from the view of anyone passing in the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="moonstone.c59.p9"><s sid="22" id="moonstone.c59.s22">Lastly, as to the person, or persons, by whom the crime was committed.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="moonstone.c59.p10"><s sid="23" id="moonstone.c59.s23">It is known (1) that the Indians had an interest in possessing themselves of the Diamond.</s> <s sid="24" id="moonstone.c59.s24">(2) It is at least probable that the man looking like an Indian, whom Octavius Guy saw at the window of the cab, speaking to the man dressed like a mechanic, was one of the three Hindoo conspirators.</s> <s sid="25" id="moonstone.c59.s25">(3) It is certain that this same man dressed like a mechanic, was seen keeping Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite in view, all through the evening of the 26th, and was found in the bedroom (before Mr. Ablewhite was shown into it) under circumstances which lead to the suspicion that he was examining the room.</s> <s sid="26" id="moonstone.c59.s26">(4) A morsel of torn gold thread was picked up in the bedroom, which persons expert in such matters, declare to be of Indian manufacture, and to be a species of gold thread not known in England.</s> <s sid="27" id="moonstone.c59.s27">(5) On the morning of the 27th, three men, answering to the description of the three Indians, were observed in Lower Thames Street, were traced to the Tower Wharf, and were seen to leave London by the steamer bound for Rotterdam.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="moonstone.c59.p11"><s sid="28" id="moonstone.c59.s28">There is here, moral, if not legal, evidence, that the murder was committed by the Indians.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="moonstone.c59.p12"><s sid="29" id="moonstone.c59.s29">Whether the man personating a mechanic was, or was not, an accomplice in the crime, it is impossible to say.</s> <s sid="30" id="moonstone.c59.s30">That he could have committed the murder alone, seems beyond the limits of probability.</s> <s sid="31" id="moonstone.c59.s31">Acting by himself, he could hardly have smothered Mr. Ablewhite--who was the taller and stronger man of the two--without a struggle taking place, or a cry being heard.</s> <s sid="32" id="moonstone.c59.s32">A servant girl, sleeping in the next room, heard nothing.</s> <s sid="33" id="moonstone.c59.s33">The landlord, sleeping in the room below, heard nothing.</s> <s sid="34" id="moonstone.c59.s34">The whole evidence points to the inference that more than one man was concerned in this crime--and the circumstances, I repeat, morally justify the conclusion that the Indians committed it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="moonstone.c59.p13"><s sid="35" id="moonstone.c59.s35">I have only to add, that the verdict at the Coroner's Inquest was Wilful Murder against some person, or persons, unknown.</s> <s sid="36" id="moonstone.c59.s36">Mr. Ablewhite's family have offered a reward, and no effort has been left untried to discover the guilty persons.</s> <s sid="37" id="moonstone.c59.s37">The man dressed like a mechanic has eluded all inquiries.</s> <s sid="38" id="moonstone.c59.s38">The Indians have been traced.</s> <s sid="39" id="moonstone.c59.s39">As to the prospect of ultimately capturing these last, I shall have a word to say to you on that head, when I reach the end of the present Report.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="moonstone.c60.p3"><s sid="4" id="moonstone.c60.s4">My investigations in the villa have shown me several fine pictures and statues; furniture tastefully selected, and admirably made; and a conservatory of the rarest flowers, the match of which it would not be easy to find in all London.</s> <s sid="5" id="moonstone.c60.s5">My investigation of the lady has resulted in the discovery of jewels which are worthy to take rank with the flowers, and of carriages and horses which have (deservedly) produced a sensation in the Park, among persons well qualified to judge of the build of the one, and the breed of the others.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="moonstone.c60.p4"><s sid="6" id="moonstone.c60.s6">All this is, so far, common enough.</s> <s sid="7" id="moonstone.c60.s7">The villa and the lady are such familiar objects in London life, that I ought to apologise for introducing them to notice.</s> <s sid="8" id="moonstone.c60.s8">But what is not common and not familiar (in my experience), is that all these fine things were not only ordered, but paid for.</s> <s sid="9" id="moonstone.c60.s9">The pictures, the statues, the flowers, the jewels, the carriages, and the horses--inquiry proved, to my indescribable astonishment, that not a sixpence of debt was owing on any of them.</s> <s sid="10" id="moonstone.c60.s10">As to the villa, it had been bought, out and out, and settled on the lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="moonstone.c67.p5"><s sid="10" id="moonstone.c67.s10">In the wild regions of Kattiawar (and how wild they are, you will understand, when I tell you that even the husbandmen plough the land, armed to the teeth), the population is fanatically devoted to the old Hindoo religion--to the ancient worship of Bramah and Vishnu.</s> <s sid="11" id="moonstone.c67.s11">The few Mahometan families, thinly scattered about the villages in the interior, are afraid to taste meat of any kind.</s> <s sid="12" id="moonstone.c67.s12">A Mahometan even suspected of killing that sacred animal, the cow, is, as a matter of course, put to death without mercy in these parts by the pious Hindoo neighbours who surround him.</s> <s sid="13" id="moonstone.c67.s13">To strengthen the religious enthusiasm of the people, two of the most famous shrines of Hindoo pilgrimage are contained within the boundaries of Kattiawar.</s> <s sid="14" id="moonstone.c67.s14">One of them is Dwarka, the birthplace of the god Krishna.</s> <s sid="15" id="moonstone.c67.s15">The other is the sacred city of Somnauth--sacked, and destroyed as long since as the eleventh century, by the Mahometan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="moonstone.c67.p6"><s sid="16" id="moonstone.c67.s16">Finding myself, for the second time, in these romantic regions, I resolved not to leave Kattiawar, without looking once more on the magnificent desolation of Somnauth.</s> <s sid="17" id="moonstone.c67.s17">At the place where I planned to do this, I was (as nearly as I could calculate it) some three days distant, journeying on foot, from the sacred city.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="moonstone.c67.p7"><s sid="18" id="moonstone.c67.s18">I had not been long on the road, before I noticed that other people--by twos and threes--appeared to be travelling in the same direction as myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="moonstone.c67.p8"><s sid="19" id="moonstone.c67.s19">To such of these as spoke to me, I gave myself out as a Hindoo-Boodhist, from a distant province, bound on a pilgrimage.</s> <s sid="20" id="moonstone.c67.s20">It is needless to say that my dress was of the sort to carry out this description.</s> <s sid="21" id="moonstone.c67.s21">Add, that I know the language as well as I know my own, and that I am lean enough and brown enough to make it no easy matter to detect my European origin--and you will understand that I passed muster with the people readily: not as one of themselves, but as a stranger from a distant part of their own country.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="moonstone.c67.p9"><s sid="22" id="moonstone.c67.s22">On the second day, the number of Hindoos travelling in my direction had increased to fifties and hundreds.</s> <s sid="23" id="moonstone.c67.s23">On the third day, the throng had swollen to thousands; all slowly converging to one point--the city of Somnauth.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="moonstone.c67.p10"><s sid="24" id="moonstone.c67.s24">A trifling service which I was able to render to one of my fellow-pilgrims, during the third day's journey, proved the means of introducing me to certain Hindoos of the higher caste.</s> <s sid="25" id="moonstone.c67.s25">From these men I learnt that the multitude was on its way to a great religious ceremony, which was to take place on a hill at a little distance from Somnauth.</s> <s sid="26" id="moonstone.c67.s26">The ceremony was in honour of the god of the Moon; and it was to be held at night.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="moonstone.c67.p11"><s sid="27" id="moonstone.c67.s27">The crowd detained us as we drew near to the place of celebration.</s> <s sid="28" id="moonstone.c67.s28">By the time we reached the hill the moon was high in the heaven.</s> <s sid="29" id="moonstone.c67.s29">My Hindoo friends possessed some special privileges which enabled them to gain access to the shrine.</s> <s sid="30" id="moonstone.c67.s30">They kindly allowed me to accompany them.</s> <s sid="31" id="moonstone.c67.s31">When we arrived at the place, we found the shrine hidden from our view by a curtain hung between two magnificent trees.</s> <s sid="32" id="moonstone.c67.s32">Beneath the trees a flat projection of rock jutted out, and formed a species of natural platform.</s> <s sid="33" id="moonstone.c67.s33">Below this, I stood, in company with my Hindoo friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="moonstone.c67.p12"><s sid="34" id="moonstone.c67.s34">Looking back down the hill, the view presented the grandest spectacle of Nature and Man, in combination, that I have ever seen.</s> <s sid="35" id="moonstone.c67.s35">The lower slopes of the eminence melted imperceptibly into a grassy plain, the place of the meeting of three rivers.</s> <s sid="36" id="moonstone.c67.s36">On one side, the graceful winding of the waters stretched away, now visible, now hidden by trees, as far as the eye could see.</s> <s sid="37" id="moonstone.c67.s37">On the other, the waveless ocean slept in the calm of the night.</s> <s sid="38" id="moonstone.c67.s38">People this lovely scene with tens of thousands of human creatures, all dressed in white, stretching down the sides of the hill, overflowing into the plain, and fringing the nearer banks of the winding rivers.</s> <s sid="39" id="moonstone.c67.s39">Light this halt of the pilgrims by the wild red flames of cressets and torches, streaming up at intervals from every part of the innumerable throng.</s> <s sid="40" id="moonstone.c67.s40">Imagine the moonlight of the East, pouring in unclouded glory over all--and you will form some idea of the view that met me when I looked forth from the summit of the hill.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="moonstone.c67.p13"><s sid="41" id="moonstone.c67.s41">A strain of plaintive music, played on stringed instruments, and flutes, recalled my attention to the hidden shrine.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="moonstone.c67.p15"><s sid="45" id="moonstone.c67.s45">One of the spectators, near whom I was standing, saw me start.</s> <s sid="46" id="moonstone.c67.s46">In a whisper, he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the platform of rock.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="moonstone.c67.p16"><s sid="47" id="moonstone.c67.s47">They were Brahmins (he said) who had forfeited their caste in the service of the god.</s> <s sid="48" id="moonstone.c67.s48">The god had commanded that their purification should be the purification by pilgrimage.</s> <s sid="49" id="moonstone.c67.s49">On that night, the three men were to part.</s> <s sid="50" id="moonstone.c67.s50">In three separate directions, they were to set forth as pilgrims to the shrines of India.</s> <s sid="51" id="moonstone.c67.s51">Never more were they to look on each other's faces.</s> <s sid="52" id="moonstone.c67.s52">Never more were they to rest on their wanderings, from the day which witnessed their separation, to the day which witnessed their death.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="moonstone.c67.p18"><s sid="62" id="moonstone.c67.s62">A new strain of music, loud and jubilant, rose from the hidden shrine.</s> <s sid="63" id="moonstone.c67.s63">The crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="moonstone.c67.p19"><s sid="64" id="moonstone.c67.s64">The curtain between the trees was drawn aside, and the shrine was disclosed to view.</s> </p>
