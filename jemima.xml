<p pid="36" id="jemima.c1.p36"><s sid="48" id="jemima.c1.s48">He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="jemima.c1.p37"><s sid="49" id="jemima.c1.s49">It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="jemima.c1.p45"><s sid="59" id="jemima.c1.s59">When she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="jemima.c1.p55"><s sid="78" id="jemima.c1.s78">Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.</s> </p>
