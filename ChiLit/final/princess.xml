<p pid="11" id="princess.c1.p11"><s sid="14" id="princess.c1.s14">There was once a little princess whose father was king over a great country full of mountains and valleys.</s> <s sid="15" id="princess.c1.s15">His palace was built upon one of the mountains, and was very grand and beautiful.</s> <s sid="16" id="princess.c1.s16">The princess, whose name was Irene, was born there, but she was sent soon after her birth, because her mother was not very strong, to be brought up by country people in a large house, half castle, half farm-house, on the side of another mountain, about halfway between its base and its peak.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="princess.c1.p12"><s sid="17" id="princess.c1.s17">The princess was a sweet little creature, and at the time my story begins was about eight years old.</s> <s sid="18" id="princess.c1.s18">I think, but she got older very fast.</s> <s sid="19" id="princess.c1.s19">Her face was fair and pretty, with eyes like two bits of night-sky, each with a star dissolved in the blue.</s> <s sid="20" id="princess.c1.s20">Those eyes you would have thought must have known they came from there, so often were they turned up in that direction.</s> <s sid="21" id="princess.c1.s21">The ceiling of her nursery was blue, with stars in it, as like the sky as they could make it.</s> <s sid="22" id="princess.c1.s22">But I doubt if ever she saw the real sky with the stars in it, for a reason which I had better mention at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="princess.c1.p13"><s sid="23" id="princess.c1.s23">These mountains were full of hollow places underneath; huge caverns, and winding ways, some with water running through them, and some shining with all colors of the rainbow when a light was taken in.</s> <s sid="24" id="princess.c1.s24">There would not have been much known about them, had there not been mines there, great deep pits, with long galleries and passages running off from them, which had been dug to get at the ore of which the mountains were full.</s> <s sid="25" id="princess.c1.s25">In the course of digging, the miners came upon many of these natural caverns.</s> <s sid="26" id="princess.c1.s26">A few of them had far-off openings out on the side of a mountain, or into a ravine.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="princess.c1.p14"><s sid="27" id="princess.c1.s27">Now in these subterranean caverns lived a strange race of beings, called by some gnomes, by some kobolds, by some goblins.</s> <s sid="28" id="princess.c1.s28">There was a legend current in the country that at one time they lived above ground, and were very like other people.</s> <s sid="29" id="princess.c1.s29">But for some reason or other, concerning which there were different legendary theories, the king had laid what they thought too severe taxes upon them, or had required observances of them they did not like, or had begun to treat them with more severity in some way or other, and impose stricter laws; and the consequence was that they had all disappeared from the face of the country.</s> <s sid="30" id="princess.c1.s30">According to the legend, however, instead of going to some other country, they had all taken refuge in the subterranean caverns, whence they never came out but at night, and then seldom showed themselves in any numbers, and never to many people at once.</s> <s sid="31" id="princess.c1.s31">It was only in the least frequented and most difficult parts of the mountains that they were said to gather even at night in the open air.</s> <s sid="32" id="princess.c1.s32">Those who had caught sight of any of them said that they had greatly altered in the course of generations; and no wonder, seeing they lived away from the sun, in cold and wet and dark places.</s> <s sid="33" id="princess.c1.s33">They were now, not ordinarily ugly, but either absolutely hideous, or ludicrously grotesque both in face and form.</s> <s sid="34" id="princess.c1.s34">There was no invention, they said, of the most lawless imagination expressed by pen or pencil, that could surpass the extravagance of their appearance.</s> <s sid="35" id="princess.c1.s35">And as they grew mis-shapen in body, they had grown in knowledge and cleverness, and now were able to do things no mortal could see the possibility of.</s> <s sid="36" id="princess.c1.s36">But as they grew in cunning, they grew in mischief, and their great delight was in every way they could think of to annoy the people who lived in the open-air-story above them.</s> <s sid="37" id="princess.c1.s37">They had enough of affection left for each other, to preserve them from being absolutely cruel for cruelty's sake to those that came in their way; but still they so heartily cherished the ancestral grudge against those who occupied their former possession, and especially against the descendants of the king who had caused their expulsion, that they sought every opportunity of tormenting them in ways that were as odd as their inventors; and although dwarfed and mis-shapen, they had strength equal to their cunning.</s> <s sid="38" id="princess.c1.s38">In the process of time they had got a king, and a government of their own, whose chief business, beyond their own simple affairs, was to devise trouble for their neighbors.</s> <s sid="39" id="princess.c1.s39">It will now be pretty evident why the little princess had never seen the sky at night.</s> <s sid="40" id="princess.c1.s40">They were much too afraid of the goblins to let her out of the house then, even in company with ever so many attendants; and they had good reason, as we shall see by-and-by.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="princess.c2.p3"><s sid="14" id="princess.c2.s14">[She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be afraid.]</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="princess.c2.p4"><s sid="15" id="princess.c2.s15">Even that is a change, and the princess wakes up a little, and looks about her.</s> <s sid="16" id="princess.c2.s16">Then she tumbles off her chair, and runs out of the door, not the same door the nurse went out of, but one which opened at the foot of a curious old stair of worm-eaten oak, which looked as if never any one had set foot upon it.</s> <s sid="17" id="princess.c2.s17">She had once before been up six steps, and that was sufficient reason, in such a day, for trying to find out what was at the top of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="princess.c2.p5"><s sid="18" id="princess.c2.s18">Up and up she ran--such a long way it seemed to her! until she came to the top of the third flight.</s> <s sid="19" id="princess.c2.s19">There she found the landing was the end of a long passage.</s> <s sid="20" id="princess.c2.s20">Into this she ran.</s> <s sid="21" id="princess.c2.s21">It was full of doors on each side.</s> <s sid="22" id="princess.c2.s22">There were so many that she did not care to open any, but ran on to the end, where she turned into another passage, also full of doors.</s> <s sid="23" id="princess.c2.s23">When she had turned twice more, and still saw doors and only doors about her, she began to get frightened.</s> <s sid="24" id="princess.c2.s24">It was so silent!</s> <s sid="25" id="princess.c2.s25">And all those doors must hide rooms with nobody in them!</s> <s sid="26" id="princess.c2.s26">That was dreadful.</s> <s sid="27" id="princess.c2.s27">Also the rain made a great trampling noise on the roof.</s> <s sid="28" id="princess.c2.s28">She turned and started at full speed, her little footsteps echoing through the sounds of the rain--back for the stairs and her safe nursery.</s> <s sid="29" id="princess.c2.s29">So she thought, but she had lost herself long ago.</s> <s sid="30" id="princess.c2.s30">It doesn't follow that she _was_ lost, because she had lost herself though.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="princess.c2.p6"><s sid="31" id="princess.c2.s31">She ran for some distance, turned several times, and then began to be afraid.</s> <s sid="32" id="princess.c2.s32">Very soon she was sure that she had lost the way back.</s> <s sid="33" id="princess.c2.s33">Rooms everywhere, and no stair!</s> <s sid="34" id="princess.c2.s34">Her little heart beat as fast as her little feet ran, and a lump of tears was growing in her throat.</s> <s sid="35" id="princess.c2.s35">But she was too eager and perhaps too frightened to cry for some time.</s> <s sid="36" id="princess.c2.s36">At last her hope failed her.</s> <s sid="37" id="princess.c2.s37">Nothing but passages and doors everywhere!</s> <s sid="38" id="princess.c2.s38">She threw herself on the floor, and began to wail and cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="princess.c2.p7"><s sid="39" id="princess.c2.s39">She did not cry long, however, for she was as brave as could be expected of a princess of her age.</s> <s sid="40" id="princess.c2.s40">After a good cry, she got up, and brushed the dust from her frock.</s> <s sid="41" id="princess.c2.s41">Oh what old dust it was!</s> <s sid="42" id="princess.c2.s42">Then she wiped her eyes with her hands, for princesses don't always have their handkerchiefs in their pockets any more than some other little girls I know of.</s> <s sid="43" id="princess.c2.s43">Next, like a true princess, she resolved on going wisely to work to find her way back: she would walk through the passages, and look in every direction for the stair.</s> <s sid="44" id="princess.c2.s44">This she did, but without success.</s> <s sid="45" id="princess.c2.s45">She went over the same ground again and again without knowing it, for the passages and doors were all alike.</s> <s sid="46" id="princess.c2.s46">At last, in a corner, through a half-open door, she did see a stair.</s> <s sid="47" id="princess.c2.s47">But alas! it went the wrong way: instead of going down, it went up.</s> <s sid="48" id="princess.c2.s48">Frightened as she was, however, she could not help wishing to see where yet further the stair could lead.</s> <s sid="49" id="princess.c2.s49">It was very narrow, and so steep that she went up like a four-legged creature on her hands and feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="princess.c20.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="princess.c20.s1">THAT same morning, early, the princess woke in a terrible fright.</s> <s sid="2" id="princess.c20.s2">There was a hideous noise in her room--of creatures snarling and hissing and racketing about as if they were fighting.</s> <s sid="3" id="princess.c20.s3">The moment she came to herself, she remembered something she had never thought of again--what her grandmother told her to do when she was frightened.</s> <s sid="4" id="princess.c20.s4">She immediately took off her ring and put it under her pillow.</s> <s sid="5" id="princess.c20.s5">As she did so, she fancied she felt a finger and thumb take it gently from under her palm.</s> <s sid="6" id="princess.c20.s6"><qs/>"It must be my grandmother!"<qe/> she said to herself, and the thought gave her such courage that she stopped to put on her dainty little slippers before running from the room.</s> <s sid="7" id="princess.c20.s7">While doing this, she caught sight of a long cloak of sky-blue, thrown over the back of a chair by her bedside.</s> <s sid="8" id="princess.c20.s8">She had never seen it before, but it was evidently waiting for her.</s> <s sid="9" id="princess.c20.s9">She put it on, and then, feeling with the forefinger of her right hand, soon found her grandmother's thread, which she proceeded at once to follow, expecting it would lead her straight up the old stair.</s> <s sid="10" id="princess.c20.s10">When she reached the door, she found it went down and ran along the floor, so that she had almost to crawl in order to keep a hold of it.</s> <s sid="11" id="princess.c20.s11">Then, to her surprise, and somewhat to her dismay, she found that instead of leading her toward the stair it turned in quite the opposite direction.</s> <s sid="12" id="princess.c20.s12">It led her through certain narrow passages toward the kitchen, turning aside ere she reached it, and guiding her to a door which communicated with a small back yard.</s> <s sid="13" id="princess.c20.s13">Some of the maids were already up, and this door was standing open.</s> <s sid="14" id="princess.c20.s14">Across the yard the thread still ran along the ground, until it brought her to a door in the wall which opened upon the mountain side.</s> <s sid="15" id="princess.c20.s15">When she had passed through, the thread rose to about half her height, and she could hold it with ease as she walked.</s> <s sid="16" id="princess.c20.s16">It led her straight up the mountain.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="princess.c20.p2"><s sid="17" id="princess.c20.s17">The cause of her alarm was less frightful than she supposed.</s> <s sid="18" id="princess.c20.s18">The cook's great black cat, pursued by the housekeeper's terrier, had bounced against her bedroom door, which had not been properly fastened, and the two had burst into her room together and commenced a battle royal.</s> <s sid="19" id="princess.c20.s19">How the nurse came to sleep through it, was a mystery, but I suspect the old lady had something to do with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="princess.c20.p3"><s sid="20" id="princess.c20.s20">It was a clear warm morning.</s> <s sid="21" id="princess.c20.s21">The wind blew deliciously over the mountain-side.</s> <s sid="22" id="princess.c20.s22">Here and there she saw a late primrose, but she did not stop to call on them.</s> <s sid="23" id="princess.c20.s23">The sky was mottled with small clouds.</s> <s sid="24" id="princess.c20.s24">The sun was not yet up, but some of their fluffy edges had caught his light and hung out orange and gold-colored fringes upon the air.</s> <s sid="25" id="princess.c20.s25">The dew lay in round drops upon the leaves, and hung like tiny diamonds from the blades of grass about her path.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="princess.c20.p4" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="princess.c20.s26"><qs/>"How lovely that bit of gossamer is!"<qe/> thought the princess, looking at a long undulating line that shone at some distance from her up the hill.</s> <s sid="27" id="princess.c20.s27">It was not the time for gossamers though; and Irene soon discovered that it was her own thread she saw shining on before her in the light of the morning.</s> <s sid="28" id="princess.c20.s28">It was leading her she knew not whither; but she had never in her life been out before sunrise, and everything was so fresh and cool and lively and full of something coming, that she felt too happy to be afraid of anything.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="princess.c20.p5"><s sid="29" id="princess.c20.s29">After leading her up a good distance, the thread turned to the left, and down the path upon which she and Lootie had met Curdie.</s> <s sid="30" id="princess.c20.s30">But she never thought of that, for now in the morning light, with its far outlook over the country, no path could have been more open and airy and cheerful.</s> <s sid="31" id="princess.c20.s31">She could see the road almost to the horizon, along which she had so often watched her king-papa and his troop come shining, with the bugle-blast cleaving the air before them; and it was like a companion to her.</s> <s sid="32" id="princess.c20.s32">Down and down the path went, then up, and then down, and then up again, getting rugged and more rugged as it went; still along the path went the silvery thread, and still along the thread went Irene's little rosy-tipped forefinger.</s> <s sid="33" id="princess.c20.s33">By and by she came to a little stream that jabbered and prattled down the hill, and up the side of the stream went both path and thread.</s> <s sid="34" id="princess.c20.s34">And still the path grew rougher and steeper, and the mountain grew wilder, till Irene began to think she was going a very long way from home; and when she turned to look back, she saw that the level country had vanished and the rough bare mountain had closed in about her.</s> <s sid="35" id="princess.c20.s35">But still on went the thread, and on went the princess.</s> <s sid="36" id="princess.c20.s36">Everything around her was getting brighter and brighter as the sun came nearer; till at length his first rays all at once alighted on the top of a rock before her, like some golden creature fresh from the sky.</s> <s sid="37" id="princess.c20.s37">Then she saw that the little stream ran out of a hole in that rock, that the path did not go past the rock, and that the thread was leading her straight up to it.</s> <s sid="38" id="princess.c20.s38">A shudder ran through her from head to foot when she found that the thread was actually taking her into the hole out of which the stream ran.</s> <s sid="39" id="princess.c20.s39">It ran out babbling joyously, but she had to go in.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="princess.c20.p6" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="princess.c20.s40">She did not hesitate.</s> <s sid="41" id="princess.c20.s41">Right into the hole she went, which was high enough to let her walk without stooping.</s> <s sid="42" id="princess.c20.s42">For a little way there was a brown glimmer, but at the first turn it all but ceased, and before she had gone many paces she was in total darkness.</s> <s sid="43" id="princess.c20.s43">Then she began to be frightened indeed.</s> <s sid="44" id="princess.c20.s44">Every moment she kept feeling the thread backward, and as she went farther and farther into the darkness of the great hollow mountain, she kept thinking more and more about her grandmother, and all that she had said to her, and how kind she had been, and how beautiful she was, and all about her lovely room, and the fire of roses, and the great lamp that sent its light through stone walls.</s> <s sid="45" id="princess.c20.s45">And she became more and more sure that the thread could not have gone there of itself, and that her grandmother must have sent it.</s> <s sid="46" id="princess.c20.s46">But it tried her dreadfully when the path went down very steep, and especially when she came to places where she had to go down rough stairs, and even sometimes a ladder.</s> <s sid="47" id="princess.c20.s47">Through one narrow passage after another, over lumps of rock and sand and clay, the thread guided her, until she came to a small hole through which she had to creep.</s> <s sid="48" id="princess.c20.s48">Finding no change on the other side--<qs/>"Shall I ever get back?"<qe/> she thought, over and over again, wondering at herself that she was not ten times more frightened, and often feeling as if she were only walking in the story of a dream.</s> <s sid="49" id="princess.c20.s49">Sometimes she heard the noise of water, a dull gurgling inside the rock.</s> <s sid="50" id="princess.c20.s50">By and by she heard the sounds of blows, which came nearer and nearer; but again they grew duller and almost died away.</s> <s sid="51" id="princess.c20.s51">In a hundred directions she turned, obedient to the guiding thread.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="princess.c20.p7"><s sid="52" id="princess.c20.s52">At last she spied a dull red shine, and came up to the mica-window, and thence away and round about, and right into a cavern, where glowed the red embers of a fire.</s> <s sid="53" id="princess.c20.s53">Here the thread began to rise.</s> <s sid="54" id="princess.c20.s54">It rose as high as her head, and higher still.</s> <s sid="55" id="princess.c20.s55">What _should_ she do if she lost her hold?</s> <s sid="56" id="princess.c20.s56">She was pulling it down!</s> <s sid="57" id="princess.c20.s57">She might break it!</s> <s sid="58" id="princess.c20.s58">She could see it far up, glowing as red as her fire-opal in the light of the embers.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="princess.c20.p8"><s sid="59" id="princess.c20.s59">But presently she came to a huge heap of stones, piled in a slope against the wall of the cavern.</s> <s sid="60" id="princess.c20.s60">On these she climbed, and soon recovered the level of the thread--only however to find, the next moment, that it vanished through the heap of stones, and left her standing on it, with her face to the solid rock.</s> <s sid="61" id="princess.c20.s61">For one terrible moment, she felt as if her grandmother had forsaken her.</s> <s sid="62" id="princess.c20.s62">The thread which the spiders had spun far over the seas, which her grandmother had sat in the moonlight and spun again for her, which she had tempered in the rose-fire, and tied to her opal ring, had left her--had gone where she could no longer follow it--had brought her into a horrible cavern, and there left her!</s> <s sid="63" id="princess.c20.s63">She was forsaken indeed!</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="princess.c20.p9" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="princess.c20.s64"><qs/>"When _shall_ I wake?"<qe/> she said to herself in an agony, but the same moment knew that it was no dream.</s> <s sid="65" id="princess.c20.s65">She threw herself upon the heap, and began to cry.</s> <s sid="66" id="princess.c20.s66">It was well she did not know what creatures, one of them with stone shoes on her feet, were lying in the next cave.</s> <s sid="67" id="princess.c20.s67">But neither did she know who was on the other side of the slab.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="princess.c20.p10"><s sid="68" id="princess.c20.s68">At length the thought struck her, that at least she could follow the thread backward, and thus get out of the mountain, and home.</s> <s sid="69" id="princess.c20.s69">She rose at once, and found the thread.</s> <s sid="70" id="princess.c20.s70">But the instant she tried to feel it backward, it vanished from her touch.</s> <s sid="71" id="princess.c20.s71">Forward, it led her hand up to the heap of stones--backward, it seemed nowhere.</s> <s sid="72" id="princess.c20.s72">Neither could she see it as before in the light of the fire.</s> <s sid="73" id="princess.c20.s73">She burst into a wailing cry, and again threw herself down on the stones.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="princess.c21.p1"><s sid="1" id="princess.c21.s1">AS the princess lay and sobbed, she kept feeling the thread mechanically, following it with her finger many times up the stones in which it disappeared.</s> <s sid="2" id="princess.c21.s2">By and by she began, still mechanically, to poke her finger in after it between the stones as far as she could.</s> <s sid="3" id="princess.c21.s3">All at once it came into her head that she might remove some of the stones and see where the thread went next.</s> <s sid="4" id="princess.c21.s4">Almost laughing at herself for never having thought of this before, she jumped to her feet.</s> <s sid="5" id="princess.c21.s5">Her fear vanished: once more she was certain her grandmother's thread could not have brought her there just to leave her there; and she began to throw away the stones from the top as fast as she could, sometimes two or three at a handful, sometimes taking both hands to lift one.</s> <s sid="6" id="princess.c21.s6">After clearing them away a little, she found that the thread turned and went straight downward.</s> <s sid="7" id="princess.c21.s7">Hence, as the heap sloped a good deal, growing of course wider toward its base, she had to throw away a multitude of stones to follow the thread.</s> <s sid="8" id="princess.c21.s8">But this was not all, for she soon found that the thread, after going straight down for a little way, turned first sideways in one direction, then sideways in another, and then shot, at various angles, hither and thither inside the heap, so that she began to be afraid that to clear the thread, she must remove the whole huge gathering.</s> <s sid="9" id="princess.c21.s9">She was dismayed at the very idea, but, losing no time, set to work with a will; and with aching back, and bleeding fingers and hands, she worked on, sustained by the pleasure of seeing the heap slowly diminish, and begin to show itself on the opposite side of the fire.</s> <s sid="10" id="princess.c21.s10">Another thing which helped to keep up her courage was, that as often as she uncovered a turn of the thread, instead of lying loose upon the stones, it tightened up; this made her sure that her grandmother was at the end of it somewhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="princess.c21.p2"><s sid="11" id="princess.c21.s11">She had got about half way down when she started, and nearly fell with fright.</s> <s sid="12" id="princess.c21.s12">Close to her ear as it seemed, a voice broke out singing--</s> </p>
