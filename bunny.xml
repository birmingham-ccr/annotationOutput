<p pid="2" id="bunny.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="bunny.c1.s2">One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="bunny.c1.p3"><s sid="3" id="bunny.c1.s3">He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="bunny.c1.p4"><s sid="4" id="bunny.c1.s4">A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="bunny.c1.p5"><s sid="5" id="bunny.c1.s5">As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="bunny.c1.p8"><s sid="8" id="bunny.c1.s8">That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="bunny.c1.p9"><s sid="9" id="bunny.c1.s9">Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).</s> <s sid="10" id="bunny.c1.s10">She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="bunny.c1.p10"><s sid="11" id="bunny.c1.s11">Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="bunny.c1.p11"><s sid="12" id="bunny.c1.s12">He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="bunny.c1.p12"><s sid="13" id="bunny.c1.s13">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="bunny.c1.p13"><s sid="14" id="bunny.c1.s14">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="bunny.c1.p14"><s sid="15" id="bunny.c1.s15">Peter was sitting by himself.</s> <s sid="16" id="bunny.c1.s16">He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="bunny.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="bunny.c1.s17"><qs/>"Peter,"<qe/><sls/> said little Benjamin, in a whisper, <sle/><qs/>"who has got your clothes?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="bunny.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="bunny.c1.s18">Peter replied, <qs/>"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"<qe/> and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="bunny.c1.p17"><s sid="19" id="bunny.c1.s19">Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="bunny.c1.p18"><s sid="20" id="bunny.c1.s20">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="bunny.c1.p19"><s sid="21" id="bunny.c1.s21">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="bunny.c1.p20"><s sid="22" id="bunny.c1.s22">Peter said he hoped that it would rain.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="bunny.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="bunny.c1.s23">At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling:</s> <s sid="24" id="bunny.c1.s24"><qs/>"Cotton-tail!</s> <s sid="25" id="bunny.c1.s25">Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="bunny.c1.p22"><s sid="26" id="bunny.c1.s26">Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="bunny.c1.p23"><s sid="27" id="bunny.c1.s27">They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.</s> <s sid="28" id="bunny.c1.s28">From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.</s> <s sid="29" id="bunny.c1.s29">Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="bunny.c1.p24"><s sid="30" id="bunny.c1.s30">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="bunny.c1.p25"><s sid="31" id="bunny.c1.s31">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="bunny.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="bunny.c1.s32">Little Benjamin said:</s> <s sid="33" id="bunny.c1.s33"><qs/>"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="bunny.c1.p27"><s sid="34" id="bunny.c1.s34">Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="bunny.c1.p28"><s sid="35" id="bunny.c1.s35">It had been sown with lettuces.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="bunny.c1.p29"><s sid="36" id="bunny.c1.s36">They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="bunny.c1.p30"><s sid="37" id="bunny.c1.s37">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="bunny.c1.p31"><s sid="38" id="bunny.c1.s38">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="bunny.c1.p32"><s sid="39" id="bunny.c1.s39">Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="bunny.c1.p33"><s sid="40" id="bunny.c1.s40">They took them off the scarecrow.</s> <s sid="41" id="bunny.c1.s41">There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="bunny.c1.p34"><s sid="42" id="bunny.c1.s42">Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="bunny.c1.p35"><s sid="43" id="bunny.c1.s43">Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="bunny.c1.p36"><s sid="44" id="bunny.c1.s44">Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="bunny.c1.p37"><s sid="45" id="bunny.c1.s45">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="bunny.c1.p38"><s sid="46" id="bunny.c1.s46">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="bunny.c1.p39"><s sid="47" id="bunny.c1.s47">Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.</s> <s sid="48" id="bunny.c1.s48">He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="bunny.c1.p40"><s sid="49" id="bunny.c1.s49">(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="bunny.c1.p41"><s sid="50" id="bunny.c1.s50">The lettuces certainly were very fine.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="bunny.c1.p42"><s sid="51" id="bunny.c1.s51">Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.</s> <s sid="52" id="bunny.c1.s52">Presently he dropped half the onions.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="bunny.c1.p43"><s sid="53" id="bunny.c1.s53">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="bunny.c1.p44"><s sid="54" id="bunny.c1.s54">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="bunny.c1.p45"><s sid="55" id="bunny.c1.s55">Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables.</s> <s sid="56" id="bunny.c1.s56">He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.</s> <s sid="57" id="bunny.c1.s57">They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="bunny.c1.p46"><s sid="58" id="bunny.c1.s58">The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="bunny.c1.p47"><s sid="59" id="bunny.c1.s59">Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="bunny.c1.p48"><s sid="60" id="bunny.c1.s60">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="bunny.c1.p49"><s sid="61" id="bunny.c1.s61">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="bunny.c1.p50"><s sid="62" id="bunny.c1.s62">They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs.</s> <s sid="63" id="bunny.c1.s63">Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="bunny.c1.p51"><s sid="64" id="bunny.c1.s64">He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="bunny.c1.p52"><s sid="65" id="bunny.c1.s65">This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="bunny.c1.p53"><s sid="66" id="bunny.c1.s66">Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket....</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="bunny.c1.p54"><s sid="67" id="bunny.c1.s67">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="bunny.c1.p55"><s sid="68" id="bunny.c1.s68">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="bunny.c1.p56"><s sid="69" id="bunny.c1.s69">The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="bunny.c1.p57"><s sid="70" id="bunny.c1.s70">Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="bunny.c1.p58"><s sid="71" id="bunny.c1.s71">Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="bunny.c1.p59"><s sid="72" id="bunny.c1.s72">She sat there for _five hours_.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="bunny.c1.p60"><s sid="73" id="bunny.c1.s73">*       *       *       *       *</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="bunny.c1.p61"><s sid="74" id="bunny.c1.s74">I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="bunny.c1.p62"><s sid="75" id="bunny.c1.s75">The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="bunny.c1.p63"><s sid="76" id="bunny.c1.s76">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="bunny.c1.p64"><s sid="77" id="bunny.c1.s77">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="bunny.c1.p65"><s sid="78" id="bunny.c1.s78">At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="bunny.c1.p66"><s sid="79" id="bunny.c1.s79">The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="bunny.c1.p67"><s sid="80" id="bunny.c1.s80">He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="bunny.c1.p68"><s sid="81" id="bunny.c1.s81">He was looking for his son.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="bunny.c1.p69"><s sid="82" id="bunny.c1.s82">Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="bunny.c1.p70"><s sid="83" id="bunny.c1.s83">He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="bunny.c1.p71"><s sid="84" id="bunny.c1.s84">The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="bunny.c1.p72"><s sid="85" id="bunny.c1.s85">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="bunny.c1.p73"><s sid="86" id="bunny.c1.s86">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="bunny.c1.p74"><s sid="87" id="bunny.c1.s87">When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="bunny.c1.p75"><s sid="88" id="bunny.c1.s88">Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="bunny.c1.p76"><s sid="89" id="bunny.c1.s89">Then he took out his nephew Peter.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="bunny.c1.p77"><s sid="90" id="bunny.c1.s90">Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="bunny.c1.p78"><s sid="91" id="bunny.c1.s91">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="bunny.c1.p79"><s sid="92" id="bunny.c1.s92">When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="bunny.c1.p80"><s sid="93" id="bunny.c1.s93">It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="bunny.c1.p81"><s sid="94" id="bunny.c1.s94">Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up _inside_ the greenhouse, locking the door upon the _outside_.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="bunny.c1.p82"><s sid="95" id="bunny.c1.s95">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="bunny.c1.p83"><s sid="96" id="bunny.c1.s96">[Illustration]</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="bunny.c1.p84"><s sid="97" id="bunny.c1.s97">When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat.</s> <s sid="98" id="bunny.c1.s98">Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco.</s> </p>
