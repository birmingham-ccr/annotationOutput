<p pid="1" id="masterman.c0.p1"><s>CHAPTER ONE.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="masterman.c0.p2"><s>It was in the month of October, 18---, that the _Pacific_, a large ship, was running before a heavy gale of wind in the middle of the vast Atlantic Ocean.</s> <s>She had but little sail, for the wind was so strong, that the canvas would have been split into pieces by the furious blasts before which she was driven through the waves, which were very high, and following her almost as fast as she darted through their boiling waters; sometimes heaving up her stern and sinking her bows down so deep into the hollow of the sea, that it appeared as if she would have dived down underneath the waves; but she was a fine vessel, and the captain was a good seaman, who did what he considered best for the safety of his vessel, and then put his trust in that Providence who is ever watchful over us.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="masterman.c0.p3"><s>The captain stood before the wheel, watching the men who were steering the ship; for when you are running before a heavy gale, it requires great attention to the helm: and as he looked around him and up at the heavens, he sang in a low voice the words of a sea song:</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="masterman.c0.p4"><s>"One wide water all around us, All above us one black sky."</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="masterman.c0.p5"><s>And so it was with them;--they were in the middle of the Atlantic, not another vessel to be seen, and the heavens were covered with black clouds, which were borne along furiously by the gale; the sea ran mountains high, and broke into large white foaming crests, while the fierce wind howled through the rigging of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="masterman.c0.p6"><s>Besides the captain of the ship and the two men at the wheel, there were two other personages on deck: one was a young lad about twelve years old, and the other a weather-beaten old seaman, whose grisly locks were streaming in the wind, as he paced aft and looked over the taffrail of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="masterman.c0.p7" type="speech"><s>The young lad, observing a heavy sea coming up to the stern of the vessel, caught hold of the old man's arm, crying out--<qs/>"Won't that great wave come into us, Ready?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="masterman.c0.p8"><s>"No, Master William, it will not: don't you see how the ship lifts her quarters to it?--and now it has passed underneath us.</s> <s>But it might happen, and then what would become of you, if I did not hold on, and hold you on also?</s> <s>You would be washed overboard."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="masterman.c0.p9"><s>"I don't like the sea much, Ready; I wish we were safe on shore again," replied the lad.</s> <s>"Don't the waves look as if they wished to beat the ship all to pieces?"</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="masterman.c0.p10"><s>"Yes, they do; and they roar as if angry because they cannot bury the vessel beneath them: but I am used to them, and with a good ship like this, and a good captain and crew, I don't care for them."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="masterman.c0.p11"><s>"But sometimes ships do sink, and then everybody is drowned."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="masterman.c0.p12"><s>"Yes; and very often the very ships sink which those on board think are most safe.</s> <s>We can only do our best, and after that we must submit to the will of Heaven."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="masterman.c0.p13"><s>"What little birds are those flying about so close to the water?"</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="masterman.c0.p14"><s>"Those are Mother Carey's chickens.</s> <s>You seldom see them except in a storm, or when a storm is coming on."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="masterman.c0.p15"><s>The birds which William referred to were the stormy petrels.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="masterman.c0.p16"><s>"Were you ever shipwrecked on a desolate island like Robinson Crusoe?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="masterman.c0.p17"><s>"Yes, Master William, I have been shipwrecked; but I never heard of Robinson Crusoe.</s> <s>So many have been wrecked and undergone great hardships, and so many more have never lived to tell what they have suffered, that it's not very likely that I should have known that one man you speak of, out of so many."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="masterman.c0.p18"><s>"Oh! but it's all in a book which I have read.</s> <s>I could tell you all about it--and so I will when the ship is quiet again; but now I wish you would help me down below, for I promised mamma not to stay up long."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="masterman.c0.p19" type="speech"><s>"Then always keep your promise like a good lad," replied the old man; <qs/>"now give me your hand, and I'll answer for it that we will fetch the hatchway without a tumble; and when the weather is fine again, I'll tell you how I was wrecked, and you shall tell me all about Robinson Crusoe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="masterman.c0.p20"><s>Having seen William safe to the cabin door, the old seaman returned to the deck, for it was his watch.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="masterman.c0.p21"><s>Masterman Ready, for such was his name, had been more than fifty years at sea, having been bound apprentice to a collier which sailed from South Shields, when he was only ten years old.</s> <s>His face was browned from long exposure, and there were deep furrows on his cheeks, but he was still a hale and active man.</s> <s>He had served many years on board of a man-of-war, and had been in every climate: he had many strange stories to tell, and he might be believed even when his stories were strange, for he would not tell an untruth.</s> <s>He could navigate a vessel, and, of course, he could read and write.</s> <s>The name of Ready was very well suited to him, for he was seldom at a loss; and in cases of difficulty and danger, the captain would not hesitate to ask his opinion, and frequently take his advice.</s> <s>He was second mate of the vessel.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="masterman.c0.p22"><s>The _Pacific_ was, as we have observed, a very fine ship, and well able to contend with the most violent storm.</s> <s>She was of more than four hundred tons burthen, and was then making a passage out to New South Wales, with a valuable cargo of English hardware, cutlery, and other manufactures.</s> <s>The captain was a good navigator and seaman, and moreover a good man, of a cheerful, happy disposition, always making the best of everything, and when accidents did happen, always more inclined to laugh than to look grave.</s> <s>His name was Osborn.</s> <s>The first mate, whose name was Mackintosh, was a Scotsman, rough and ill-tempered, but paying strict attention to his duty--a man that Captain Osborn could trust, but whom he did not like.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="masterman.c0.p23"><s>Ready we have already spoken of, and it will not be necessary to say anything about the seamen on board, except that there were thirteen of them, hardly a sufficient number to man so large a vessel; but just as they were about to sail, five of the seamen, who did not like the treatment they had received from Mackintosh, the first mate, had left the ship, and Captain Osborn did not choose to wait until he could obtain others in their stead.</s> <s>This proved unfortunate, as the events which we shall hereafter relate will show.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="masterman.c0.p24"><s>CHAPTER TWO.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="masterman.c0.p25"><s>Master William, whom we have introduced to the reader, was the eldest boy of a family who were passengers on board, consisting of the father, mother, and four children: his father was a Mr Seagrave, a very well-informed, clever man, who having for many years held an office under government at Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, was now returning from a leave of absence of three years.</s> <s>He had purchased from the government several thousand acres of land; it had since risen very much in value, and the sheep and cattle which he had put on it were proving a source of great profit.</s> <s>His property had been well managed by the person who had charge of it during his absence in England, and he was now taking out with him a variety of articles of every description for its improvement, and for his own use, such as furniture for his house, implements of agriculture, seeds, plants, cattle, and many other things too numerous to mention.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="masterman.c0.p26"><s>Mrs Seagrave was an amiable woman, but not in very strong health.</s> <s>The family consisted of William, who was the eldest, a clever, steady boy, but, at the same time, full of mirth and humour; Thomas, who was six years old, a very thoughtless but good-tempered boy, full of mischief, and always in a scrape; Caroline, a little girl of seven years; and Albert, a fine strong little fellow, who was not one year old: he was under the charge of a black girl, who had come from the Cape of Good Hope to Sydney, and had followed Mrs Seagrave to England.</s> <s>We have now mentioned all the people on board of the Pacific: perhaps we ought not to forget two shepherd's dogs, belonging to Mr Seagrave, and a little terrier, which was a great favourite of Captain Osborn, to whom she belonged.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="masterman.c0.p27"><s>It was not until the fourth day from its commencement that the gale abated, and then it gradually subsided until it was nearly a calm.</s> <s>The men who had been watching night after night during the gale now brought all their clothes which had been drenched by the rain and spray, and hung them up in the rigging to dry: the sails, also, which had been furled, and had been saturated by the wet, were now loosened and spread out that they might not be mildewed.</s> <s>The wind blew mild and soft, the sea had gone down, and the ship was running through the water at the speed of about four miles an hour.</s> <s>Mrs Seagrave, wrapped up in a cloak, was seated upon one of the arm-chests near the stern of the ship, her husband and children were all with her enjoying the fine weather, when Captain Osborn, who had been taking an observation of the sun with his sextant, came up to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="masterman.c0.p28"><s>"Well, Master Tommy, you are very glad that the gale is over?"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="masterman.c0.p29" type="speech"><s>"I didn't care," replied Tommy, <qs/>"only I spilt all my soup.</s> <s>But Juno tumbled off her chair, and rolled away with the baby, till papa picked them both up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="masterman.c0.p30"><s>"It was a mercy that poor Albert was not killed," observed Mrs Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="masterman.c0.p31"><s>"And so he might have been, if Juno had not thought only of him and nothing at all about herself," replied Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="masterman.c0.p32"><s>"That's very true, sir," replied Captain Osborn.</s> <s>"She saved the child, and, I fear, hurt herself."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="masterman.c0.p33"><s>"I thump my head very hard," said Juno, smiling.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="masterman.c0.p34"><s>"Yes, and it's lucky that you have a good thick woolly coat over it," replied Captain Osborn, laughing.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="masterman.c0.p35"><s>"It is 12 o'clock by the sun, sir," said Mackintosh, the first mate, to the captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="masterman.c0.p36"><s>"Then bring me up the latitude, Mr Mackintosh, while I work out the longitude from the sights which I took this morning.</s> <s>In five minutes, Mr Seagrave, I shall be ready to prick off over our place on the chart."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="masterman.c0.p37" type="speech"><s>"Here are the dogs come up on deck," said William; <qs/>"I dare say they are as glad of the fine weather as we are.</s> <s>Come here, Romulus!</s> <s>Here, Remus!--Remus!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="masterman.c0.p38" type="speech"><s>"Well, sir," said Ready, who was standing by them with his quadrant in his hand, <qs/>"I should like to ask you a question.</s> <s>Those dogs of yours have two very odd names which I never heard before.</s> <s>Who were Romulus and Remus?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="masterman.c0.p39" type="speech"><s>"Romulus and Remus," replied Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"were the names of two shepherds, brothers, who in ancient days founded the city of Rome, which eventually became the largest and most celebrated empire in the world.</s> <s>They were the first kings of Rome, and reigned together.</s> <s>History says that Remus affronted Romulus by leaping over a wall he had raised, and Romulus, in his anger, took away his life; but the history of early days is not to be depended upon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="masterman.c0.p40" type="speech"><s>"No, nor the brothers either, it appears," replied Ready; <qs/>"however, it is the old story--two of a trade can never agree.</s> <s>One sometimes hears of Rome now--is that the same place?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="masterman.c0.p41" type="speech"><s>"Yes," replied William, <qs/>"it is the remains of the old city."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="masterman.c0.p42"><s>"Well, one lives and learns," said Ready.</s> <s>"I have learnt something to-day, which everyone will to the last day of his life, if he will only ask questions.</s> <s>I'm an old man, and perhaps don't know much, except in the seafaring way; but I should have known much less if I did not ask for information, and was not ashamed to acknowledge my ignorance; that's the way to learn, Master William."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="masterman.c0.p43" type="speech"><s>"Very good advice, Ready,--and, William, I hope you will profit by it," said Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"never be ashamed to ask the meaning of what you do not understand."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="masterman.c0.p44"><s>"I always do, papa.</s> <s>Do I not ask you questions, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="masterman.c0.p45"><s>"Yes, you do, and very clever questions for a boy of your age; and I only wish that I could answer them better than I can sometimes."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="masterman.c0.p46" type="speech"><s>"I should like to go down now, my dear," said Mrs Seagrave; <qs/>"perhaps Ready will see the baby down safe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="masterman.c0.p47"><s>"That I will, ma'am," said Ready, putting his quadrant on the capstan:</s> <s>"now, Juno, give me the child, and go down first;--backwards, you stupid girl! how often do I tell you that?</s> <s>Some day or another you will come down with a run."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="masterman.c0.p48"><s>"And break my head," said Juno.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="masterman.c0.p49"><s>"Yes, or break your arm; and then who is to hold the child?"</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="masterman.c0.p50"><s>As soon as they were all down in the cabin, the captain and Mr Seagrave marked the position of the vessel on the chart, and found that they were one hundred and thirty miles from the Cape of Good Hope.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="masterman.c0.p51"><s>"If the wind holds, we shall be in to-morrow," said Mr Seagrave to his wife.</s> <s>"Juno, perhaps you may see your father and mother."</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="masterman.c0.p52"><s>Poor Juno shook her head, and a tear or two stole down her dark cheek.</s> <s>With a mournful face she told them, that her father and mother belonged to a Dutch boer, who had gone with them many miles into the interior: she had been parted from them when quite a little child, and had been left at Cape Town.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="masterman.c0.p53"><s>CHAPTER THREE.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="masterman.c0.p54"><s>The next morning the _Pacific_ arrived at the Cape and anchored in Table Bay.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="masterman.c0.p55"><s>"Why do they call this Table Bay, Ready?" said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="masterman.c0.p56"><s>"I suppose it's because they call that great mountain the Table Mountain, Master William; you see how flat the mountain is on the top."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="masterman.c0.p57"><s>"Yes, it is quite as flat as a table."</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="masterman.c0.p58"><s>"Yes, and sometimes you will see the white clouds rolling down over the top of it in a very curious manner, and that the sailors call spreading the tablecloth: it is a sign of bad weather."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="masterman.c0.p59" type="speech"><s>"Then I hope they will not spread the tablecloth while we are here, Ready," said William, <qs/>"for I shall certainly have no appetite.</s> <s>We have had bad weather enough already, and mamma suffers so much from it.</s> <s>What a pretty place it is!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="masterman.c0.p60" type="speech"><s>"We shall remain here two days, sir," said Captain Osborn to Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"if you and Mrs Seagrave would like to go on shore."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="masterman.c0.p61"><s>"I will go down and ask Mrs Seagrave," said her husband, who went down the ladder, followed by William.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="masterman.c0.p62"><s>Upon the question being put to Mrs Seagrave, she replied that she was quite satisfied with the ship having no motion, and did not feel herself equal to going on shore; it was therefore decided that she should remain on board with the two younger children, and that, on the following day, Mr Seagrave should take William and Tommy to see Cape Town, and return on board before night.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="masterman.c0.p63"><s>The next morning, Captain Osborn lowered down one of the large boats, and Mr Seagrave, accompanied by Captain Osborn, went on shore with William and Tommy.</s> <s>Tommy had promised his mamma to be very good; but that he always did, and almost always forgot his promise directly he was out of sight.</s> <s>As soon as they landed, they went up to a gentleman's house, with whom Captain Osborn was acquainted.</s> <s>They stayed for a few minutes to drink a glass of lemonade, for it was very warm; and then it was proposed that they should go to the Company's Gardens and see the wild beasts which were confined there, at which William was much delighted, and Tommy clapped his hands with joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="masterman.c0.p64"><s>"What are the Company's Gardens, papa?" inquired William.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="masterman.c0.p65"><s>"They were made by the Dutch East India Company, at the time that the Cape of Good Hope was in their possession.</s> <s>They are, properly speaking, Botanical Gardens; but, at the same time, the wild animals are kept there.</s> <s>Formerly there were a great many, but they have not been paid attention to lately, for we have plenty of these animals in England now."</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="masterman.c0.p66"><s>"What shall we see?" said Tommy.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="masterman.c0.p67"><s>"You will see lions, Tommy, a great many in a large den together," said Captain Osborn.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="masterman.c0.p68"><s>"Oh!</s> <s>I want to see a lion."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="masterman.c0.p69"><s>"You must not go too near them, recollect."</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="masterman.c0.p70"><s>"No, I won't," said Tommy.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="masterman.c0.p71"><s>As soon as they entered the gates, Tommy escaped from Captain Osborn, and ran away in his hurry to see the lions; but Captain Osborn caught him again, and held him fast by the hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="masterman.c0.p72" type="speech"><s>"Here is a pair of very strange birds," said the gentleman who accompanied them; <qs/>"they are called Secretaries, on account of the feathers which hang behind their heads, as the feather of a pen does when a clerk puts it behind his ear: but they are very useful, for they are snake-killers; indeed, they would, if they could, live altogether upon snakes, which they are very great enemies to, never letting one escape.</s> <s>They strike them with their feet, and with such force as to kill them immediately."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="masterman.c0.p73"><s>"Are there many snakes in this country?" inquired William.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="masterman.c0.p74" type="speech"><s>"Yes, and very venomous snakes," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"so that these birds are very useful in destroying them.</s> <s>You observe, William, that the Almighty, in his wisdom, has so arranged it that no animal (especially of a noxious kind) shall be multiplied to excess, but kept under by being preyed upon by some other; indeed, wherever in any country an animal exists in any quantity, there is generally found another animal which destroys it.</s> <s>The Secretary inhabits this country where snakes exist in numbers, that it may destroy them: in England the bird would be of little value."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="masterman.c0.p75"><s>"But some animals are too large or too fierce to be destroyed by others, papa; for instance, the elephant and the lion."</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="masterman.c0.p76"><s>"Very true; but these larger animals do not breed so fast, and therefore their numbers do not increase so rapidly.</s> <s>For instance, a pair of elephants will not have more than one young one in the space of two years or more; while the rabbits, which are preyed upon and the food of so many other beasts as well as birds, would increase enormously, if they were not destroyed.</s> <s>Examine through the whole of creation, and you will find that there is an unerring hand, which invariably preserves the balance exact; and that there are no more mouths than for which food is provided, although accidental circumstances may for a time occasion a slight alteration."</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="masterman.c0.p77"><s>They continued their walk until they came to the den of the lions.</s> <s>It was a large place, in closed with a strong and high wall of stone, with only one window to it for the visitors to look at them, as it was open above.</s> <s>This window was wide, and with strong iron bars running from the top to the bottom; but the width between the bars was such that a lion could put his paw out with ease; and they were therefore cautioned not to go too near.</s> <s>It was a fine sight to see eight or ten of these noble-looking animals lying down in various attitudes, quite indifferent apparently to the people outside--basking in the sun, and slowly moving their tufted tails to and fro.</s> <s>William examined them at a respectful distance from the bars; and so did Tommy, who had his mouth open with astonishment, in which there was at first not a little fear mixed, but he soon got bolder.</s> <s>The gentleman who had accompanied them, and who had been long at the Cape, was relating to Mr Seagrave and Captain Osborn some very curious anecdotes about the lion.</s> <s>William and they were so interested, that they did not perceive that Tommy had slipped back to the grated window of the den.</s> <s>Tommy looked at the lions, and then he wanted to make them move about: there was one fine full-grown young lion, about three years old, who was lying down nearest to the window; and Tommy took up a stone and threw it at him: the lion appeared not to notice it, for he did not move, although he fixed his eyes upon Tommy; so Tommy became more brave, and threw another, and then another, approaching each time nearer to the bars of the window.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="masterman.c0.p78"><s>All of a sudden the lion gave a tremendous roar, and sprang at Tommy, bounding against the iron bars of the cage with such force that, had they not been very strong, it must have broken them.</s> <s>As it was, they shook and rattled so that pieces of mortar fell from the stones.</s> <s>Tommy shrieked; and, fortunately for himself, fell back and tumbled head over heels, or the lion's paws would have reached him.</s> <s>Captain Osborn and Mr Seagrave ran up to Tommy, and picked him up: he roared with fright as soon as he could fetch his breath, while the lion stood at the bars, lashing his tail, snarling, and showing his enormous fangs.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="masterman.c0.p79"><s>"Take me away--take me on board the ship!" cried Tommy, who was terribly frightened.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="masterman.c0.p80"><s>"What did you do, Tommy?" said Captain Osborn.</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="masterman.c0.p81"><s>"I won't throw any more stones, Mr Lion; I won't indeed!" cried Tommy, looking terrified towards the animal.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="masterman.c0.p82"><s>Mr Seagrave scolded Tommy well for his foolish conduct, and by degrees he became more composed; but he did not recover himself until they had walked some distance away from the lion's den.</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="masterman.c0.p83"><s>They then looked at the other animals which were to be seen, Tommy keeping a most respectful distance from every one of them.</s> <s>He wouldn't even go near to a Cape sheep with a broad tail.</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="masterman.c0.p84"><s>When they had seen everything, they went back to the gentleman's house to dinner; and, after dinner, they returned on board.</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="masterman.c0.p85"><s>CHAPTER FOUR.</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="masterman.c0.p86"><s>The following morning the fresh water and provisions were received on board, and once more the _Pacific_ stretched her broad canvas to the winds, and there was every prospect of a rapid voyage, as for many days she continued her passage with a fair wind and flowing sheet.</s> <s>But this did not continue: it fell calm, and remained so for nearly three days, during which not a breath of wind was to be seen on the wide expanse of water; all nature appeared as if in repose, except that now and then an albatross would drop down at some distance from the stern of the vessel, and, as he swam lazily along with his wings half-furled, pick up the fragments of food which had been thrown over the side.</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="masterman.c0.p87"><s>"What great bird is that, Ready?" inquired William.</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="masterman.c0.p88"><s>"It is an albatross, the largest sea-bird we have.</s> <s>Their wings are very long.</s> <s>I have seen them shot, and they have measured eleven feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other when the wings have been spread out."</s> </p>

<p pid="89" id="masterman.c0.p89"><s>"It is the first one that I have seen," said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="masterman.c0.p90"><s>"Because you seldom meet them north of the Cape, sir: people do say that they go to sleep on the wing, balancing themselves high up in the air."</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="masterman.c0.p91" type="speech"><s>"Papa," said William, turning to Mr Seagrave, who stood by, <qs/>"why is it that one bird can swim and another cannot?</s> <s>You recollect when Tommy drove the hens into the large pond, they flounced about, and their feathers became wet, and would support them no longer, and then they were drowned.</s> <s>Now, how does a sea-bird contrive to remain so long on the water?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="masterman.c0.p92"><s>"Because a sea-bird, William, is provided with a sort of oil on purpose to anoint the outside of its feathers, and this oil prevents the water from penetrating them.</s> <s>Have you not observed the ducks on shore dressing their feathers with their bills?</s> <s>They were then using this oil to make their feathers waterproof."</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="masterman.c0.p93"><s>"How odd!"</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="masterman.c0.p94"><s>"Don't say how odd, William; that is not an expression to use when we talk of the wonderful provisions made by the Almighty hand, who neglects not the meanest of his creatures--say rather, how wonderful!"</s> </p>

<p pid="95" id="masterman.c0.p95" type="speech"><s>"That's very true, sir," observed Ready; <qs/>"but still you must not be too hard upon Master William, for I have heard many a grownup man make use of the same expression."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="106" id="masterman.c0.p106"><s>"Well, and I'm inclined to agree with you, Ready; so we must send topgallant yards down on deck, and all the small sails and lumber out of the tops.</s> <s>Get the trysail aft and bent, and lower down the gaff.</s> <s>I will go forward."</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="masterman.c0.p107"><s>Their preparations were hardly complete before the wind had settled to a fierce gale from the north-east.</s> <s>The sea rose rapidly; topsail after topsail was furled; and by dusk the _Pacific_ was flying through the water with the wind on her quarter, under reefed foresail and storm staysail.</s> <s>It was with difficulty that three men at the wheel could keep the helm, such were the blows which the vessel received from the heavy seas on the quarter.</s> <s>Not one seaman in the ship took advantage of his watch below to go to sleep that night, careless as they generally are; the storm was too dreadful.</s> <s>About three o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly subsided; it was but for a minute or two, and then it again burst on the vessel from another quarter of the compass, as Ready had foretold, splitting the foresail into fragments, which lashed and flogged the wind till they were torn away by it, and carried far to leeward.</s> <s>The heavens above were of a pitchy darkness, and the only light was from the creaming foam of the sea on every side.</s> <s>The shift of wind, which had been to the west-north-west, compelled them to alter the course of the vessel, for they had no chance but to scud, as they now did, under bare poles; but in consequence of the sea having taken its run from the former wind, which had been north-east, it was, as sailors call it, cross, and every minute the waves poured over the ship, sweeping all before their weight of waters.</s> <s>One poor man was washed overboard, and any attempt made to save him would have been unavailing.</s> <s>Captain Osborn was standing by the weather gunnel, holding on by one of the belaying-pins, when he said to Mackintosh:</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="masterman.c0.p111"><s>"Far more fear from above than from below just now," replied Ready, pointing to the yard-arms of the ship, to each of which were little balls of electric matter attached, flaring out to a point.</s> <s>"Look at those two clouds, sir, rushing at each other; if I--"</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="masterman.c0.p112"><s>Ready had not time to finish what he would have said, before a blaze of light, so dazzling that it left them all in utter darkness for some seconds afterwards, burst upon their vision, accompanied with a peal of thunder, at which the whole vessel trembled fore and aft.</s> <s>A crash--a rushing forward--and a shriek were heard, and when they had recovered their eyesight, the foremast had been rent by the lightning as if it had been a lath, and the ship was in flames: the men at the wheel, blinded by the lightning, as well as appalled, could not steer; the ship broached to--away went the mainmast over the side--and all was wreck, confusion, and dismay.</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="masterman.c0.p113"><s>Fortunately the heavy seas which poured over the forecastle soon extinguished the flames, or they all must have perished; but the ship lay now helpless, and at the mercy of the waves beating violently against the wrecks of the masts which floated to leeward, but were still held fast to the vessel by their rigging.</s> <s>As soon as they could recover from the shock, Ready and the first mate hastened to the wheel to try to get the ship before the wind; but this they could not do, as, the foremast and mainmast being gone, the mizenmast prevented her paying off and answering to the helm.</s> <s>Ready, having persuaded two of the men to take the helm, made a sign to Mackintosh (for now the wind was so loud that they could not hear each other speak), and, going aft, they obtained axes, and cut away the mizen-rigging; the mizen-topmast and head of the mizenmast went over the side, and then the stump of the foremast was sufficient to get the ship before the wind again.</s> <s>Still there was much delay and confusion, before they could clear away the wreck of the masts; and, as soon as they could make inquiry, they found that four of the men had been killed by the lightning and the fall of the foremast, and there were now but eight remaining, besides Captain Osborn and his two mates.</s> </p>

<p pid="115" id="masterman.c0.p115"><s>Sailors are never discouraged by danger as long as they have any chance of relieving themselves by their own exertions.</s> <s>The loss of their shipmates, so instantaneously summoned away,--the wrecked state of the vessel,--the wild surges burying them beneath their angry waters,--the howling of the wind, the dazzling of the lightning, and the pealing of the thunder, did not prevent them from doing what their necessity demanded.</s> <s>Mackintosh, the first mate, rallied the men, and contrived to fix a block and strap to the still smoking stump of the foremast; a rope was rove through the block, and the main-topgallant sail hoisted, so that the vessel might run faster before the gale, and answer her helm better than she did.</s> </p>

<p pid="116" id="masterman.c0.p116"><s>The ship was again before the wind, and comparatively safe, notwithstanding the heavy blows she now received from the pursuing waves.</s> <s>Night again came on, but there was no repose, and the men were worn out with exposure and fatigue.</s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="masterman.c0.p117"><s>The third day of the gale dawned, but the appearances were as alarming as ever: the continual breaking of the seas over the stern had washed away the binnacles, and it was impossible now to be certain of the course the ship had been steered, or the distance which had been run; the leaky state of the vessel proved how much she had already suffered from the violent shocks which she had received, and the certainty was apparent, that if the weather did not abate, she could not possibly withstand the force of the waves much longer.</s> </p>

<p pid="118" id="masterman.c0.p118"><s>The countenance of Captain Osborn showed great anxiety: he had a heavy responsibility on his shoulders--he might lose a valuable ship, and still more valuable cargo, even if they did not all lose their lives; for they were now approaching where the sea was studded with low coral islands, upon which they might be thrown by the waves and wind, without having the slightest power to prevent it in their present disabled condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="masterman.c0.p124" type="speech"><s>"You are right," replied Captain Osborn; <qs/>"but hold hard, Ready, that sea's aboard of us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="masterman.c0.p125"><s>Ready had just time to cling with both hands to the belaying-pins when the sea poured over the vessel, with a volume of water which for some time swept them off their legs: they clung on firmly, and at last recovered their feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="126" id="masterman.c0.p126"><s>"She started a timber or two with that blow, I rather think," said Ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="masterman.c0.p127" type="speech"><s>"I'm afraid so; the best vessel ever built could not stand such shocks long," replied Captain Osborn; <qs/>"and at present, with our weak crew, I do not see that we can get more sail upon her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="128" id="masterman.c0.p128"><s>All that night the ship flew in darkness before the gale.</s> <s>At daybreak the wind abated, and the sea went down: the ship was, however, still kept before the wind, for she had suffered too much to venture to put her broadside to the sea.</s> <s>Preparations were now made for getting up jury-masts; and the worn-out seamen were busily employed, under the direction of Captain Osborn and his two mates, when Mr Seagrave and William came upon deck.</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="masterman.c0.p134" type="speech"><s>"I fear she is very weak and ill," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"nothing but fine weather will do her any good.</s> <s>Do you think that it will be fine now?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="423" id="masterman.c0.p423"><s>"No, I do not, William; but, in our present situation, I think of more things than perhaps your father and mother would: they have never known what it is to be put to their shifts; but a man like me, who has been all his life at sea, and who has been wrecked, and suffered hardships and difficulties, and has been obliged to think or die, has a greater knowledge, not only from his own sufferings, but by hearing how others have acted when they were in distress.</s> <s>Necessity sharpens a man's wits; and it is very curious what people do contrive when they are compelled to do so, especially seamen."</s> </p>

<p pid="436" id="masterman.c0.p436" type="speech"><s>"I hope we shall not meet with any one more dangerous," replied William, laughing; <qs/>"but I must say that I was alarmed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="466" id="masterman.c0.p466"><s>A more lovely scene could scarcely be imagined.</s> <s>The cocoa-nut grove terminated about a quarter of a mile from the beach, very abruptly, for there was a rapid descent for about thirty feet from where they stood to the land below, on which was a mixture of little grass knolls and brushwood, to about fifty yards from the water's edge, where it was met with dazzling white sand, occasionally divided by narrow ridges of rock which ran inland.</s> <s>The water was a deep blue, except where it was broken into white foam on the reefs, which extended for miles from the beach, and the rocks of which now and then showed themselves above water.</s> <s>On the rocks were perched crowds of gannets and men-of-war birds, while others wheeled in the air, every now and then darting down into the blue sea, and bringing up in their bills a fish out of the shoals which rippled the water, or bounded clear of it in their gambols.</s> <s>The form of the coast was that of a horse-shoe bay--two points of land covered with shrubs extending far out on each side.</s> <s>The line of the horizon, far out at sea, was clear and unbroken.</s> </p>

<p pid="467" id="masterman.c0.p467"><s>Ready remained for some time without speaking; he scanned the horizon right and left, and then he turned his eyes along the land.</s> <s>At last William said:</s> </p>

<p pid="469" id="masterman.c0.p469"><s>"Why, I am thinking that we must look for water as fast as we can."</s> </p>

<p pid="470" id="masterman.c0.p470"><s>"But why are you so anxious?"</s> </p>

<p pid="471" id="masterman.c0.p471"><s>"Because I can see no island to leeward of us as I expected, and therefore there is less chance of getting off this island; and this bay, although very beautiful, is full of reefs, and I see no inlet, which makes it awkward for many reasons.</s> <s>But we cannot judge at first sight.</s> <s>Let us now sit down and take our dinner, and after that we will explore a little."</s> </p>

<p pid="472" id="masterman.c0.p472" type="speech"><s>Ready cut two wide marks in the stems of the cocoa-nut trees, and then descended with William to the low ground, where they sat down to eat their dinner.</s> <s>As soon as their meal was finished they first walked down to the water's edge, and Ready turned his eyes inland to see if he could discover any little ravine or hollow which might be likely to contain fresh water.</s> <s>"There are one or two places there," observed Ready, pointing to them with his finger, <qs/>"where the water has run down in the rainy season: we must examine them carefully, but not now.</s> <s>I want to find out whether there is any means of getting our little boat through this reef of rocks, or otherwise we shall have very hard work (if we change our abode to this spot) to bring all our stores through that wood; so we will pass the rest of this day in examining the coast, and to-morrow we will try for fresh water."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="473" id="masterman.c0.p473"><s>"Look at the dogs, Ready, they are drinking the sea-water, poor things!"</s> </p>

<p pid="474" id="masterman.c0.p474"><s>"They won't drink much of that, I expect; you see they don't like it already."</s> </p>

<p pid="475" id="masterman.c0.p475"><s>"How beautiful the corals are--look here, they grow like little trees under the water,--and look here, here is really a flower in bloom growing on that rock just below the water."</s> </p>

<p pid="477" id="masterman.c0.p477"><s>William did so, and the flower, as he called it, immediately shut up.</s> </p>

<p pid="479" id="masterman.c0.p479"><s>"Yes, it is; I have often seen them before: they call them sea-anemones--they are animals; but I don't know whether they are shell-fish or not.</s> <s>Now, let us walk out to the end of this point of land, and see if we can discover any opening in the reef.</s> <s>The sun is going down, and we shall not have more than an hour's daylight, and then we must look out for a place to sleep in."</s> </p>

<p pid="480" id="masterman.c0.p480" type="speech"><s>"But what is that?" cried William, pointing to the sand--<qs/>"that round dark thing?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="482" id="masterman.c0.p482"><s>"Can't we catch them?"</s> </p>

<p pid="483" id="masterman.c0.p483"><s>"Yes, we can catch them if we go about it quietly; but you must take care not to go behind them, or they will throw such a shower of sand upon you, with their hind flappers or fins, that they would blind you and escape at the same time.</s> <s>The way to catch them is to get at their heads and turn them over on their backs by one of the fore-fins, and then they cannot turn back again."</s> </p>

<p pid="484" id="masterman.c0.p484"><s>"Let us go and catch that one."</s> </p>

<p pid="485" id="masterman.c0.p485"><s>"I should think it very foolish to do so, as we could not take it away, and it would die to-morrow from the heat of the sun."</s> </p>

<p pid="486" id="masterman.c0.p486"><s>"I did not think of that, Ready; if we come to live here, I suppose we shall catch them whenever we want them."</s> </p>

<p pid="487" id="masterman.c0.p487"><s>"No, we shall not, for they only come on shore in the breeding-season; but we will make a turtle pond somewhere which they cannot get out of, but which the sea flows into; and then when we catch them we will put them into it, and have them ready for use as we require them."</s> </p>

<p pid="488" id="masterman.c0.p488"><s>"That will be a very good plan," replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="489" id="masterman.c0.p489"><s>They now continued their walk, and, forcing their way through the brushwood which grew thick upon the point of land, soon arrived at the end of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="491" id="masterman.c0.p491" type="speech"><s>"That is another island, which I am very glad to see even in that direction, although it will not be so easy to gain it, if we are obliged to leave this for want of water.</s> <s>It is a much larger island than this, at all events,<qs/>" continued Ready, scanning the length of the horizon, along which he could see the tops of the trees.--<alt-qs/>"<qe/>Well, we have done very well for our first day, so we will go and look for a place to lie down and pass the night."<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="492" id="masterman.c0.p492"><s>They returned to the high ground where the cocoa-nut grove ended, and collecting together several branches and piles of leaves, made a good soft bed under the trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="493" id="masterman.c0.p493"><s>"And now we'll go to bed.</s> <s>Look, William, at the long shadow of the trees the sun has nearly set."</s> </p>

<p pid="494" id="masterman.c0.p494"><s>"Shall I give the dogs some water now, Ready?</s> <s>See, poor Remus is licking the sides of the bottles."</s> </p>

<p pid="495" id="masterman.c0.p495"><s>"No, do not give them any: it appears to be cruel, but I want the intelligence of the poor animals to-morrow, and the want of water will make them very keen, and we shall turn it to good account.</s> <s>So now, William, we must not forget to return thanks to a merciful God, and to beg his care over us for this night.</s> <s>We little know what the day may bring forth.</s> <s>Good-night!"</s> </p>

<p pid="497" id="masterman.c0.p497" type="speech"><s>William slept as sound as if he had been on shore in England upon a soft bed in a warm room--so did old Ready; and when they awoke the next morning it was broad daylight.</s> <s>The poor dogs were suffering for want of water, and it pained William to see them with their tongues out, panting and whining as they looked up to him.</s> <s>"Now, William," said Ready, <qs/>"shall we take our breakfast before we start, or have a walk first?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="498" id="masterman.c0.p498"><s>"Ready, I cannot really drink a drop of water myself, and I am thirsty, unless you give a little to these poor dogs."</s> </p>

<p pid="499" id="masterman.c0.p499"><s>"I pity the poor dumb creatures as much as you do, Master Willy; it is kindness to ourselves and them too, which makes me refuse it to them.</s> <s>However, if you like, we will take a walk first, and see if we can find any water.</s> <s>Let us first go to the little dell to the right, and if we do not succeed, we will try farther on where the water has run down during the rainy season."</s> <s>William was very glad to go, and away they went, followed by the dogs, Ready having taken up the spade, which he carried on his shoulder.</s> <s>They soon came to the dell, and the dogs put their noses to the ground, and snuffed about.</s> <s>Ready watched them; at last they lay down panting.</s> </p>

<p pid="500" id="masterman.c0.p500"><s>"Let us go on," said Ready, thoughtfully; they went on to where the run of water appeared to have been--the dogs snuffed about more eagerly than before.</s> </p>

<p pid="501" id="masterman.c0.p501"><s>"You see, William, these poor dogs are now so eager for water, that if there is any, they will find it out where we never could.</s> <s>I don't expect water above-ground, but there may be some below it.</s> <s>This beach is hardly far enough from the water's edge, or I should try in the sand for it."</s> </p>

<p pid="502" id="masterman.c0.p502"><s>"In the sand--but would it not be salt?" replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="503" id="masterman.c0.p503"><s>"No, not if at a good distance from the sea-beach; for you see, William, the sand by degrees filters the sea-water fresh, and very often when the sand runs in a long way from the high-water mark, if you dig down, you will find good fresh water, at other times it is a little brackish, but still fit for use."</s> </p>

<p pid="504" id="masterman.c0.p504"><s>"Look, Ready, at Romulus and Remus--how hard they are digging with their paws there in the hollow."</s> </p>

<p pid="505" id="masterman.c0.p505"><s>"Thanks to Heaven that they are!</s> <s>You don't know how happy you have made me feel: for, to tell you the truth, I was beginning to be alarmed."</s> </p>

<p pid="506" id="masterman.c0.p506"><s>"But why do they dig?"</s> </p>

<p pid="507" id="masterman.c0.p507"><s>"Because there is water there, poor animals.</s> <s>Now you see the advantage of having kept them in pain for a few hours; it is in all probability the saving of all of us, for we must either have found water or quitted this island.</s> <s>Now let us help the poor dogs with the spade, and they shall soon be rewarded for their sufferings."</s> </p>

<p pid="508" id="masterman.c0.p508"><s>Ready walked quickly to where the dogs continued digging: they had already got down to the moist earth, and were so eagerly at work, that it was with difficulty he could get them out of his way to use his spade.</s> <s>He had not dug two feet before the water trickled down, and in four or five minutes the dogs had sufficient to plunge their noses in, and to drink copiously.</s> </p>

<p pid="509" id="masterman.c0.p509"><s>"Look at them! how they enjoy it!</s> <s>I don't think any Israelite felt more grateful when Moses struck the rock than I do now, William.</s> <s>This was the one thing wanting, but it was the one thing indispensable.</s> <s>Now we have everything we can wish for on this island, and if we are only content, we may be happy--ay, much happier than are those who are worrying themselves to heap up riches, not knowing who shall gather them.</s> <s>See, the poor animals have had enough at last.</s> <s>Now, shall we go back to breakfast?"</s> </p>

<p pid="510" id="masterman.c0.p510"><s>"Yes," replied William:</s> <s>"I shall enjoy it now, and have a good drink of water myself."</s> </p>

<p pid="511" id="masterman.c0.p511" type="speech"><s>"That is a plenteous spring, depend upon it," said Ready, as they walked back to where they had slept and left their knapsacks; <qs/>"but we must clear it out further up among the trees, where the sun cannot reach it, and then it will be cool, and not be dried up.</s> <s>We shall have plenty of work for the next year at least, if we remain here.</s> <s>Where we are now will be a capital spot to build our house on."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="513" id="masterman.c0.p513" type="speech"><s>They soon arrived at the end of the point of land, and found that Ready was not wrong in his supposition; the water was deep, and there was a passage many yards wide.</s> <s>The sea was so smooth, and the water so clear, that they could see down to the rocky bottom, and watched the fish as they darted along.</s> <s>"Look there!" said Willy, pointing out about fifty yards from the beach, <qs/>"a great shark, Ready!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="514" id="masterman.c0.p514"><s>"Yes, I see him, sir," replied Ready:</s> <s>"there's plenty of them here, depend upon it; and you must be very careful how you get into the water: the sharks always keep to the leeward of the island, and for one where Juno bathed your little brother, you will find fifty here.</s> <s>I'm quite satisfied now, William, we shall do very well, and all we have now to think of is moving away from the other side of the island as fast as possible."</s> </p>

<p pid="517" id="masterman.c0.p517"><s>As they walked along the edge of the sandy beach they found the sea-birds hovering close to them: all of a sudden a large shoal of fish threw themselves high and dry on the sand, and they were followed by several of a larger size, which also lay flapping on the beach, while the sea-birds, darting down close to the feet of William and Ready, and seizing up the fish, flew away with them.</s> </p>

<p pid="519" id="masterman.c0.p519"><s>"Yes, sir; but you see how it is--the small fish were chased by the larger ones, which are bonettas, and in their fright ran upon the beach.</s> <s>These bonettas were so anxious to catch them, that they came on shore also, and then the gannets picked them all up."</s> </p>

<p pid="520" id="masterman.c0.p520"><s>They found the hole which Ready had dug quite full of water, and, tasting it, it proved very sweet and good.</s> <s>Overjoyed at this discovery, they covered up the articles they agreed to leave behind them with some boughs under the notched cocoa-nut trees, and, calling the dogs, set off on their journey back again to the cove.</s> </p>

<p pid="543" id="masterman.c0.p543"><s>They went down to the beach.</s> <s>Ready first procured from the stores a good stout rope; and as the waves threw up casks and timbers of the vessel, they stopped them from being washed back again, and either rolled or hauled them up with the rope until they were safely landed.</s> <s>This occupied them for the major part of the day; and yet they had not collected a quarter of the articles that were in their reach, independent of the quantity which floated about out at sea and at the entrance of the cove.</s> </p>

<p pid="544" id="masterman.c0.p544" type="speech"><s>"I think," said Ready, <qs/>"we have done a good day's work; tomorrow we shall be able to do much more, for the sea is going down, and the sun is showing himself from the corner of that cloud.</s> <s>Now we will go to supper, and then see if we can make ourselves more comfortable for the night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="545" id="masterman.c0.p545"><s>The tent which had not been blown down was given to Mrs Seagrave and the children, and the other was fitted up as well as it could be.</s> <s>The bedding being all wet, they procured some sails from the stores, which, being stowed away farther in the grove, had not suffered much from the tempest; and, spreading the canvas, they lay down, and the night passed without any disaster, for the wind was now lulled to a pleasant breeze.</s> </p>

<p pid="546" id="masterman.c0.p546"><s>The next morning the sun shone bright--the air was fresh and bracing; but a slight breeze rippled the waters, and there was little or no surf.</s> <s>The various fragments of the wreck were tossed by the little surf that still remained; many things were lying on the beach which had landed during the night, and many more required but a little trouble to secure them.</s> <s>There appeared to be a sort of in draught into the cove, as all the articles which had been floating out at sea were now gradually coming on shore in that direction.</s> <s>Ready and Mr Seagrave worked till breakfast-time, and had by that time saved a great many casks and packages.</s> </p>

<p pid="550" id="masterman.c0.p550" type="speech"><s>"Yes, there's no want of them, William; so be very careful how you get into the water, and never let Tommy go near it, for they don't care how shallow it is when they see their food.</s> <s>But now, sir," said Ready, <qs/>"I must leave you and William to do what you can in saving any more of the wreck, while I set to and put the boat in proper repair."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="552" id="masterman.c0.p552"><s>As it would take some days for Ready to put the boat into proper order, Mr Seagrave determined that he would go to the other side of the island with William, that he might examine it himself; and, as Mrs Seagrave had no objection to be left with Ready and Juno, on the third day after the gale they set off.</s> <s>William led the way, guiding his footsteps through the grove by the blazing of the cocoa-nut trees; and in two hours they reached their destination.</s> </p>

<p pid="554" id="masterman.c0.p554"><s>"Yes, indeed it is, my dear boy," replied Mr Seagrave.</s> <s>"I fancied that nothing could be more beautiful than the spot where we reside, but this surpasses it, not only in variety, but in extent."</s> </p>

<p pid="555" id="masterman.c0.p555"><s>"And now let us examine the spring, father," said William, leading the way to the ravine.</s> </p>

<p pid="556" id="masterman.c0.p556"><s>The spring was full and flowing, and the water excellent.</s> <s>They then directed their steps towards the sandy beach, and, having walked some time, sat down upon a coral rock.</s> </p>

<p pid="557" id="masterman.c0.p557" type="speech"><s>"Who would have ever imagined, William," said Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"that this island, and so many more which abound in the Pacific Ocean, could have been raised by the work of little insects not bigger than a pin's head?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="558" id="masterman.c0.p558"><s>"Insects, father?" replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="559" id="masterman.c0.p559"><s>"Yes, insects.</s> <s>Give me that piece of dead coral, William.</s> <s>Do you see that on every branch there are a hundred little holes?</s> <s>Well, in every one of these little holes once lived a sea-insect; and as these insects increase, so do the branches of the coral-trees."</s> </p>

<p pid="560" id="masterman.c0.p560"><s>"Yes, I understand that; but how do you make out that this island was made by them?"</s> </p>

<p pid="561" id="masterman.c0.p561"><s>"Almost all the islands in these seas have been made by the labour and increase of these small animals.</s> <s>The coral grows at first at the bottom of the sea, where it is not disturbed by the winds or waves: by degrees, as it increases, it advances higher and higher to the surface, till at last it comes near to the top of the water; then it is stopped in its growth by the force of the winds and waves, which break it off, and of course it never grows above the water, for if it did the animals would die."</s> </p>

<p pid="562" id="masterman.c0.p562"><s>"Then how does it become an island?"</s> </p>

<p pid="563" id="masterman.c0.p563"><s>"By very slow degrees; the time, perhaps, much depending upon chance: for instance, a log of wood floating about, and covered with barnacles, may ground upon the coral reefs; that would be a sufficient commencement, for it would remain above water, and then shelter the coral to leeward of it, until a flat rock had formed, level with the edge of the water.</s> <s>The sea-birds are always looking for a place to rest upon, and they would soon find it, and then their droppings would, in course of time, form a little patch above water, and other floating substances would be thrown on it; and land-birds, who are blown out to sea, might rest themselves on it, and the seeds from their stomachs, when dropped, would grow into trees or bushes."</s> </p>

<p pid="564" id="masterman.c0.p564"><s>"I understand that."</s> </p>

<p pid="565" id="masterman.c0.p565"><s>"Well then, William, you observe there is an island commenced, as it were, and, once commenced, it soon increases, for the coral would then be protected to leeward, and grow up fast.</s> <s>Do you observe how the coral reefs extend at this side of the island, where they are protected from the winds and waves; and how different it is on the weather side, which we have just left?</s> <s>Just so the little patch above water protects the corals to leeward, and there the island increases fast; for the birds not only settle on it, but they make their nests and rear their young, and so every year the soil increases; and then, perhaps, one cocoa-nut in its great outside shell at last is thrown on these little patches--it takes root, and becomes a tree, every year shedding its large branches, which are turned into mould as soon as they decay, and then dropping its nuts, which again take root and grow in this mould; and thus they continue, season after season, and year after year, until the island becomes as large and as thickly covered with trees as the one we are now standing upon.</s> <s>Is not this wonderful, my dear boy?</s> <s>Is not he a great and good God who can make such minute animals as these work his pleasure, and at the time he thinks fit produce such a beautiful island as this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="566" id="masterman.c0.p566"><s>"Indeed he is!" exclaimed William.</s> </p>

<p pid="567" id="masterman.c0.p567"><s>"We only need use our eyes, William, and we shall love as well as adore.</s> <s>Look at that shell--is it not beautifully marked?--could the best painter in the world equal its colouring?"</s> </p>

<p pid="568" id="masterman.c0.p568"><s>"No, indeed,--I should think not."</s> </p>

<p pid="569" id="masterman.c0.p569"><s>"And yet there are thousands of them in sight, and perhaps millions more in the water.</s> <s>They have not been coloured in this way to be admired, like the works of man; for this island has been till now probably without any one upon it, and no one has ever seen them.</s> <s>It makes no difference to Him, who has but to wish, and all is complete."</s> </p>

<p pid="570" id="masterman.c0.p570"><s>For a few minutes after this conversation, Mr Seagrave and William were both silent.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave then rose from where he was sitting:</s> <s>"Come, William, let us now find our way back again; we have three hours' daylight left, and shall be home in good time."</s> </p>

<p pid="572" id="masterman.c0.p572"><s>Everything was now preparing for their removal to the leeward side of the island.</s> <s>Ready had nearly completed the boat; he had given it a thorough repair, and fitted a mast and sail.</s> <s>William and Mr Seagrave continued to collect and secure the various articles thrown on shore, particularly such as would be injured by their exposure to the weather: these they rolled or carried into the cocoa-nut grove, so as to be sheltered from the sun; but there were so many things thrown on shore day after day, that they hardly knew what they had: but they secured case and cask one after another, waiting for a better opportunity to examine their contents.</s> <s>At last they collected a great many articles together, and, with their shovels, covered them over with sand, it being impossible to get them from the beach without more time than they could spare.</s> </p>

<p pid="573" id="masterman.c0.p573"><s>Neither was Mrs Seagrave, who was now getting quite strong, or Juno, idle.</s> <s>They had made up everything that they could in packages, ready for moving.</s> <s>On the eighth day after the gale, they were ready, and it was arranged that Ready should put into the boat the bedding and canvas of one tent, and should take William with him on his expedition.</s> <s>Having transported this safe, he should return for a load of the most necessary articles, and then the family should walk through the grove to the other side of the island, and remain there with Mr Seagrave while Ready and William returned for the other tent; and after that, the boat should make as many trips as the weather would permit, till they had brought all the things absolutely required.</s> <s>It was a lovely calm morning when Ready and William pushed off in the boat, which was well loaded; and as soon as they were clear of the cove they hoisted the sail, and went away before the wind along the coast.</s> <s>In two hours they had run to the eastern end of the island, and hauled up close inshore: the point which ran out, and at the end of which there was an inlet, was not a mile from them, and in a very short time they had lowered the sail, and were pulling in for the sandy beach.</s> </p>

<p pid="574" id="masterman.c0.p574"><s>"You see, William, it is fortunate for us that we shall always have a fair wind when we come down loaded, and only have to pull our empty boat back again."</s> </p>

<p pid="577" id="masterman.c0.p577" type="speech"><s>The boat was soon unloaded, but they had some way to carry up the things.</s> <s>"We shall not mind such a gale as we had the other day when our tents are pitched here, William," said Ready, <qs/>"for we shall be protected by the whole width of the cocoa-nut grove.</s> <s>We shall hardly feel the wind, although we shall the rain, for that will come down in torrents."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="580" id="masterman.c0.p580"><s>They very soon pulled in to the beach, and, landing, received the congratulations of the whole party at their first successful voyage, and all expressed their delight at its having proved so much shorter than had been anticipated.</s> </p>

<p pid="873" id="masterman.c0.p873"><s>"Of course, you wish to know who my father and mother were: that is soon told.</s> <s>My father was the captain of a merchant vessel, which traded from South Shields to Hamburg, and my poor mother, God bless her, was the daughter of a half-pay militia captain, who died about two months after their marriage.</s> <s>The property which the old gentleman had bequeathed to my mother was added to that which my father had already vested in the brig, and he then owned one-third of the vessel; the other two-thirds were the property of a very rich ship-builder and owner, of the name of Masterman.</s> <s>What with the profits of the share he held of the vessel and his pay as captain, my father was well to do.</s> <s>Mr Masterman, who had a very high opinion of my father, and gained much money by his exertions and good management, was present at the marriage, and when I was born, about a year afterwards, he stood for me as godfather.</s> <s>Every one considered that this was a most advantageous circumstance for me, and congratulated my father and mother; for Mr Masterman was a bachelor, of nearly sixty years, without any near relations.</s> <s>It is true, that he was very fond of money; but that, they said, was all the better, as he could not take it away with him when he died.</s> <s>An end, however, was soon put to all their worldly ideas, for a year after I was born, my father was drowned at sea, his vessel and the whole of her crew being lost on the Texel sands; and my mother found herself a widow, with a child scarcely weaned, when she was but twenty-two years of age.</s> </p>

<p pid="874" id="masterman.c0.p874"><s>"It was supposed that my mother would still have sufficient to live upon, as the ship had been insured at two-thirds of her value; but, to the astonishment of everybody, Mr Masterman contrived to make it appear that it was his two-thirds of the vessel which had been insured."</s> </p>

<p pid="875" id="masterman.c0.p875"><s>"What is insurance?" inquired William.</s> </p>

<p pid="876" id="masterman.c0.p876"><s>"Insurance, my dear boy, is paying a certain sum to people who are called underwriters, that in case the vessel or cargo is lost or damaged, the loss or damage is made good to the owners of the vessel or cargo.</s> <s>You pay in proportion to the risk incurred.</s> <s>Supposing you wished to insure one thousand pounds on a vessel or cargo, and ten per cent was required, you would, if the vessel came home safe, pay the underwriters one hundred pounds; if, on the contrary, the vessel was lost, the underwriters would have to pay you one thousand pounds, the sum which you had insured.</s> <s>I beg your pardon for the interruption, Ready."</s> </p>

<p pid="877" id="masterman.c0.p877"><s>"No need, Mr Seagrave; we never should lose an opportunity of teaching the young.</s> <s>Well, how far the assertion of Mr Masterman was correct or not, it was impossible at the time to say; but I do know that everybody cried out `shame', and that if he did deprive the widow, he had much to answer for; for the Bible says, `Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and to keep yourself unspotted in the world'.</s> <s>The consequence was, that my mother had little or nothing to live upon; but she found friends who assisted her, and she worked embroidery, and contrived to get on somehow until I was eight or nine years of age."</s> </p>

<p pid="878" id="masterman.c0.p878"><s>"But did not your godfather come forward to the assistance of your mother?" inquired Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="879" id="masterman.c0.p879"><s>"No, sir, strange to say, he did not; and that made people talk the more.</s> <s>I believe it was the abuse of him, which he did not fail to hear, and which he ascribed to my mother, which turned him away from us; perhaps it was his own conscience, for we always dislike those we have injured."</s> </p>

<p pid="880" id="masterman.c0.p880" type="speech"><s>"Unfortunately, there is great truth in that remark of yours, Ready," observed Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"still, it is strange that he did not do something."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="881" id="masterman.c0.p881"><s>"It was very strange, sir,--at least, so it appeared at the time, but he was very fond of money, and irritated at the reports and observations which were made about him.</s> <s>But, to go on, sir, I was a strong, hardy boy, and, whenever I could escape from my mother or school, was always found by the water-side or on board of the vessels.</s> <s>In the summer-time I was half the day in water, and was a very good swimmer.</s> <s>My mother perceived my fondness for the profession, and tried all she could to divert my thoughts some other way.</s> <s>She told me of the dangers and hardships which sailors went through, and always ended with my father's death and a flood of tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="882" id="masterman.c0.p882"><s>"We certainly are of a perverse nature, as I have often heard the clergyman say, for it appears to me that we always wish to do that which we are told not to do.</s> <s>If my mother had not been always persuading me against going to sea, I really believe I might have stayed at home.</s> <s>I've often thought since, how selfish and unfeeling I must have been.</s> <s>I was too young to know what pain I was giving my mother, and how anxiety was preying upon her, all on my account.</s> <s>Children cannot feel it; if they did, they would do otherwise, for our hearts are seldom hard until we grow older."</s> </p>

<p pid="883" id="masterman.c0.p883"><s>"I agree with you, Ready," said Mr Seagrave.</s> <s>"If children really knew how much their parents suffer when they behave ill, how alarmed they are at any proofs of wickedness in them, they would be much better."</s> </p>

<p pid="884" id="masterman.c0.p884"><s>"We never find that out, sir, till it is too late," continued Ready.</s> <s>"Well, sir, I was little more than nine years old, when, on a very windy day, and the water rough, a hawser, by which a vessel was fast to the wharf, was carried away with a violent jerk, and the broken part, as it flew out, struck a person who was at the edge of the wharf, and knocked him into the sea.</s> <s>I heard the crying out, and the men from the wharf and from the ships were throwing ropes to him, but he could not catch hold of them; indeed, he could not swim well, and the water was rough.</s> <s>I caught a rope that had been hauled in again, and leapt off the wharf.</s> </p>

<p pid="885" id="masterman.c0.p885"><s>"Young as I was, I swam like a duck, and put the rope into his hands just as he was going down.</s> <s>He clung to it as drowning men only can cling, and was hauled to the piles, and soon afterwards a boat, which had been lowered from the stern of one of the vessels, picked us both up.</s> <s>We were taken to a public-house, and put into bed till dry clothes could be sent for us; and then I found that the person I had saved was my godfather, Mr Masterman.</s> <s>Everyone was loud in my praise; and, although perhaps I ought not to say it, it was a bold act for so young a boy as I was.</s> <s>The sailors took me home to my mother in a sort of triumphal procession; and she, poor thing, when she heard what I had done, embraced me over and over again, one moment rejoicing at my preservation, and the next weeping bitterly at the thoughts of the danger I had encountered, and the probability that my bold spirit would lead me into still greater."</s> </p>

<p pid="886" id="masterman.c0.p886"><s>"But she did not blame you for what you had done?"</s> </p>

<p pid="887" id="masterman.c0.p887"><s>"Oh no, William; she felt that I had done my duty towards my neighbour, and perhaps she felt in her own heart that I had returned good for evil; but she did not say so.</s> <s>The next day Mr Masterman called upon us; he certainly looked very foolish and confused when he asked for his godson, whom he had so long neglected.</s> <s>My mother, who felt how useful he might be to me, received him very kindly; but I had been often told of his neglect of me and my mother, and of his supposed unfair conduct towards my father, and had taken a violent dislike to him; his advances towards me were therefore very coolly received.</s> <s>I felt glad that I had saved him; but although I could not exactly understand my own feelings at the time, I am ashamed to say that my pleasure was not derived from having done a good action, so much as indulging a feeling of revenge in having put one under an obligation who had treated me ill; this arose from my proud spirit, which my mother could not check.</s> <s>So you see, William, there was very little merit in what I had done, as, after I had done it, I indulged those feelings which I ought to have checked."</s> </p>

<p pid="888" id="masterman.c0.p888"><s>"I think I could not have helped feeling the same, Ready, under such circumstances," replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1008" id="masterman.c0.p1008"><s>"There were, as I told you, some other boys as well as myself, who belonged to the Indiaman, and we kept very much together, not only because we were more of an age, but because we had been shipmates so long.</s> <s>Two of these boys, one of whom I have mentioned as Jack Romer, and the other Will Hastings, were my particular friends; and one day, as we were sitting under the wall warming ourselves, for it was winter time, Romer said, `How very easy it would be for us to get away, if we only knew where to go to!'</s> </p>

<p pid="1009" id="masterman.c0.p1009"><s>"`Yes,' replied Hastings; `but where are we to go to, if it is not to the Hottentots and wild savages; and when we get there, what can we do?--we can't get any further.'</s> <s>`Well,' said I, `I would rather be living free among savages, than be shut up in a prison.'</s> <s>That was our first talk on the subject, but we had many others afterwards; and as the one or two Dutch soldiers who stood sentry spoke English, and we could talk a little Dutch, we obtained a good deal of information from them; for they had very often been sent to the frontiers of the colony.</s> <s>We continued to ask questions, and to talk among ourselves for about two months, and at last we resolved that we would make our escape.</s> <s>We should have done much better if we had remained where we were; but there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders.</s> <s>We saved up our provisions, bought some long Dutch knives, tied our few clothes up in bundles, and one dark night we contrived to remain in the yard without being perceived, when the prisoners were locked up; and raising a long pole, which lay in the yard, to the top of the wall, with a good deal of scrambling we contrived to get over it, and made off as fast as we could for the Table Mountain."</s> </p>

<p pid="1010" id="masterman.c0.p1010"><s>"What was your reason for going there, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1011" id="masterman.c0.p1011"><s>"Why, Hastings, who was the oldest, and, I will say, the sharpest of the three, said that we had better stay up there for a few days, till we had made up our minds what to do, and try if we could not procure a musket or two, and ammunition; for, you see, we had money, as, when the Indiaman was first taken, the captain divided a keg of rupees, which was on board, among the officers and men, in proportion to the wages due to them, thinking it was better for the crew to have the money than to leave it for the Frenchmen; and we had spent very little while in prison.</s> <s>There was also another reason why he persuaded us to go to the Table Mountain, which was, that as soon as our escape was found out, they would send parties to look for us; thinking, of course, that we had made for the interior; and we should have less chance of being retaken if we travelled after the first search was over.</s> <s>The soldiers had told us of the lions, and other wild animals, and how dangerous it was to travel, and Hastings said, that not finding us, they would suppose we had been destroyed by the wild beasts, and would not look for us any more."</s> </p>

<p pid="1013" id="masterman.c0.p1013"><s>"True enough, madam," replied Ready.</s> <s>"We ran at first until we were out of breath, and then we walked on as fast as we could--not going right up the mountain, but keeping a slanting direction to the south-west, so as to get away from the town, and more towards False Bay.</s> </p>

<p pid="1014" id="masterman.c0.p1014"><s>"We had walked about four hours, and began to feel very tired, when the day dawned, and then we looked out for a place to conceal ourselves in.</s> <s>We soon found a cave with a narrow entrance, large enough inside to hold half-a-dozen of such lads as we were, and we crawled in.</s> <s>It was quite dry, and, as we were very tired, we lay down with our heads on our bundles, intending to take a nap; but we had hardly made ourselves comfortable and shut our eyes, when we heard such a screaming and barking that we were frightened out of our lives almost.</s> <s>We could not think what it could be.</s> <s>At last Hastings peeped out, and began to laugh; so Romer and I looked out also, and there we saw about one hundred and fifty large baboons leaping and tumbling about in such a way as I never saw; they were bigger than we were--indeed, when they stood on their hind legs they were much taller, and they had very large white tusks.</s> <s>Some of them were females, with young ones on their backs, and they were just as active as the males.</s> <s>At last they played such antics, that we all burst out into a loud laugh, and we had not ceased when we found the grinning face of one of the largest of those brutes close to our own.</s> <s>He had dropped from the rock above us, like magic.</s> <s>We all three backed into the cave, very much frightened, for the teeth of the animal were enormous, and he looked very savage.</s> <s>He gave a shrill cry, and we perceived all the rest of the herd coming to him as fast as they could.</s> <s>I said that the cave was large enough to hold six of us; but there was a sort of inner cave which we had not gone into, as the entrance was much smaller.</s> <s>Romer cried out, `Let us go into the inside cave--we can get in one by one;' and he backed in; Hastings followed with his bundle, and I hurried in after him just in time; for the baboons, who had been chattering to each other for half a minute, came into the outer cave just as I crawled into the inner.</s> <s>Five or six of them came in, all males, and very large.</s> <s>The first thing they did was to lay hold of Romer's bundle, which they soon opened--at once they seized his provisions and rammed them into their pouches, and then they pulled out the other things and tore them all to pieces.</s> <s>As soon as they had done with the bundle, two of them came towards the inner cave and saw us.</s> <s>One put his long paw in to seize us; but Hastings gave him a slash with his knife, and the animal took his paw out again fast enough.</s> <s>It was laughable to see him hold out his hand to the others, and then taste the blood with the tip of his tongue, and such a chattering I never heard--they were evidently very angry, and more came into the cave and joined them; then another put in his hand, and received a cut just as before.</s> <s>At last, two or three at once tried to pull us out, but we beat them all off with our knives, wounding them all very severely.</s> <s>For about an hour they continued their attempts, and then they went away out of the cave, but remained at the mouth shrieking and howling.</s> <s>We began to be very tired of this work, and Romer said that he wished he was back in prison again; and so did I, I can assure you; but there was no getting out, for had we gone out the animals would have torn us to pieces.</s> <s>We agreed that we had no chance but the animals becoming tired and going away; and most anxious we were, for the excitement had made us very thirsty, and we wanted water.</s> <s>We remained for two hours in this way imprisoned by baboons, when all of a sudden a shrill cry was given by one of the animals, and the whole herd went galloping off as fast as they could, screaming louder than ever.</s> <s>We waited for a short time to see if they would return, and then Hastings crawled out first, and looking out of the cave very cautiously, said that they were all gone, and that he could see nothing but a Hottentot sitting down watching some cattle; we therefore all came out, very happy at our release.</s> <s>That was our first adventure; we had plenty afterwards; but I think it is now time we should go to bed.</s> <s>It is my opinion we shall have a fine day to-morrow, sir; but there's no saying."</s> </p>

<p pid="1049" id="masterman.c0.p1049"><s>"Why, sir, I think we had better all set to, to collect the branches and ends of the cocoa-nut trees cut down, and stack them for fuel.</s> <s>Tommy and Juno have already made a good large pile, and I think, by to-night, we shall have made the stack, and so arranged it that the rain will not get into it much.</s> <s>After that, as the weather will not permit us to leave the house for any time, we will cut our salt-pan and make our fish-pond; they will take a week at least, and then we shall have little more to do near home.</s> <s>I think the strength of the rains is over already, and perhaps in a fortnight we may venture to walk through the wood, and examine what we have saved from the wreck."</s> </p>

<p pid="1050" id="masterman.c0.p1050"><s>"And we are to explore the island; are we not, Ready?" said William.</s> <s>"I long to do that."</s> </p>

<p pid="1051" id="masterman.c0.p1051"><s>"Yes, William, but that must be almost the last job; for we shall be away for two or three nights, perhaps, and we must look out for fine weather.</s> <s>We will, however, do that before we bring the stores round in the boat."</s> </p>

<p pid="1052" id="masterman.c0.p1052"><s>"But how are we to make the salt-pan, Ready?</s> <s>We must cut it out of the solid rock."</s> </p>

<p pid="1053" id="masterman.c0.p1053"><s>"Yes, William; but I have three or four of what they call cold chisels, and with one of them and a hammer, we shall get on faster than you think; for the coral rock, although hard at the surface, is soft a little below it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1054" id="masterman.c0.p1054"><s>The whole of that day was employed in piling up the cocoa-nut branches and wood.</s> <s>Ready made a square stack, like a haystack, with a gable top, over which he tied the long branches, so that the rain would pour off it.</s> </p>

<p pid="1055" id="masterman.c0.p1055" type="speech"><s>"There," said Ready, as he came down the ladder, <qs/>"that will be our provision for next year; we have quite enough left to go on with till the rainy season is over, and we shall have no difficulty in collecting it afterwards when the weather is dry."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1056" id="masterman.c0.p1056" type="speech"><s>Mr Seagrave sighed and looked grave; Ready observed it, and said, <qs/>"Mr Seagrave, it is not that we may want it; but still we must prepare for the next rainy season, in case we do want it.</s> <s>That Captain Osborn, if he lives, will send to look for us, I have no doubt; nay, I believe that Mackintosh will do the same; but still you must not forget that they all may have perished, although we have been so mercifully preserved.</s> <s>We must put our trust in God, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1057" id="masterman.c0.p1057"><s>"We must, Ready; and if it is his will, we must not murmur.</s> <s>I have schooled myself as much as possible; but thoughts will come in spite of my endeavours to restrain them."</s> </p>

<p pid="1058" id="masterman.c0.p1058"><s>"Of course they will, sir; that's natural: however, sir, you must hope for the best; fretting is no good, and it is sinful."</s> </p>

<p pid="1059" id="masterman.c0.p1059"><s>"I feel it is, Ready; and when I see how patient, and even happy, my wife is under such privations, I am angry with myself."</s> </p>

<p pid="1060" id="masterman.c0.p1060"><s>"A woman, sir, bears adversity better than a man.</s> <s>A woman is all love, and if she has but her husband and children with her, and in good health, she will make herself happy almost anywhere: but men are different: they cannot bear being shut out of the world as you are now."</s> </p>

<p pid="1061" id="masterman.c0.p1061" type="speech"><s>"It is our ambition which makes us unhappy, Ready," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"but let us say no more about it:</s> <s>God must dispose of me as he thinks fit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1062" id="masterman.c0.p1062"><s>After supper, Ready, being requested by William, continued his narrative.</s> </p>

<p pid="1063" id="masterman.c0.p1063"><s>"I left off, if I recollect right, William, just as the Hottentot, with the cattle under his care, had frightened away the baboons who were tormenting us.</s> <s>Well, we came out of the cave and sat down under the rock, so that the Hottentot could not see us, and we had a sort of council of war.</s> <s>Romer was for going back and giving ourselves up again; for he said it was ridiculous to be wandering about without any arms to defend ourselves against wild beasts, and that we might fall in with something worse than the baboons very soon; and he was right.</s> <s>It would have been the wisest thing which we could have done; but Hastings said, that if we went back we should be laughed at, and the idea of being laughed at made us all agree that we would not.</s> <s>Bear this in mind, William, and never let the fear of ridicule induce you to do what is wrong; or if you have done wrong, prevent you from returning to what is your duty."</s> </p>

<p pid="1064" id="masterman.c0.p1064"><s>"Many thanks for your advice, Ready; I hope William will not forget it," said Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="1065" id="masterman.c0.p1065"><s>"Well, sir, such was our reason for not giving up our mad scheme; and having so decided, the next point of consultation between us was, how we were to procure arms and ammunition, which we could not do without.</s> <s>As we were talking this over, I peeped from behind the rock to see where the Hottentot might be; I perceived that he had laid himself down, and wrapped himself up in his kross, a mantle of sheep-skins which they always wear.</s> <s>Now we had observed that he carried his musket in his hand, when we first saw him, as the Hottentots always go out armed, and I pointed out to Hastings and Romer that if he was asleep, we might get possession of his musket without his perceiving it.</s> <s>This was a good idea, and Hastings said he would crawl to him on his hands and knees, while we remained behind the rock.</s> <s>He did so very cautiously, and found the man's head covered up in his kross and fast asleep; so there was no fear, for the Hottentots are very hard to wake at any time; that we knew well.</s> <s>Hastings first took the musket and carried it away out of the reach of the Hottentot, and then he returned to him, cut the leather thong which slung his powder-horn and ammunition, and retreated with all of them without disturbing the man from his sleep.</s> <s>We were quite overjoyed at this piece of good luck, and determined to walk very cautiously some distance from where the Hottentot lay, that in case he awoke he should not see us.</s> <s>Keeping our eyes about in every direction, lest we should meet with anybody else, we proceeded nearly a mile towards Table Bay, when we fell in with a stream of water.</s> <s>This was another happy discovery, for we were very thirsty; so we concealed ourselves near the stream after we had quenched our thirst, and made a dinner off the provisions we had brought with us."</s> </p>

<p pid="1066" id="masterman.c0.p1066"><s>"But, Ready, did you not do wrong to steal the Hottentot's musket?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1067" id="masterman.c0.p1067"><s>"No, William; in that instance it could not be considered as a theft.</s> <s>We were in an enemy's country, trying to escape; we were therefore just as much at war with the country as we were when they took us prisoners, and we no more stole the musket than they could be said to have stolen our ship.</s> <s>Am I not right, Mr Seagrave?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1068" id="masterman.c0.p1068"><s>"I believe you are justified in what may seem extreme acts for the recovery of your liberty, after you have been made prisoners.</s> <s>It has always been so considered."</s> </p>

<p pid="1069" id="masterman.c0.p1069"><s>"Well, sir, to go on: we waited till dusk, and then we continued our march towards False Bay as fast as we could.</s> <s>We knew that there were farmers down in the valley, or rather on the sides of the hills, and we hoped to obtain, by some means or other, two more muskets.</s> <s>It was near twelve o'clock at night, with a bright moon, when we had a sight of the water in False Bay, and soon afterwards we heard the baying of a large dog, and not far from us we distinguished two or three farmhouses, with their cattle-folds and orchards.</s> <s>We then looked for a hiding-place, where we might remain till the morning; we found one between some large pieces of rock.</s> <s>We agreed that one should watch while the other two slept; this Hastings undertook to do, as he was not inclined to sleep.</s> <s>At daylight he woke Romer and me, and we made our breakfast.</s> <s>From the place we were concealed in, we had a bird's-eye view of the farmhouse, and of what was going on.</s> </p>

<p pid="1070" id="masterman.c0.p1070"><s>"The farmhouse and buildings just below us were much smaller than the other two, which were more distant.</s> <s>We watched the people as they went about.</s> <s>In about an hour the Hottentots came out, and we perceived that they were yoking the oxen to the waggon; they yoked twelve pair, and then the Hottentot driver got in and drove off towards Cape Town.</s> <s>Soon after that, another Hottentot drove the cows up the valley to feed; and then a Dutch woman came out of the house with two children, and fed the poultry.</s> </p>

<p pid="1071" id="masterman.c0.p1071"><s>"We watched for another hour, and then the farmer himself made his appearance, with a pipe in his mouth, and sat down on a bench.</s> <s>When his pipe was out, he called to the house, and a Hottentot woman came to him with more tobacco and a light.</s> <s>During the whole of the day we did not see any other people about the house, so we concluded that there were no more than the farmer, his wife, the Hottentot woman, and two children.</s> <s>About two hours after noon the farmer went to the stable and led out his horse, mounted, and rode away; we saw him speak to the Hottentot woman when he rode off, and she soon after went down the valley with a basket on her head, and a long knife in her hand.</s> <s>Then Hastings said it was time that we moved, for there was but one woman in the house, and we could easily overpower her and get what we wanted; still there was a great risk, as she might give the alarm, and we should have to escape in the day-time, and might be seen and taken prisoners again.</s> <s>However, as it was our only chance, we resolved to go down to the farmhouse very cautiously, and be all ready to seize any opportunity.</s> <s>We crept down the hill, and gained the fence, which was at the back of the farmhouse, without being discovered: we remained there for about a quarter of an hour, when, to our great joy, we observed the farmer's wife go out of the house, leading a child in each hand; apparently she was going to visit one of her neighbours, for she went in the direction of one of the other farms.</s> <s>As soon as she was a hundred yards off, Hastings crept softly through the fence, and entered the farmhouse by the back-door; he came out again, and made a sign for us to come in.</s> <s>We found him already in possession of a rifle and a musket, which had been hanging over the fire-place, and we soon handed down the powder-horns and ammunition pouches, which were hung up at a different part of the room, away from the fire-place.</s> </p>

<p pid="1072" id="masterman.c0.p1072"><s>"Having gained these, Hastings set me to watch at the front door, lest anybody should return, while Romer and he looked out for something else in the way of provisions.</s> <s>We got possession of three hams, and a large loaf of bread as big as a small washing-tub.</s> <s>With these articles we made our way safe back to our retreat.</s> <s>We then looked round, and could see nobody in any direction, so we presumed that we were not discovered.</s> <s>As there was a sort of ravine full of rocks dividing the hill, which we were obliged to pass before we could get into the valley, unless we went down close to the farmhouse, we agreed that it would be better at once to cross it during the day-time, so that we should get that difficulty over, and, at the same time, be further from the farmhouse.</s> <s>We did so; and found a very secure hiding-place, where we lay down, waiting for the sun to set before we started on our journey into the interior.</s> <s>I think I had better leave off now, William, as it is getting late."</s> </p>

<p pid="1073" id="masterman.c0.p1073"><s>CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.</s> </p>

<p pid="1074" id="masterman.c0.p1074"><s>The fishpond was commenced the next morning.</s> <s>Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William went down together to the beach, and, after much examination, chose a spot about one hundred yards from the turtle-pond as most eligible for the purpose; the water being shallow, so that at the part farthest from the shore there would not be more than three feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1075" id="masterman.c0.p1075" type="speech"><s>"Now, sir," said Ready, <qs/>"this is a very simple job; all we have to do is to collect small rocks and stones, pile them up wall-fashion inside, and with a slope outside, so as to break the force of the waves when the water is a little rough; of course, the water will find its way through the stones, and will be constantly changed.</s> <s>It's very true, that we can at most times catch fish when we want them, but it is not always that we can spare the time, so it's just as well to have always a certain quantity at hand, to take out at a moment's warning; and we can, of course, catch them and put them in here when we have nothing else to do.</s> <s>Juno will be able to come down and take them out with a spear, when we are away and she wants something for dinner."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1076" id="masterman.c0.p1076"><s>"But there are few stones about here, Ready; we shall have to fetch them a long way," said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1077" id="masterman.c0.p1077"><s>"Well, then, William, let us get the wheels down here, and then we can carry a quantity at a time."</s> </p>

<p pid="1078" id="masterman.c0.p1078"><s>"But how shall we carry them, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1079" id="masterman.c0.p1079"><s>"We will sling a tub on the axle; I will go up and get that ready and bring it down; in the meantime, you and Mr Seagrave can collect all the stones which are near at hand."</s> </p>

<p pid="1080" id="masterman.c0.p1080"><s>Ready soon returned with the wheels, and the tub slung with rope on the axle, and by that means they found that they could collect the stones very fast; Mr Seagrave and William bringing them, and Ready in the water, building up the wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="1081" id="masterman.c0.p1081" type="speech"><s>"We have quite forgot another job which we must put in hand, sir," observed Ready; <qs/>"but the fish-pond reminds me of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1082" id="masterman.c0.p1082"><s>"What is that, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1083" id="masterman.c0.p1083"><s>"A bathing-place for the children, and indeed for us all; we shall want it when the hot weather comes on, but we will put it off till then.</s> <s>I can tell you, sir, that although I don't mind building this wall in the shallow water, I shall be very careful when the water is up to my knees, for you don't know how bold the sharks are in these latitudes.</s> <s>When I was at St.</s> <s>Helena, not very long ago, we had a melancholy proof of it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1084" id="masterman.c0.p1084"><s>"Tell us the story, Ready."</s> </p>

<p pid="1085" id="masterman.c0.p1085"><s>"Well, two soldiers were standing on the rocks at St.</s> <s>Helena; the rocks were out of the water, but the swell just broke over them.</s> <s>Two sharks swam up to them, and one of them, with a blow of his tail, turning round the same way, tripped one of them into the water, which was very deep.</s> <s>His comrade was very much frightened, and ran to the barracks to tell the story.</s> <s>About a week afterwards, a schooner was in Sandy Bay, on the other side of the island, and the people seeing a very large shark under the stern, put out a hook with a piece of pork, and caught him; they opened him, and found inside of him, to their horror, the whole of the body of the soldier, except the legs below the knees: the monster had swallowed him whole, with the exception of his legs, which it had nipped off when it closed its jaws."</s> </p>

<p pid="1086" id="masterman.c0.p1086"><s>"I really had no idea that they were so bold, Ready."</s> </p>

<p pid="1087" id="masterman.c0.p1087"><s>"It is a fact, I assure you; and therefore we cannot be too careful how we go into the water: you saw how soon the poor pig was despatched."</s> </p>

<p pid="1088" id="masterman.c0.p1088"><s>"I wonder how the pigs get on, Ready," said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1089" id="masterman.c0.p1089"><s>"I dare say they have littered by this time, sir; they have no want of food."</s> </p>

<p pid="1090" id="masterman.c0.p1090"><s>"But can they eat the cocoa-nuts?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1091" id="masterman.c0.p1091"><s>"Not the old ones, but they can the young ones, which are constantly dropping from the trees, and then there's plenty of roots for them.</s> <s>If we stay long here we shall soon have good sport hunting them; but we must be very careful; for although they were tame pigs when we brought them on shore, they will be wild and very savage in a very short time."</s> </p>

<p pid="1092" id="masterman.c0.p1092"><s>"How must we hunt them?" said Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="1093" id="masterman.c0.p1093"><s>"Why, sir, with the dogs, and then shoot them.</s> <s>I am glad that Vixen will have pups soon; we shall want more dogs."</s> </p>

<p pid="1094" id="masterman.c0.p1094"><s>"Shall we not have more mouths than we can find food for?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1095" id="masterman.c0.p1095"><s>"Never fear that, sir, as long as we have the sea to fish in.</s> <s>Dogs live very well upon fish, even if it is raw."</s> </p>

<p pid="1096" id="masterman.c0.p1096"><s>"We shall have some lambs soon, Ready, shall we not?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1097" id="masterman.c0.p1097"><s>"Yes, sir, I expect very soon.</s> <s>I wish we had more food for the animals: they are put rather hard to it just now; but next year, if we find more food on the island, we must keep the grass near home, to make hay and stack it for the winter time--or the rainy season rather, for there is no winter in these latitudes.</s> <s>I'm pretty sure we shall find some clear land on the south of the island, for the cocoa-nut grove does not extend so close to the water on that side as it does on the north."</s> </p>

<p pid="1098" id="masterman.c0.p1098"><s>"I do so long to go on our exploring party," said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1099" id="masterman.c0.p1099" type="speech"><s>"We must wait a little," replied Ready; <qs/>"but I don't know whether you will go; we must not all three go at once, and leave Mrs Seagrave alone."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1100" id="masterman.c0.p1100" type="speech"><s>"No," replied Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"that would not be fair; either you or I must remain, William."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1101" id="masterman.c0.p1101"><s>William made no reply, but it was evident that he was annoyed at the idea of not being of the party.</s> <s>They worked very hard that day, and the walls rose fast out of the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="1102" id="masterman.c0.p1102"><s>After supper, Ready continued his narrative.</s> <s>"We remained concealed until it was dark, and then Hastings and Romer, each with a musket on his shoulders and a ham at his back; and I, being the smallest, with the rifle and the great loaf of bread, set off on our journey.</s> <s>Our intention was to travel north, as we knew that was the road leading from the colony; but Hastings had decided that we should first go to the eastward, so as to make what we sailors call a circumbendibus, which would keep us out of the general track.</s> <s>We passed through the deep sands of False Bay, and after that gradually ascended, getting among brushwood and young trees; but we saw no signs of cultivation, nor did we pass one house after we had left False Bay astern of us.</s> <s>About twelve o'clock we were very much fatigued, and longed for a drink of water, but we did not find any, although the moon shone as bright as day.</s> <s>We distinctly heard, however, what we did not much like, the howling and cries of the wild beasts which increased as we went on; still we did not see any, and that was our comfort.</s> <s>At last we were so tired that we all sat down on the ledge of a rock.</s> <s>We dared not go to sleep, so we remained there till daylight, listening to the howling of the animals.</s> <s>We none of us spoke, and I presume that Hastings' and Romer's thoughts were the same as my own, which were, that I would have given a great deal to find myself safe and sound again within the prison walls.</s> <s>However, daylight came at last; the wild beasts did not prowl any more; we walked on till we found a stream of water, where we sat down and took our breakfast, after which our courage revived, and we talked and laughed as we walked on, just as we had done before.</s> <s>We now began to ascend the mountains, which Hastings said must be the Black Mountains that the soldiers had talked to us about.</s> <s>They were very desolate; and when night came on we collected brushwood, and cut down branches with our knives, that we might make a fire, not only to warm ourselves, but to scare away the wild beasts, whose howling had already commenced.</s> <s>We lighted our fire and ate our supper; the loaf was half gone, and the hams had been well cut into--we knew, therefore, that very soon we should have to trust to our guns for procuring food.</s> <s>As soon as we had finished our meal, we lay down by the fire, with our muskets loaded close to us, and our ammunition placed out of danger.</s> <s>We were so tired that we were soon fast asleep.</s> <s>It had been agreed that Romer should keep the first watch, and Hastings the middle, and I the morning; but Romer fell asleep, and the consequence was, that the fire was not kept up.</s> <s>It was about midnight that I was awakened by something breathing hard in my face, and just as I could recall my senses and open my eyes, I found myself lifted up by my waistband, and the teeth of some animal pinching my flesh.</s> <s>I tried to catch at my musket, but I put out my wrong hand, and laid hold of a still lighted brand out of the fire, which I darted into the animal's face; it let me drop directly, and ran away."</s> </p>

<p pid="1103" id="masterman.c0.p1103"><s>"What a providential escape!" said Mrs Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="1104" id="masterman.c0.p1104"><s>"Yes, it was, ma'am; the animal was a hyena.</s> <s>Fortunately they are a very cowardly sort of beast; still, had it not been for the lighted stick, it would have carried me off, for I was very small then, and it lifted me up as if I was a feather in its mouth.</s> <s>The shout I gave woke Hastings, who seized his musket and fired.</s> <s>I was very much frightened, as you may suppose.</s> <s>As for Romer, he never woke till we pushed him hard, he was so completely knocked up.</s> <s>This affair, of course, made us more cautious, and afterwards we lighted two fires, and slept between them, one always remaining on the watch.</s> <s>For a week we travelled on, and as soon as we were over the mountains, we turned our heads to the northward.</s> <s>Our provisions were all gone, and we were one day without any; but we killed an antelope called a spring-bock, which gave us provisions for three or four days: there was no want of game after we had descended into the plain.</s> <s>I forgot to mention, however, a narrow escape we had, just before we had left an extensive forest on the side of the mountain.</s> <s>We had walked till past noon, and were very much tired; we decided upon taking our dinner under a large tree, and we threw ourselves down in the shade.</s> <s>Hastings was lying on his back, with his eyes looking upwards, when he perceived on the lower branch of the tree a panther, which lay along it, his green eyes fixed upon us, and ready to spring; he seized his musket, and fired it without taking aim, for there was no time; but the ball entered the stomach of the animal, and, as it appeared, divided its back-bone.</s> <s>Down came the beast, within three or four feet of where we lay, with a loud roar, and immediately crouched to spring upon Romer; but it could not, for the back-bone being broken, it had not any power in its hinder quarters, so it raised up its fore quarters, and then dropped down again.</s> <s>I never saw such rage and fury in an animal in my life.</s> <s>At first we were too much frightened to fire; but, perceiving that the beast could not spring, Hastings snatched the musket from Romer and shot it through the head.</s> </p>

<p pid="1105" id="masterman.c0.p1105"><s>"We were now obliged to hunt for our livelihood, and we became bolder than ever.</s> <s>Our clothes were all in rags; but we had plenty of powder and ammunition; there were hundreds and hundreds of antelopes and gnus in the plain--indeed, sometimes it was impossible to count them.</s> <s>But this plentiful supply of game was the cause of our being in greater danger, for now, for the first time, we heard the roar of the lions every night.</s> <s>We made large fires to keep them off, but they often made us tremble when they came near to us."</s> </p>

<p pid="1106" id="masterman.c0.p1106"><s>"Did you ever meet with one in the day-time?" said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1121" id="masterman.c0.p1121"><s>"A wild ass, partly covered with stripes, but not so much as the zebra; a pretty animal to look at, but the flesh is very bad.</s> <s>At last he would give us nothing to eat but quaggas, the same as the Hottentots, while he and his family--for he had a wife and five children--lived upon mutton and the flesh of the antelope, which is very excellent eating.</s> <s>We asked him to allow us a gun to procure better food, and he kicked Romer so unmercifully, that he could not work for two days afterwards.</s> <s>Our lives became quite a burden to us; we were employed all day on the farm, and every day he was more brutal towards us.</s> <s>At last we agreed that we would stand it no longer, and one evening Hastings told him so.</s> <s>This put him into a great rage, and he called two of the slaves, and ordered them to tie him to the waggon wheel, swearing that he would cut every bit of skin off his body, and he went into his house to get his whip.</s> <s>The slaves had hold of Hastings, and were tying him up, for they dared not disobey their master, when he said to us, `If I am flogged this way, it will be all over with us.</s> <s>Now's your time; run back behind the house, and when he comes out with the whip, do you go in and seize the muskets, which are always ready loaded.</s> <s>Hold him at bay till I get clear, and then we will get away somehow or other.</s> <s>You must do it, for I am sure he will flog me till I am dead, and he will shoot you, as runaway prisoners, as he did his two Hottentots the other day.'</s> <s>As Romer and I thought this very probable, we did as Hastings told us; and when the Dutchman had gone towards him where he was tied up, about fifty yards from the house, we went in.</s> <s>The farmer's wife was in bed, having just had an addition to her family, and the children we cared not for.</s> <s>We seized two muskets and a large knife, and came out just as the Dutchman had struck the first blow with the rhinoceros whip, which was so severe, that it took away poor Hastings' breath.</s> <s>We went up; he turned round and saw us: we levelled our muskets at him, and he stopped.</s> <s>`Another blow, and we'll shoot you,' cried Romer.</s> <s>`Yes,' cried I; `we are only boys, but you've Englishmen to deal with.'</s> <s>When we came up, Romer kept his piece levelled at the Dutchman, while I passed him, and with the knife cut the thongs which bound Hastings.</s> <s>The Dutchman turned pale and did not speak, he was so frightened, and the slaves ran away.</s> <s>As soon as Hastings was free, he seized a large wooden mallet, used for driving in stakes, and struck the Dutchman down to the earth, crying out, `That for flogging an Englishman, you rascal!'</s> </p>

<p pid="1122" id="masterman.c0.p1122"><s>"While the man lay senseless or dead--I didn't know which at the time-- we tied him to the waggon wheels, and returning to the house, seized some ammunition and other articles which might be useful.</s> <s>We then went to the stables, and took the three best horses which the Dutchman had, put some corn in a sack for each of them, took some cord for halters, mounted, and rode away as fast as we could.</s> <s>As we knew that we should be pursued, we first galloped away as if we were going eastward to the Cape; and then, as soon as we were on ground which would not show the tracks of our horses' hoofs, we turned round to the northward, in the direction of the Bushman country.</s> <s>It was dark soon after we had altered our course; but we travelled all night, and although we heard the roaring of the lions at a distance, we met with no accident.</s> <s>At daylight we rested our horses, and gave them some corn, and then sat down to eat some of the provision we had brought with us."</s> </p>

<p pid="1123" id="masterman.c0.p1123"><s>"How long were you with the farmer at Graaff Reinet?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1124" id="masterman.c0.p1124"><s>"Nearly eight months, sir; and during that time we could not only speak Dutch, but we could make ourselves understood by the Hottentots and other natives.</s> <s>While we were eating we held a consultation how we should proceed.</s> <s>We were aware that the Dutchmen would shoot us if they came up with us, and that they would come out in strong force against us; and we were afraid that we had killed the man, and if so, they would hang us as soon as we got to the Cape; so we were at a great loss to know how to act.</s> <s>At last we decided that we would cross the country of the Bushmen, and get to the sea-side, to the northward of the Cape.</s> <s>We determined that it would be better to travel at night, as there would be less fear of the wild beasts, or of being seen; so we went fast asleep for many hours.</s> <s>Towards the evening, we found water for the horses, and then we fed them again, and proceeded on our journey.</s> <s>I won't tell what passed every day for a fortnight, by which time we had pretty well killed our horses, and we were compelled to stop among a tribe of Gorraguas, a very mild, inoffensive people, who supplied us with milk, and treated us very kindly.</s> <s>We had some adventures, nevertheless.</s> <s>One day as we were passing by a tuft of small trees, a rhinoceros charged upon my horse, which very narrowly escaped by wheeling short round and getting behind him; the beast then made off without meddling with us any more.</s> <s>Every day we used to shoot some animal or other, for provision: sometimes it was a gnu, something between an antelope and a bull; at other times it was one of the antelope kind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1125" id="masterman.c0.p1125"><s>"Well, we stayed for three weeks with these people, and gave our horses time to refresh themselves; and then we set off again, keeping more towards the coast as we went southward, for the Gorraguas told us that there was a fierce native tribe, called Kaffers, to the northward, who would certainly kill us if we went there.</s> <s>The fact is, we did not know what to do.</s> <s>We had left the Cape without any exact idea where we should go to, like foolish boys as we were, and we became more entangled with difficulties every day.</s> <s>At last we decided that it would be better to find our way back to the Cape, and deliver ourselves up as prisoners, for we were tired out with fatigue and constant danger.</s> <s>All that we were afraid of was that we had killed the Dutch farmer at Graaff Reinet, who had treated us so brutally; but Hastings said he did not care; that was his business, and he would take his chance: so when we bade adieu to the Gorraguas, we turned our horses' heads to the south-east, so as to make the sea and go to the southward at the same time.</s> </p>

<p pid="1126" id="masterman.c0.p1126"><s>"I have now to mention a most melancholy event which occurred.</s> <s>Two days after we had recommenced our travels, in passing through some high grass, we stumbled on a lion, which was devouring a gnu.</s> <s>Romer, who happened to be some ten yards foremost of the three, was so alarmed that he fired at the animal, which we had agreed never to do, as it was folly to enrage so powerful a beast, when our party was so small.</s> <s>The lion was slightly wounded; he gave a roar that might have been heard for a mile, sprang upon Romer, and with one blow of his paw knocked him off the saddle into the bushes.</s> <s>Our horses, which were frightened, wheeled round and fled, for the animal was evidently about to attack us.</s> <s>As it was, he did make one bound in our direction; we could not pull up until we had gone half a mile; and when we did, we saw the lion had torn down the horse which Romer had ridden, and was dragging away the carcass to the right at a sort of a canter, without any apparent effort on his part.</s> <s>We waited till he was well off, and then rode back to the spot where Romer had fallen: we soon found him, but he was quite dead; the blow with the lion's paw had fractured his skull.</s> </p>

<p pid="1127" id="masterman.c0.p1127"><s>"I ought to have said that the Gorraguas told us not to travel by night, but by day; and we had done so in consequence of their advice.</s> <s>I believe it was very good advice, notwithstanding this unfortunate accident, for we found that when we had travelled all night the lions had more than once followed us the whole time; and indeed I have often thought since that we were altogether indebted to his mercy who ordereth all things, both in heaven and earth, that we escaped so well as we did.</s> <s>Three days after poor Romer's death we first saw the wide ocean again.</s> <s>We kept near the coast, but we soon found that we could not obtain the supply of game, or fuel for our fires at night, so well as we could in the interior, and we agreed to get away from the coast again.</s> <s>We had a dreary plain to pass over, and we were quite faint for want of food--for we had been without any for nearly two days--when we came upon an ostrich.</s> <s>Hastings put his horse to his speed, but it was of no use--the ostrich ran much faster than the horse could.</s> <s>I remained behind, and, to my great joy, discovered his nest, with thirteen large eggs in it.</s> <s>Hastings soon came back, with his horse panting and out of wind.</s> <s>We sat down, lighted a fire, and roasted two of the eggs: we made a good dinner of them, and having put four more on our saddle-bows, we continued our journey.</s> <s>At last, one forenoon, we saw the Table Mountain, and were as glad to see it as if we had seen the white cliffs of Old England.</s> <s>We pushed on our horses with the hopes of being once more comfortably in prison before night; when, as we neared the bay, we noticed that English colours were flying on board of the vessels in the road.</s> <s>This surprised us very much; but soon after that we met an English soldier, who told us that the Cape had been taken by our forces more than six months ago.</s> <s>This was a joyful surprise, as you may suppose.</s> <s>We rode into the town, and reported ourselves to the main guard; the governor sent for us, heard our story, and sent us to the admiral, who took us on board of his own ship."</s> </p>

<p pid="1136" id="masterman.c0.p1136"><s>"In the Great Andaman Isles, at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal.</s> <s>I once anchored in distress in Port Cornwallis, and the morning after we anchored, we saw some black things going upon all fours under the trees that came down to the water's edge.</s> <s>We got the telescope, and perceived then that they were men and women, for they stood upright."</s> </p>

<p pid="1137" id="masterman.c0.p1137"><s>"Did you ever come into contact with them?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1138" id="masterman.c0.p1138"><s>"No, sir, I did not; but I met, at Calcutta, a soldier who had; for at one time the East India Company intended making a settlement on the island, and sent some troops there.</s> <s>He said that they caught two of them; that they were not more than four feet high, excessively stupid and shy; they had no houses or huts to live in, and all that they did was to pile up some bushes to keep the wind off."</s> </p>

<p pid="1139" id="masterman.c0.p1139"><s>"Had they any arms?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1140" id="masterman.c0.p1140"><s>"Yes, sir, they had bows and arrows; but so miserably made, and so small, that they could not kill anything but very small birds."</s> </p>

<p pid="1142" id="masterman.c0.p1142"><s>"That is difficult to say, William; but it is supposed that they have become inhabited in much the same way as this our island has been--that is, by people in canoes or boats driven out to sea, and saving their lives by effecting a landing, as we have done."</s> </p>

<p pid="1151" id="masterman.c0.p1151"><s>"Yes, the extreme heat of the sun between the tropics rarefies the air as the earth turns round, and the trade-winds are produced by the rushing in of the less heated air."</s> </p>

<p pid="1154" id="masterman.c0.p1154"><s>"The winds, constantly following the sun across the Atlantic Ocean, and blowing from east to west, have great effect upon the sea, which is forced up into the Gulf of Mexico (where it is stopped by the shores of America), so that it is many feet higher in the Gulf than in the eastern part of the Atlantic.</s> <s>This accumulation of water must of course find a vent somewhere, and it does in what is called the Gulf Stream, by which the waters are poured out, running very strong to the northward, along the shores of America, and then [westward] eastward, passing not far from Newfoundland, until its strength is spent somewhere to the northward of the Azores."</s> </p>

<p pid="1155" id="masterman.c0.p1155" type="speech"><s>"The Gulf Stream, William," said Ready, <qs/>"is always several degrees warmer than the sea in general, which is, they say, owing to its waters remaining in the Gulf of Mexico so long, where the heat of the sun is so great."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1206" id="masterman.c0.p1206"><s>They were all up early the next morning, and breakfasted at an early hour.</s> <s>The knapsacks and guns, and the other requisites for the journey, were all prepared; William and Ready rose from the table, and taking an affectionate leave of Mr and Mrs Seagrave, they started on their journey.</s> <s>The sun was shining brilliantly, and the weather had become warm; the ocean in the distance gleamed brightly, as its waters danced, and the cocoa-nut trees moved their branches gracefully to the breeze.</s> <s>They set off in high spirits, and having called the two shepherd dogs, and driven back Vixen, who would have joined the party, they passed the storehouse, and ascending the hill on the other side, they got their hatchets ready to blaze the trees; and Ready having set his course by his pocket compass, they were fairly on their way.</s> <s>For some time they continued to cut the bark of the trees with their hatchets, without speaking, and then Ready stopped again to look at his compass.</s> </p>

<p pid="1207" id="masterman.c0.p1207"><s>"I think the wood is thicker here than ever, Ready," observed William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1208" id="masterman.c0.p1208"><s>"Yes, sir, it is; but I suspect we are now in the thickest part of it, right in the middle of the island; however, we shall soon see.</s> <s>We must keep a little more away to the southward.</s> <s>We had better get on as fast as we can.</s> <s>We shall have less work by and by, and then we can talk better."</s> </p>

<p pid="1209" id="masterman.c0.p1209"><s>For half-an-hour they continued their way through the wood, and, as Ready had observed, the trees became more distant from each other; still, however, they could not see anything before them but the stems of the cocoa-nuts.</s> <s>It was hard work, chopping the trees every second, and their foreheads were moist with the exertion.</s> </p>

<p pid="1210" id="masterman.c0.p1210"><s>"I think we had better pull up for a few minutes, William; you will be tired."</s> </p>

<p pid="1211" id="masterman.c0.p1211"><s>"I have not been so used to exercise, Ready, and therefore I feel it more," replied William, wiping his face with his handkerchief.</s> <s>"I should like to stop a few minutes.</s> <s>How long do you think it will be before we are out of the wood?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1212" id="masterman.c0.p1212"><s>"Not half-an-hour more, sir, I should think; even before that, perhaps."</s> </p>

<p pid="1214" id="masterman.c0.p1214"><s>"That's a difficult question to answer.</s> <s>I can tell you what I hope to find, which is, a good space of clear ground between the beach and the wood, where we may pasture our sheep and goats; and perhaps we may find some other trees besides cocoa-nuts: at present, you know, we have seen only them and the castor-oil beans, that Tommy took such a dose of.</s> <s>You see, William, there is no saying what new seeds may have been brought here by birds, or by the winds and waves."</s> </p>

<p pid="1215" id="masterman.c0.p1215"><s>"But will those seeds grow?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1216" id="masterman.c0.p1216"><s>"Yes, William; I have been told that seeds may remain hundreds of years under-ground, and come up afterwards when exposed to the heat."</s> </p>

<p pid="1217" id="masterman.c0.p1217" type="speech"><s>They continued their way, and had not walked for more than a quarter of an hour, when William cried out, <qs/>"I see the blue sky, Ready; we shall soon be out; and glad shall I be, for my arm aches with chopping."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1218" id="masterman.c0.p1218"><s>"I dare say it does, sir.</s> <s>I am just as glad as you are, for I'm tired of marking the trees; however, we must continue to mark, or we shall not find our way back when we want it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1219" id="masterman.c0.p1219"><s>In ten minutes more they were clear of the cocoa-nut grove, and found themselves among brushwood higher than their heads; so that they could not see how far they were from the shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="1220" id="masterman.c0.p1220" type="speech"><s>"Well," said William, throwing down his hatchet, <qs/>"I'm glad that's over; now let us sit down a little before we go any further."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1221" id="masterman.c0.p1221" type="speech"><s>"I'm of your opinion, sir," replied Ready, sitting down by the side of William; <qs/>"I feel more tired to-day than I did when we first went through the wood, after we set off from the cove.</s> <s>I suppose it's the weather.</s> <s>Come back, dogs; lie down."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1222" id="masterman.c0.p1222"><s>"The weather is very fine, Ready."</s> </p>

<p pid="1223" id="masterman.c0.p1223"><s>"Yes, now it is; but I meant to have said that the rainy season is very trying to the health, and I suppose I have not recovered from it yet.</s> <s>You have had a regular fever, and, of course, do not feel strong; but a man may have no fever, and yet his health suffer a great deal from it.</s> <s>I am an old man, William, and feel these things now."</s> </p>

<p pid="1225" id="masterman.c0.p1225"><s>"Well, we will take an early dinner, and we shall get rid of one bottle of water, at all events; indeed, I think that, as we must go back by the same way we came, we may as well leave our knapsacks and everything but our guns under these trees; I dare say we shall sleep here too, for I told Mr Seagrave positively not to expect us back to-night.</s> <s>I did not like to say so before your mother, she is so anxious about you."</s> </p>

<p pid="1226" id="masterman.c0.p1226"><s>They opened their knapsacks, and made their meal, the two dogs coming in for their share; after which they again started on their discoveries.</s> <s>For about ten minutes they continued to force their way through the thick and high bushes, till at last they broke out clear of them, and then looked around them for a short time without speaking.</s> <s>The sea was about half a mile distant, and the intervening land was clear, with fresh blades of grass just bursting out of the earth, composing a fine piece of pasture of at least fifty acres, here and there broken with small patches of trees and brushwood; there was no sandy beach, but the rocks rose from the sea about twenty to thirty feet high, and were in one or two places covered with something which looked as white as snow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1227" id="masterman.c0.p1227" type="speech"><s>"Well, Ready," said William, <qs/>"there will be no want of pasture for our flock, even if it increases to ten times its number."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1228" id="masterman.c0.p1228" type="speech"><s>"No," replied Ready, <qs/>"we are very fortunate, and have great reason to be thankful; this is exactly what we required; and now let us go on a little, and examine these patches of wood, and see what they are.</s> <s>I see a bright green leaf out there, which, if my eyes do not fail me, I have seen many a time before."<qe/></s> <s>When they arrived at the clump of trees which Ready had pointed out, he said, <qs/>"Yes, I was right.</s> <s>Look there, this is the banana; it is just bursting out now, and will soon be ten feet high, and bearing fruit which is excellent eating; besides which the stem is capital fodder for the beasts."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1229" id="masterman.c0.p1229"><s>"Here is a plant I never saw before," said William, pulling off a piece of it, and showing it to Ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="1230" id="masterman.c0.p1230"><s>"But I have, William.</s> <s>It is what they call the bird's-eye pepper; they make Cayenne pepper out of it.</s> <s>Look, the pods are just formed; it will be useful to us in cooking, as we have no pepper left.</s> <s>You see, William, we must have some birds on the island; at least it is most probable, for all the seeds of these plants and trees must have been brought here by them.</s> <s>The banana and the pepper are the food of many birds.</s> <s>What a quantity of bananas are springing up in this spot; there will be a little forest of them in a few weeks."</s> </p>

<p pid="1231" id="masterman.c0.p1231"><s>"What is that rough-looking sort of shrub out there, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1232" id="masterman.c0.p1232"><s>"I can't see so well as you, William, so let us walk up to it.</s> <s>Oh, I know it now; it is what they call the prickly pear in the West Indies.</s> <s>I am very glad to have found that, for it will be very useful to us."</s> </p>

<p pid="1233" id="masterman.c0.p1233"><s>"Is it good eating, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1234" id="masterman.c0.p1234"><s>"Not particularly; and the little spikes run into your fingers, and are very difficult to get rid of; but it is not bad by way of a change.</s> <s>No, the use it will be to us is to hedge in our garden, and protect it from the animals; it makes a capital fence, and grows very fast, and without trouble.</s> <s>Now let us go on to that patch of trees, and see what they are."</s> </p>

<p pid="1235" id="masterman.c0.p1235"><s>"What is this plant, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1236" id="masterman.c0.p1236"><s>"I don't know, William."</s> </p>

<p pid="1237" id="masterman.c0.p1237"><s>"Then I think I had better make a collection of all those you don't know, and take them back to father; he is a good botanist."</s> </p>

<p pid="1238" id="masterman.c0.p1238"><s>William pulled a branch of the plant off, and carried it with him.</s> <s>On their arrival at the next patch of trees, Ready looked at them steadfastly for some time.</s> </p>

<p pid="1239" id="masterman.c0.p1239"><s>"I ought to know that tree," said he.</s> <s>"I have often seen it in hot countries.</s> <s>Yes, it's the guava."</s> </p>

<p pid="1241" id="masterman.c0.p1241"><s>"Yes, the very same."</s> </p>

<p pid="1242" id="masterman.c0.p1242" type="speech"><s>"Let us now walk in the direction of those five or six trees," said William; <qs/>"and from there down to the rocks; I want to find out how it is that they are so white."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1243" id="masterman.c0.p1243"><s>"Be it so, if you wish," replied Ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="1244" id="masterman.c0.p1244"><s>"Why, Ready, what noise is that?</s> <s>Hark! such a chattering, it must be monkeys."</s> </p>

<p pid="1245" id="masterman.c0.p1245"><s>"No, they are not monkeys; but I'll tell you what they are, although I cannot see them; they are parrots--I know their noise well.</s> <s>You see, William, it's not very likely that monkeys should get here, but birds can, and it is the birds that we have to thank for the bananas and guavas, and other fruits we may find here."</s> </p>

<p pid="1246" id="masterman.c0.p1246"><s>As soon as they came under the trees, there was a great rioting and fluttering, and then away flew, screaming as loud as they could, a flock of about three hundred parrots, their beautiful green and blue feathers glistening in the beams of the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="1247" id="masterman.c0.p1247"><s>"I told you so; well, we'll have some capital pies out of them, William."</s> </p>

<p pid="1248" id="masterman.c0.p1248"><s>"Pies! do they make good pies, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1249" id="masterman.c0.p1249"><s>"Yes, excellent; and very often have I had a good dinner from one in the West Indies, and in South America.</s> <s>Stop, let us come a little this way; I see a leaf which I should like to examine."</s> </p>

<p pid="1250" id="masterman.c0.p1250"><s>"The ground is very swampy just here, Ready; is it not?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1251" id="masterman.c0.p1251"><s>"Yes; there's plenty of water below, I don't doubt.</s> <s>So much the better for the animals; we must dig some pools when they come here.</s> </p>

<p pid="1252" id="masterman.c0.p1252"><s>"Oh!</s> <s>I thought I was not wrong.</s> <s>Look! this is the best thing I have found yet--we now need not care so much about potatoes."</s> </p>

<p pid="1253" id="masterman.c0.p1253"><s>"Why, what are they, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1254" id="masterman.c0.p1254"><s>"Yams, which they use instead of potatoes in the West Indies.</s> <s>Indeed, potatoes do not remain potatoes long, when planted in hot climates."</s> </p>

<p pid="1255" id="masterman.c0.p1255"><s>"How do you mean, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1256" id="masterman.c0.p1256"><s>"They turn into what they call sweet-potatoes, after one or two crops: yams are better things, in my opinion."</s> </p>

<p pid="1257" id="masterman.c0.p1257"><s>At this moment the dogs dashed among the broad yam leaves, and commenced baying; there was a great rustling and snorting.</s> </p>

<p pid="1258" id="masterman.c0.p1258"><s>"What's that?" cried William, who had been stooping down to examine the yam plant, and who was startled at the noise.</s> </p>

<p pid="1259" id="masterman.c0.p1259"><s>Ready laughed heartily.</s> <s>"It isn't the first time that they've made you jump, William."</s> </p>

<p pid="1260" id="masterman.c0.p1260"><s>"Why, it's our pigs, isn't it?" replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1261" id="masterman.c0.p1261"><s>"To be sure; they're in the yam patch, very busy feeding on them, I'll be bound."</s> </p>

<p pid="1262" id="masterman.c0.p1262"><s>Ready gave a shout, and a grunting and rushing were heard among the broad leaves, and, very soon, out rushed, instead of the six, about thirty pigs large and small; who, snorting and twisting their tails, galloped away at a great rate, until they gained the cocoa-nut grove.</s> </p>

<p pid="1263" id="masterman.c0.p1263"><s>"How wild they are, Ready!" said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1264" id="masterman.c0.p1264"><s>"Yes, and they'll be wilder every day; but we must fence these yams from them, or we shall get none ourselves."</s> </p>

<p pid="1265" id="masterman.c0.p1265"><s>"But they'll beat down the fence before it grows up."</s> </p>

<p pid="1266" id="masterman.c0.p1266"><s>"We must pale it with cocoa-nut palings, and plant the prickly pears outside.</s> <s>Now, we'll go down to the sea-side."</s> </p>

<p pid="1267" id="masterman.c0.p1267" type="speech"><s>As they neared the rocks, which were bare for about fifty yards from the water's edge, Ready said, <qs/>"I can tell you now what those white patches on the rocks are, William; they are the places where the sea-birds come to every year to make their nests, and bring up their young.</s> <s>They always come to the same place every year, if they are not disturbed."<qe/></s> <s>They soon arrived at the spot, and found it white with the feathers of birds, mixed up with dirt.</s> </p>

<p pid="1268" id="masterman.c0.p1268"><s>"I see no nests, Ready, nor the remains of any."</s> </p>

<p pid="1269" id="masterman.c0.p1269"><s>"No, they do not make any nests, further than scratching a round hole, about half an inch deep, in the soil, and there they lay their eggs, sitting quite close to one another; they will soon be here, and begin to lay, and then we will come and take the eggs, if we want any, for they are not bad eating."</s> </p>

<p pid="1270" id="masterman.c0.p1270"><s>"Why, Ready, what a quantity of good things we have found out already!</s> <s>This has been a very fortunate expedition of ours."</s> </p>

<p pid="1271" id="masterman.c0.p1271"><s>"Yes, it has; and we may thank God for his goodness, who thus provides for us so plentifully in the wilderness."</s> </p>

<p pid="1272" id="masterman.c0.p1272"><s>"Do you know, Ready, I cannot help thinking that we ought to have built our house here."</s> </p>

<p pid="1273" id="masterman.c0.p1273"><s>"Not so, William; we have not the pure water, recollect, and we have not the advantages of the sandy beach, where we have our turtle- and fish-pond.</s> <s>No; we may feed our stock here; we may gather the fruit, taking our share of it with the poor birds; we may get our yams, and every other good provided for us; but our house and home must be where it is now."</s> </p>

<p pid="1274" id="masterman.c0.p1274"><s>"You are right, Ready; but it will be a long walk."</s> </p>

<p pid="1275" id="masterman.c0.p1275"><s>"Not when we are accustomed to it, and have made a beaten path; besides, we may bring the boat round, perhaps."</s> </p>

<p pid="1276" id="masterman.c0.p1276"><s>Then they walked along the sea-side for about a quarter of a mile, until they came to where the rocks were not so high, and there they discovered a little basin, completely formed in the rocks, with a narrow entrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="1277" id="masterman.c0.p1277"><s>"See, William, what a nice little harbour for our boat! we may here load it with yams and take it round to the bay, provided we can find an entrance through the reefs on the southern side of it, which we have not looked for yet, because we have not required it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1278" id="masterman.c0.p1278"><s>"Yes, Ready--it is, indeed, a nice, smooth little place for the boat.</s> <s>What is that thing on the bottom, there?" said William, pointing in the direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="1279" id="masterman.c0.p1279"><s>"That is a sea crawfish, quite as good eating as a lobster.</s> <s>I wonder if I could make a lobster-pot; we should catch plenty, and very good they are."</s> </p>

<p pid="1280" id="masterman.c0.p1280"><s>"And what are those little rough things on the rock?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1281" id="masterman.c0.p1281"><s>"They are a very nice little sort of oyster; not like those we have in England, but much better--they are so delicate."</s> </p>

<p pid="1282" id="masterman.c0.p1282" type="speech"><s>"Why, Ready, we have two more good things for our table, again," replied William; <qs/>"how rich we shall be!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1283" id="masterman.c0.p1283"><s>"Yes; but we have to catch them, recollect: there is nothing to be had in this world without labour."</s> </p>

<p pid="1284" id="masterman.c0.p1284" type="speech"><s>"Ready," said William, <qs/>"we have good three hours' daylight; suppose we go back and tell what we have seen: my mother will be so glad to see us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1285" id="masterman.c0.p1285"><s>"I agree with you, William.</s> <s>We have done well for one day; and may safely go back again, and remain for another week.</s> <s>There are no fruits at present, and all I care about are the yams; I should like to protect them from the pigs.</s> <s>But let us go home and talk the matter over with Mr Seagrave."</s> </p>

<p pid="1286" id="masterman.c0.p1286"><s>They found out the spot where they had left their knapsacks and hatchets, and again took their path through the cocoa-nut trees, following the blaze which they had made in the morning.</s> <s>One hour before sunset they arrived at the house, where they found Mr and Mrs Seagrave sitting outside, and Juno standing on the beach with the two children, who were amusing themselves with picking up the shells which were strewed about.</s> <s>William gave a very clear account of all they had seen, and showed his father the specimens of the plants which he had collected.</s> </p>

<p pid="1287" id="masterman.c0.p1287" type="speech"><s>"This," said Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"is a well-known plant; and I wonder Ready did not recognise it; it is hemp."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1288" id="masterman.c0.p1288"><s>"I never saw it except in the shape of rope," replied Ready.</s> <s>"I know the seed well enough."</s> </p>

<p pid="1290" id="masterman.c0.p1290"><s>"This odd-looking, rough thing."</s> </p>

<p pid="1291" id="masterman.c0.p1291"><s>"That's the egg-plant: it bears fruit of a blue colour.</s> <s>I am told they eat it in the hot countries."</s> </p>

<p pid="1292" id="masterman.c0.p1292"><s>"Yes, sir, they do; they fry it with pepper and salt; they call it bringal.</s> <s>I think it must be that."</s> </p>

<p pid="1293" id="masterman.c0.p1293"><s>"I do not doubt but you are right," replied Mr Seagrave.</s> <s>"Why, William, you should know this."</s> </p>

<p pid="1294" id="masterman.c0.p1294"><s>"It is like the grape-vine."</s> </p>

<p pid="1295" id="masterman.c0.p1295"><s>"Yes, and it is so; it is the wild grape; we shall eat them by and bye."</s> </p>

<p pid="1296" id="masterman.c0.p1296"><s>"I have only one more, papa: what is this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1297" id="masterman.c0.p1297"><s>"You don't know it, because it has sprung up so high, William; but it is the common mustard plant,--what we use in England, and is sold as mustard and cress.</s> <s>I think you have now made a famous day's work of it; and we have much to thank God for."</s> </p>

<p pid="1298" id="masterman.c0.p1298"><s>As soon as they had returned to the house, a consultation was held as to their future proceedings; and, after some debate, it was agreed that it would be advisable that they should take the boat out of the sand; and, as soon as it was ready, examine the reef on the southward, to see if they could find a passage through it, as it would take a long while to go round it; and, as soon as that was accomplished, Mr Seagrave, Ready, William, and Juno should all go through the wood, carrying with them a tent to pitch on the newly-discovered piece of ground: and that they should set up a flag-staff at the little harbour, to point out its position.</s> <s>Of course, that would be a hard day's work; but that they would, nevertheless, return the same night, and not leave Mrs Seagrave alone with the children.</s> <s>Having accomplished this, Ready and William would then put the wheels and axle in the boat, and other articles required, such as saw, hatchets, and spades, and row round to the south side of the island, to find the little harbour.</s> <s>As soon as they had landed them, and secured the boat, they would then return by the path through the wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="1299" id="masterman.c0.p1299"><s>The next job would be to rail in the yam plantation to keep off the pigs, and, at the same time, to drive the sheep and goats through the wood, that they might feed on the new pasture ground.</s> <s>Ready and William were then to cut down cocoa-nut trees sufficient for the paling, fix up the posts, and when that was done, Mr Seagrave was to come to them and assist them in railing it in, and drawing the timber.</s> <s>This they expected would be all done in about a month; and during that time, as Mrs Seagrave and Juno would be, for the greatest part of it, left at the house, they were to employ themselves in clearing the garden of weeds, and making preparation for fencing it in.</s> </p>

<p pid="1303" id="masterman.c0.p1303"><s>The old man's heart beat quick; he dropped his telescope on his arm, and fetched some heavy breaths before he could recover from the effect of this unexpected sight.</s> <s>After a minute, he again put his telescope to his eye, and then made her out to be a brig, under top-sails and top-gallant sails, steering directly for the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="1304" id="masterman.c0.p1304" type="speech"><s>Ready walked to the rocky point, from which they fished, and sat down to reflect.</s> <s>Could it be that the vessel had been sent after them, or that she had by mere chance come among the islands?</s> <s>He decided after a short time that it must be chance, for none could know that they were saved, much less that they were on the island.</s> <s>Her steering towards the island must then be either that she required water or something else; perhaps she would alter her course and pass by them.</s> <s>"At all events," thought the old man, <qs/>"we are in the hands of God, who will, at his own time and in his own way, do with us as he thinks fit.</s> <s>I will not at present say anything to Mr and Mrs Seagrave.</s> <s>It would be cruel to raise hopes which might end in disappointment.</s> <s>A few hours will decide.</s> <s>And yet I cannot do without help--I must trust William."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1305" id="masterman.c0.p1305"><s>Ready rose, examined the vessel with his telescope, and then walked towards the house.</s> <s>William was up, and the remainder of the family were stirring.</s> </p>

<p pid="1306" id="masterman.c0.p1306" type="speech"><s>"William," said Ready to him, as they walked away from the house, <qs/>"I have a secret to tell you, which you will at once see the necessity of not telling to anyone at present.</s> <s>A few hours will decide the question."<qe/></s> <s>William readily gave his promise.</s> <s>"There is a vessel off the island; she may be the means of rescuing us, or she may pass without seeing us.</s> <s>It would be too cruel a disappointment to your father and mother, if the latter were the case."</s> </p>

<p pid="1307" id="masterman.c0.p1307"><s>William stared at Ready, and for a moment could not speak, his excitement was so great.</s> </p>

<p pid="1308" id="masterman.c0.p1308"><s>"Oh, Ready, how grateful I am!</s> <s>I trust that we may be taken away, for you have no idea how my poor father suffers in silence--and so does my mother."</s> </p>

<p pid="1310" id="masterman.c0.p1310"><s>Ready caught the vessel in the field of the telescope, which he leant against the trunk of a cocoa-nut, and William put his eye to the glass.</s> </p>

<p pid="1322" id="masterman.c0.p1322" type="speech"><s>"It will be a very good thing, Ready," observed Mrs Seagrave; <qs/>"and, at the same time, Juno and I will give the house a thorough cleaning and sweeping."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1324" id="masterman.c0.p1324" type="speech"><s>"Yes," replied Ready; <qs/>"we had better air everything.</s> <s>We will assist in taking down the screens and flags, and spread them out to air, and then, if Mr Seagrave has no objection, we will leave him to superintend and assist Madam and Juno."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1325" id="masterman.c0.p1325"><s>"With all my heart," replied Mr Seagrave.</s> <s>"We have done breakfast, and will begin as soon as you please."</s> </p>

<p pid="1326" id="masterman.c0.p1326"><s>Ready and William took down the canvas screens and flags, and went out of the cottage with them; they spread out the canvas at some distance from the house, and then William went down to the beach with the flags, while Ready procured the block and small rope to hoist them up with.</s> </p>

<p pid="1328" id="masterman.c0.p1328" type="speech"><s>"The breeze is getting up strong, William," said Ready, <qs/>"and she will soon be down, if she is not frightened at the reefs, which she can see plainer now the water is rough, than she could before."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1348" id="masterman.c0.p1348"><s>"I am sorry to say, sir, that I do.</s> <s>It looks very threatening to the southward, and until the gale is over, they will not venture near an island so surrounded with rocks.</s> <s>It would be very imprudent if they did.</s> <s>However, sir, a few hours will decide."</s> </p>

<p pid="1349" id="masterman.c0.p1349" type="speech"><s>"But, surely," said Mrs Seagrave, <qs/>"even if it does blow, they will not leave the island without taking us off.</s> <s>They will come after the gale is over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1351" id="masterman.c0.p1351"><s>The brig had, in the meantime, kept away again, as if she was running in; but very soon afterwards she hauled to the wind, with her head to the northward, and stood away from the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="1376" id="masterman.c0.p1376" type="speech"><s>"Ready!</s> <s>Ready!" exclaimed William, pointing to the south-east part of the reef; <qs/>"what is that?</s> <s>Look! it's a boat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1379" id="masterman.c0.p1379"><s>They hastened along the beach to the spot nearest to where the canoe was tossing on the surf, and watched it as it approached the shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="1380" id="masterman.c0.p1380"><s>"William, this canoe must have been blown off from the large island, which lies out there;" and Ready again looked through his telescope:</s> <s>"there are two people in it, and they are islanders.</s> <s>Poor things! they struggle hard for their lives, and seem much exhausted; but they have passed through the most dangerous part of the reef."</s> </p>

<p pid="1381" id="masterman.c0.p1381" type="speech"><s>"Yes," replied William, <qs/>"they will soon be in smoother water; but the surf on the beach is very heavy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1382" id="masterman.c0.p1382"><s>"They won't mind that, if their strength don't fail them--they manage the canoe beautifully."</s> </p>

<p pid="1383" id="masterman.c0.p1383"><s>During this conversation the canoe had rapidly come towards the land.</s> <s>In a moment or two afterwards, it passed through the surf and grounded on the beach.</s> <s>The two people in it had just strength enough left to paddle through the surf, and then they dropped down in the bottom of the canoe, quite exhausted.</s> </p>

<p pid="1384" id="masterman.c0.p1384"><s>"Let's drag the canoe higher up, William.</s> <s>Poor creatures! they are nearly dead."</s> </p>

<p pid="1385" id="masterman.c0.p1385"><s>While dragging it up, Ready observed that the occupants were both women: their faces were tattooed all over; otherwise they were young, and might have been good-looking.</s> </p>

<p pid="1386" id="masterman.c0.p1386"><s>"Shall I run up and get something for them, Ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1387" id="masterman.c0.p1387"><s>"Do, William; ask Juno to give you some of whatever there is for breakfast; anything warm."</s> </p>

<p pid="1391" id="masterman.c0.p1391" type="speech"><s>"It is so," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"but to tell the truth, I am not over pleased at their arrival.</s> <s>It proves what we were not sure of before, that we have very near neighbours, who may probably pay us a very unwelcome visit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1392" id="masterman.c0.p1392" type="speech"><s>"That may be, sir," replied Ready; <qs/>"still these two poor creatures being thrown on shore here does not make the matter worse, or the danger greater.</s> <s>Perhaps it may turn to our advantage; for if these women learn to speak English before any other islanders visit us, they will interpret for us, and be the means, perhaps, of saving our lives."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1427" id="masterman.c0.p1427" type="speech"><s>"I am most willing, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, sitting down upon a rock; <qs/>"and as you are the oldest, and moreover the best adviser of the three, we will first hear what you have to propose."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1428" id="masterman.c0.p1428"><s>"Well then, Mr Seagrave, it appears to me that it will not do to remain in the house, for we may, as I have said, be surprised by the savages at any hour in the night, and we have no means of defence against numbers."</s> </p>

<p pid="1430" id="masterman.c0.p1430" type="speech"><s>"I should think not, sir," said Ready; <qs/>"what I propose is this: we have made a discovery on the south of the island, which is of great importance to us; not that I consider the fruit and other plants of any great value, as they will only serve to increase our luxuries, if I may so call them, during the summer season.</s> <s>One great advantage to us, is the feed which we have found for our live stock, and the fodder for them during the rainy season; but principally, the patch of yams, which will afford us food during the winter.</s> <s>They are of great importance to us, and we cannot too soon protect them from the pigs, which will certainly root them all up, if we do not prevent them.</s> <s>Now, sir, you know what we had arranged to do, but which we have not done; I think the cocoa-nut rails will take too much time, and it will be sufficient to make a ditch and hedge round the yams; but it will be very tedious if we are to go backwards and forwards to do the work, and Mrs Seagrave and the children will be left alone.</s> <s>I therefore propose, as the weather is now set in fair, and will remain so for months, that we pitch our tents on that part of the island, and remove the whole family there; we shall soon be very comfortable, and at all events much safer there than if we remain here, without any defence."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1431" id="masterman.c0.p1431"><s>"It is an excellent plan, Ready; we shall, as you say, be removed from danger for the time, and when there, we may consider what we had best do by and by."</s> </p>

<p pid="1432" id="masterman.c0.p1432"><s>"Yes, sir.</s> <s>Those women may not have gained the other island, it is true, for they had the wind right against them for several days after they went away in the canoe, and, moreover, the current sets strong this way; but if they have, we must expect that the savages will pay us a visit; they will, of course, come direct to the house, if they do come."</s> </p>

<p pid="1433" id="masterman.c0.p1433"><s>"But, Ready, you don't mean to say that we are to leave this side of the island altogether, and all our comfortable arrangements?" said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1434" id="masterman.c0.p1434"><s>"No, William, not altogether; for now I come to the second part of my proposition.</s> <s>As soon as we have done our work at the yam plantation, and made everything as comfortable there as we can, I think we may then leave Mrs Seagrave and the children in the tents, and work here.</s> <s>As we before agreed, let us abandon the house in which we live at present, and fit out the outhouse which is concealed in the cocoa-nut grove, as a dwelling-house, and fortify it so as to be secure against any sudden attack of the savages: for, return here we must, to live, as we cannot remain in the tents after the rainy season sets in."</s> </p>

<p pid="1435" id="masterman.c0.p1435" type="speech"><s>"How do you propose to fortify it, Ready?" said Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"I hardly know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1436" id="masterman.c0.p1436"><s>"That I will explain to you by and by, sir.</s> <s>Then, if the savages come here, at all events we should be able to defend ourselves with fire-arms; one man behind a stockade is better than twenty who have no other arms but spears and clubs; and we may, with the help of God, beat them off."</s> </p>

<p pid="1437" id="masterman.c0.p1437" type="speech"><s>"I think your plan is excellent, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"and that the sooner we begin, the better."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1439" id="masterman.c0.p1439"><s>"Let us not lose an hour, Ready; we have lost too much time already," replied Mr Seagrave.</s> <s>"What shall we do to-day?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1521" id="masterman.c0.p1521" type="speech"><s>"Very true, Ready," said Mr Seagrave, rising up; <qs/>"it is not only useless, but even sinful to indulge in them, as they only can lead to our repining at the decrees of heaven.</s> <s>Let us now examine the rocks, and see if anything has been thrown up that may be of use to us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1522" id="masterman.c0.p1522"><s>They walked round, but, with the exception of spars and a barrel or two of tar, they could find nothing of value.</s> <s>There was no want of staves and iron hoops of broken casks, and these, Ready observed, would make excellent palings for the garden when they had time to bring them round.</s> </p>

<p pid="1523" id="masterman.c0.p1523"><s>After they had returned, they sat down to rest themselves, and then they went to the tents in the cocoa-nut grove, in which they had collected the articles thrown up when the ship went to pieces.</s> </p>

<p pid="1533" id="masterman.c0.p1533"><s>"I trust we shall never want to drink a drop of it, sir, either as a medicine or otherwise.</s> <s>Now for this cask with wooden hoops."</s> </p>

<p pid="1539" id="masterman.c0.p1539"><s>When the box was opened, everything appeared in a sad mouldy state from the salt water which had penetrated; but on removing the brown paper and pasteboard, it was found to contain stationery of all sorts, and, except on the outside, it was very little injured.</s> </p>

<p pid="1540" id="masterman.c0.p1540"><s>"This is indeed a treasure, Ready.</s> <s>I recollect now; this is paper, pens, and everything requisite for writing, besides children's books, copy-books, paint-boxes, and a great many other articles in the stationery line."</s> </p>

<p pid="1654" id="masterman.c0.p1654"><s>"In what points does man show that he is led by instinct?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1655" id="masterman.c0.p1655"><s>"When a child is first born, William, it acts by instinct only: the reasoning powers are not yet developed; as we grow up, our reason becomes every day more matured, and gains the mastery over our instinct, which decreases in proportion."</s> </p>

<p pid="1657" id="masterman.c0.p1657"><s>"Not so, my dear boy; there is one and a most powerful instinct implanted in man which never deserts him on this side of the grave.</s> <s>It is the fear, not of death, but of utter annihilation, that of becoming nothing after death.</s> <s>This instinctive feeling could not have been so deeply implanted in us, but as an assurance that we shall not be annihilated after death, but that our souls shall still exist, although our bodies shall have perished.</s> <s>It may be termed the instinctive evidence of a future existence."</s> </p>

<p pid="1658" id="masterman.c0.p1658"><s>"That is very true, Mr Seagrave," observed Ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="1659" id="masterman.c0.p1659" type="speech"><s>"Instinct in animals, William," continued Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"is a feeling which compels them to perform certain acts without previous thought or reflection; this instinct is in full force at the moment of their birth; it was therefore perfect in the beginning, and has never varied.</s> <s>The swallow built her nest, the spider its web, the bee formed its comb, precisely in the same way four thousand years ago, as they do now.</s> <s>I may here observe, that one of the greatest wonders of instinct is the mathematical form of the honeycomb of the bee, which has been proved by demonstration to be that by which is given the greatest possible saving of time and labour."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1664" id="masterman.c0.p1664"><s>In the evening, William requested his father to renew the conversation about the reasoning powers of animals.</s> </p>

<p pid="1665" id="masterman.c0.p1665" type="speech"><s>"With pleasure, William," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"it is a fit discourse for a Sunday evening.</s> <s>Let us, however, first examine the various mental faculties discoverable in animals.</s> <s>In the first place, they have memory, especially memory of persons and places, quite as tenacious as our own.</s> <s>A dog will recognise an old master after many years absence.</s> <s>An elephant, who had again escaped into the woods, after twenty years remaining in a wild state, recognised his old mahoot, or driver.</s> <s>A dog will find his way back when taken more than a hundred miles from his master's residence.</s> <s>Another proof of memory in animals, were it required, is that they dream.</s> <s>Now, a dream is a confused recollection of past events; and how often do you not hear Romulus and Remus growling, barking, and whining in their sleep!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1666" id="masterman.c0.p1666"><s>"Very true, papa."</s> </p>

<p pid="1667" id="masterman.c0.p1667"><s>"Well, then, they have attention.</s> <s>See how patiently a cat will remain for hours before a hole, in watch for the mouse to come out.</s> <s>A spider will remain for months watching for the fly to enter its web; but this quality is to be observed in every animal in the pursuit of its prey.</s> <s>They have also association of ideas, which is, in fact, reasoning.</s> <s>A dog proves that; he will allow a gentleman to come up to the door, but fly at a beggar.</s> <s>When he is in charge of any property he will take no notice of a passer-by; but if a man stops, he barks immediately.</s> <s>In the elephant this association of ideas is even more remarkable; indeed, he understands what is said to him better than any other animal; his reasoning powers are most extraordinary.</s> <s>Promise him rewards, and he will make wonderful exertion.</s> <s>He is also extremely alive to a sense of shame.</s> <s>The elephants were employed to transport the heavy artillery in India.</s> <s>One of the finest attempted in vain to force a gun through a swamp.</s> <s>`Take away that lazy beast,' said the director `and bring another.'</s> <s>The animal was so stung with the reproach, that it used so much exertion to force the gun on with its head, as to fracture its skull, and it fell dead.</s> <s>When Chunee, the elephant which was so long in Exeter Change, was ordered as usual to take up a sixpence with his trunk, it happened one day that the sixpence rolled against the skirting-board, out of his reach.</s> <s>Chunee stopped, and reflected a little while, and then, drawing the air into his trunk, he threw it out with all his force against the skirting-board; the rebound of the air from the skirting-board blew the sixpence towards him, and he was enabled to reach it."</s> </p>

<p pid="1668" id="masterman.c0.p1668"><s>"That was very clever of him," replied William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1669" id="masterman.c0.p1669"><s>"Yes; it was a proof of thought, with a knowledge of cause and effect.</s> <s>There was a curious instance of a horse, which, by the bye, I consider the most noble animal of creation, which was ridden round by his master, to deliver newspapers.</s> <s>He invariably stopped at the doors where papers were to be left; but it happened that two people, living at different houses, took in a weekly newspaper between them; and it was agreed, that one should have the first reading of it on one week, and the other on the following.</s> <s>After a short time the horse became accustomed to this arrangement, and stopped at the one house on the one week, and at the other house on the following, never making a mistake."</s> </p>

<p pid="1670" id="masterman.c0.p1670"><s>"That was very curious; what a sagacious animal he must have been!" observed William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1671" id="masterman.c0.p1671"><s>"Animals also are, as you know, capable of receiving instruction, which is another proof of reasoning powers.</s> <s>The elephant, the horse, the dog, the pig, even birds may be taught a great deal."</s> </p>

<p pid="1672" id="masterman.c0.p1672"><s>"But then, papa, I still wish to know where the line is to be drawn between reason and instinct."</s> </p>

<p pid="1673" id="masterman.c0.p1673"><s>"I was about to come to that very point, William.</s> <s>When animals follow their instinct in providing their food, bringing up their young, and in their precautions against danger, they follow certain fixed rules, from which they never deviate.</s> <s>But circumstances may occur against which their instinct can afford them no regular provision; then it is that their reasoning powers are called into action.</s> <s>I will explain this by stating a fact relative to the bee, one of the animals upon which instinct is most powerful in its action.</s> <s>There is a certain large moth, called the Death's-head moth, which is very fond of honey.</s> <s>It sometimes contrives to force its way through the aperture of the hive, and gain an entrance.</s> <s>The bees immediately attack it, and it is soon destroyed by their stings; but the carcass is so large, that they cannot carry it out of the hive, as they invariably do the bodies of the smaller insects which may have intruded, and it appears that their sense of smell is very acute.</s> <s>What, then, do they do to avoid the stench arising from the dead body of this large moth?</s> <s>Why, they embalm it, covering it entirely with wax, by which it no longer becomes offensive to them."</s> </p>

<p pid="1674" id="masterman.c0.p1674"><s>"But, papa, might not their instinct have provided for such an event?" observed William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1675" id="masterman.c0.p1675"><s>"If such an event could have occurred to the bees in their wild state, you certainly might have raised the question; but recollect, William, that bees in their wild state live in the hollows of trees, and that the hole by which they enter is never more than sufficiently large to admit one bee at a time; consequently, no animal larger than a bee could gain entrance, and if it did, could of course have been easily removed from the hive; but the bees were here in a new position, in an artificial state, in a hive of straw with a large aperture, and therefore met with an exigence they were not prepared for, and acted accordingly."</s> </p>

<p pid="1676" id="masterman.c0.p1676"><s>"Yes, papa, I perceive the difference."</s> </p>

<p pid="1707" id="masterman.c0.p1707"><s>The next day being Sunday was a day of repose, and as they had all worked so hard, they felt the luxury of a day of rest.</s> <s>In the afternoon, they agreed that on Monday they should make every preparation for quitting the tents, and returning to the house at the bay.</s> <s>They decided that the live stock should all be left there, as the pasturage was so plentiful and good, with the exception of one goat, which they would take back with them, to supply them with milk; and they also agreed that the tents should be left standing, with some cooking utensils, that in case William and Ready went round for the bananas or yams, or to examine the live stock, they should not be compelled to sleep in the open air, and should have the means of dressing their dinner.</s> <s>William and Ready were to carry the beds, etcetera, round to the bay in the boat, which they could do in two trips, and Mr and Mrs Seagrave, with the family, were to walk through the woods after taking a very early breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="1709" id="masterman.c0.p1709"><s>"Papa, they always say `as stupid as an ass.'</s> <s>Is an ass such a stupid animal?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1710" id="masterman.c0.p1710"><s>"No, William; it is a very sagacious one; but the character has been given to the animal more on account of its obstinacy and untractableness, than on any other account.</s> <s>It is usual to say, as stupid as an ass, or as stupid as a pig, or a goose.</s> <s>Now, these three animals are very much maligned, for they are all sagacious animals.</s> <s>But the fact is that, as regards the ass, we have only very sorry specimens of the animal in England; they are stunted and small, and, from want of corn and proper food, besides being very ill-treated, are slow and dull-looking animals.</s> <s>The climate of England is much too cold for the ass; in the south of France and the Mediterranean, where it is much warmer, the ass is a much finer animal; but to see it in perfection we must go to the Torrid Zone in Guinea, right on the equator, the hottest portion of the globe, where the ass, in its native state and in its native country, is a handsome creature and as fleet as the wind; indeed, supposed to be, and mentioned in the Scriptures as the fleetest animal in creation.</s> <s>The fact is, that in Asia, especially in Palestine and Syria, asses were in great repute, and used in preference to horses.</s> <s>We must see an animal in its own climate to form a true estimate of its value."</s> </p>

<p pid="1711" id="masterman.c0.p1711"><s>"Does climate, then, make so great a difference?" said William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1712" id="masterman.c0.p1712"><s>"Of course it does, not only with animals, but with trees, plants, and even man, until he is accustomed to the change.</s> <s>With respect to animals, there are some which can bear the different varieties of climate, and even change of food.</s> <s>The horse, for instance, although originally indigenous to Arabia, lives as well in the Temperate, and even in the Frigid Zones it may be said, for they endure the hard winters of Russia and North America; so will domestic cattle, such as cows, sheep, pigs, etcetera.</s> <s>It is a curious fact that, during the winter in Canada, a large proportion of the food of cattle consists of _fish_."</s> </p>

<p pid="1713" id="masterman.c0.p1713"><s>"Fish, papa!</s> <s>Cows eat fish?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1714" id="masterman.c0.p1714"><s>"Yes, my dear boy, such is the fact.</s> <s>It is a remarkable instance of a graminivorous or grass-eating animal being changed for a time into a flesh-eating, or rather into fish-eating animal.</s> <s>But there are other animals which can live under any temperature, as the wolf, the fox, the hare, and rabbit.</s> <s>It is a curious provision,--that the sheep and goats in the hottest climates throw off their warm covering of wool, and retain little better than hair; while, removed to a cold climate, they recover their warm covering immediately."</s> </p>

<p pid="1715" id="masterman.c0.p1715"><s>"But a goat has no wool, papa."</s> </p>

<p pid="1716" id="masterman.c0.p1716"><s>"What are Cashmere shawls made of, William?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1717" id="masterman.c0.p1717"><s>"Very true, papa."</s> </p>

<p pid="1718" id="masterman.c0.p1718"><s>"Most animals have a certain increase of covering as they recede further from the warm climates to the cold ones.</s> <s>Wolves and foxes, hares and rabbits, change the colour of their skins to white when they get far north.</s> <s>The little English stoat, which is destroyed by the gamekeepers, becomes the beautiful snow-white ermine in Russia and other cold countries."</s> </p>

<p pid="1719" id="masterman.c0.p1719"><s>"Well, papa, I think it a great advantage to man, and a proof of the Almighty's care of him and kindness to him, in permitting all the animals most useful to him to be able to live in any country; but I don't know whether I am wrong in saying so, papa:</s> <s>I cannot see why an animal like the wolf should not have been kept to his own climate, like the lion and tiger, and other ferocious animals."</s> </p>

<p pid="1720" id="masterman.c0.p1720"><s>"You have started a question, William, which I am glad you have done, rather than it should have remained on your mind, and have puzzled you.</s> <s>It is true that the shepherd might agree with you, that the wolf is a nuisance; equally true that the husbandman may exclaim, What is the good of thistles, and the various weeds which choke the soil?</s> <s>But, my dear boy, if they are not, which I think they are, for the benefit of man, at all events they are his doom for the first transgression.</s> <s>`Cursed is the ground for thy sake--thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee--and by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,' was the Almighty's sentence; and it is only by labour that the husbandman can obtain his crops, and by watchfulness that the shepherd can guard his flocks.</s> <s>Labour is in itself a benefit: without exercise there would be no health, and without health there would be no enjoyment."</s> </p>

<p pid="1721" id="masterman.c0.p1721"><s>"I see now, papa.</s> <s>You have mentioned the animals which can live in all climates; will you not tell us something about other animals?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1722" id="masterman.c0.p1722"><s>"There is but one remark to make, William, which is, that animals indigenous to, that is, originally to be found in, any one portion of the globe, invariably are so fashioned as to be most fit for that country, and have the food also most proper for them growing or to be obtained in that country.</s> <s>Take, for instance, the camel, an animal fashioned expressly for the country to which he is indigenous, and without whose aid all communication must have been stopped between Asia and Africa.</s> <s>He is called the `Ship of the Desert;' for the desert is a `sea of sand.'</s> <s>His feet are so fashioned that he can traverse the sands with facility; he can live upon the coarsest vegetable food and salt plants which are found there, and he has the capacity of carrying water in a sort of secondary stomach, for his own supply where no water is to be found.</s> <s>Here is an animal wonderfully made by the Almighty for an express locality, and for the convenience of man in that country; for, in England, or elsewhere, he would be of no value.</s> <s>But it is late, my dear William; so we will first thank Him for all his mercies, and then to bed."</s> </p>

<p pid="1725" id="masterman.c0.p1725"><s>At last, Ready, to get rid of him, sent him down with a large bundle to the beach.</s> <s>Tommy shouldered it with great importance, but when he came back, looking rather warm with the exertion, and Ready asked him to take down another, he said he was too tired, and sat down very quietly till breakfast-time, before which everything was ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="1726" id="masterman.c0.p1726"><s>Mrs Seagrave and Juno packed up the breakfast and dinner things in a basket after breakfast was over, and then Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the family set off on their journey, accompanied by the dogs, through the cocoa-nut grove.</s> </p>

<p pid="1727" id="masterman.c0.p1727"><s>William and Ready lost no time in getting through their work; the crockery, kitchen utensils, table, and chairs, were the first articles put into the boat.</s> <s>The goat was then led down, and they set off with a full load, and arrived at the bay long before the party who were walking through the wood.</s> <s>They landed the things on the beach, and then shoved off again to bring round the bedding, which was all that was left.</s> <s>By three o'clock in the afternoon they had arrived at the bay with their second and last load, and found that the other party had been there about an hour, and Mr Seagrave and Juno were very busy taking the articles up from the beach.</s> </p>

<p pid="1728" id="masterman.c0.p1728" type="speech"><s>"Well, William," said Ready, <qs/>"this is our last trip for some time, I expect; and so much the better, for our little boat must have something done to her as soon as I can find time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1730" id="masterman.c0.p1730"><s>"If it pleases God that we live and do well," replied Ready, who had his eyes fixed upon the sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="1732" id="masterman.c0.p1732"><s>After a little consultation with Mr Seagrave, Ready marked out a square of cocoa-nut trees surrounding the storehouse, so as to leave a space within them of about twenty yards each side, which they considered large enough for the inclosure.</s> <s>These cocoa-nut trees were to serve as the posts between which were to be fixed other cocoa-nut trees cut down, and about fourteen feet high, so as to form a palisade or stockade, which could not be climbed over, and would protect them from any attack of the savages.</s> </p>

<p pid="1733" id="masterman.c0.p1733"><s>As soon as the line of trees had been marked out, they set to work cutting down all the trees within the line, and then outside to a distance of ten yards, so as to give them room for their work.</s> <s>Ready cut out cross-pieces, to nail from tree to tree, and now they found the advantage of having saved so many of the large spike nails, without which they never could have made so good or so quick a job of it.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave cut down trees, William and Juno sawed them off at a proper length with one of the cross-cut saws, and then carried them to Ready.</s> <s>They soon had more cut out than he could use, and then they dragged away the tops and branches, and piled them at a distance on the ground, to use as winter fuel, while Mr Seagrave helped Ready in fixing up the palisades.</s> <s>They worked very hard that day, and were not sorry to go to bed.</s> <s>Ready, however, took an opportunity to speak to William.</s> </p>

<p pid="1761" id="masterman.c0.p1761" type="speech"><s>"He has been punished enough, as far as fright goes," replied William; <qs/>"I'll answer for it, he'll never get into the boat again by himself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1763" id="masterman.c0.p1763"><s>"No, Ready; I never could have managed her so skilfully as you did, and therefore I must have been swamped before I got on shore."</s> </p>

<p pid="1769" id="masterman.c0.p1769"><s>When Tommy was questioned on the following morning as to his inducement to get into the boat, to their great surprise he replied, that he wanted to go round to the tents again, to see if the bananas were ripe; that he intended to eat some of them and be back before dinner-time, that he might not be found out.</s> </p>

<p pid="1770" id="masterman.c0.p1770"><s>"I suspect, Tommy, you would have been very hungry before you ate any bananas if we had not perceived you," said Ready.</s> </p>

<p pid="1773" id="masterman.c0.p1773"><s>The stockade was now almost finished; the door was the occasion of a good deal of consultation; at last, it was agreed that it would be better to have a door of stout oak plank, but with second door-posts inside, about a foot apart from the door, between which could be inserted short poles one above the other, so as to barricade it within when required.</s> <s>This would make the door as strong as any other portion of the stockade.</s> <s>As soon as this was all complete, the storehouse was to be altered for a dwelling-house, by taking away the wattles of cocoa-nut boughs on the sides, and filling them up with logs of cocoa-nut trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="1774" id="masterman.c0.p1774"><s>Before the week was ended the stockade and door were complete, and they now began to fell trees, to form the sides of the house.</s> <s>This was rapid work; and while Mr Seagrave, William, and Juno felled the trees, and brought them on the wheels to the side of the stockade, all ready cut to their proper lengths, Ready was employed in flooring the house with a part of the deal planks which they had brought round from the cove.</s> <s>But this week they were obliged to break off for two days, to collect all their crops from the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="1775" id="masterman.c0.p1775"><s>A fortnight more passed away in continual hard work, but the house was at last finished, and very complete, compared to the one they were residing in.</s> <s>It was much larger, and divided into three rooms by the deal planking: the middle room which the door opened into was the sitting and eating room, with a window behind; the two side rooms were sleeping-rooms, one for Mrs Seagrave and the children, and the other for the male portion of the family.</s> </p>

<p pid="1776" id="masterman.c0.p1776" type="speech"><s>"See, William," said Ready, when they were alone, <qs/>"what we have been able to do by means of those deal planks; why, to have floored this house, and run up the partitions, would have taken us half a year if we had had to saw the wood."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1777" id="masterman.c0.p1777"><s>"Yes; and what a comfort it is to have so many shelves about.</s> <s>When shall we shift into this house?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1780" id="masterman.c0.p1780"><s>"We had better put some of our stores of least value in it for the present, until we can fit up another storehouse inside the stockade."</s> </p>

<p pid="1787" id="masterman.c0.p1787"><s>"I understand, Ready; how thoughtful you are!"</s> </p>

<p pid="1788" id="masterman.c0.p1788"><s>"If at my age I did not think a little, William, it would be very odd.</s> <s>You don't know how anxious I am to see them all inside of this defence."</s> </p>

<p pid="1790" id="masterman.c0.p1790"><s>"Why, sir, as there is still plenty of work, I do not like to press the matter, lest your mamma should be fidgeted, and think there was danger; but danger there is; I have a kind of forewarning of it.</s> <s>I wish you would propose that they should come in at once; the standing-bed places are all ready, except the canvas, and I shall nail on new by to-night."</s> </p>

<p pid="1791" id="masterman.c0.p1791"><s>In consequence of this conversation, William proposed at dinnertime that the next day they should go into the new house, as it was so much more handy to work there and live there at the same time.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave was of the same opinion, but Mrs Seagrave thought it better that everything should be tidy first.</s> </p>

<p pid="1792" id="masterman.c0.p1792" type="speech"><s>"Why, ma'am," said Ready, <qs/>"the only way to get things tidy is to go yourself and make them so.</s> <s>Nothing will ever be in its place unless you are there to put it in."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1793" id="masterman.c0.p1793" type="speech"><s>"Well, Ready," said Mrs Seagrave, <qs/>"since you are against me as well as all the rest, I give it up, and if you please we will shift over to-morrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1795" id="masterman.c0.p1795"><s>"Be it so, Ready; you are the best judge; to-morrow we will take up our quarters in the stockade."</s> </p>

<p pid="1796" id="masterman.c0.p1796"><s>"Thank God!" muttered Ready very softly.</s> </p>

<p pid="1797" id="masterman.c0.p1797"><s>The next day was fully employed in changing their residence, and shifting over the bedding and utensils; and that night they slept within the stockade.</s> <s>Ready had run up a very neat little outhouse of plank, as a kitchen for Juno, and another week was fully employed as follows: the stores were divided; those of least consequence, and the salt provisions, flour, and the garden produce, etcetera, were put into the old house; the casks of powder and most of the cartridges were also put there for security; but a cask of beef, of pork, and flour, all the iron-work and nails, canvas, etcetera, were stowed away for the present under the new house, which had, when built as a storehouse, been raised four feet from the ground to make a shelter for the stock.</s> <s>This was very spacious, and, of course, quite dry, and contained all they wished to put in.</s> <s>Ready also took care, by degrees, to fill the large water-butt full of water, and had fixed into the bottom a spigot for drawing the water off.</s> </p>

<p pid="1798" id="masterman.c0.p1798" type="speech"><s>"Well, Mr Seagrave," said Ready on the Saturday, <qs/>"we have done a good many hard weeks' work lately, but this is the last of them.</s> <s>We are now comfortably settled in our new house: our stores are all under cover, and safe from the weather, and so we may now take things a little easier.</s> <s>William and I must repair the boat, so that we may take a trip round to examine how the stock and yams get on."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1799" id="masterman.c0.p1799"><s>"And the bananas and the guavas," said Tommy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1800" id="masterman.c0.p1800"><s>"Why, we have quite forgotten all about them," observed Mrs Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="1801" id="masterman.c0.p1801"><s>"Yes, ma'am; we have been so busy, that it is no wonder; however, there may be some left yet, and I will go round as soon as the boat is able to swim, and bring all I can find."</s> </p>

<p pid="1803" id="masterman.c0.p1803"><s>"It will be better, sir, if we can find time, as we shall not have much more fine weather now; at all events, we can get them in at intervals when the weather is fine.</s> <s>Now I shall go my rounds for turtle.</s> <s>Good-night, ma'am,--good-night, sir.</s> <s>Come, William."</s> </p>

<p pid="1804" id="masterman.c0.p1804"><s>William and Ready succeeded in turning six more turtles to add to their stock, and having taken a careful survey with the telescope, they came back, fastened the door of the stockade, and went to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="1806" id="masterman.c0.p1806"><s>Another week passed away, during which Ready repaired the boat, and William and Mr Seagrave were employed in digging up the garden.</s> <s>It was also a very busy week at the house, as they had not washed linen for some time.</s> <s>Mrs Seagrave and Juno, and even little Caroline were hard at work, and Tommy was more useful than ever he had been, going for the water as they required it, and watching little Albert.</s> <s>Indeed, he was so active, that Mrs Seagrave praised him before his papa, and Tommy was quite proud.</s> </p>

<p pid="1807" id="masterman.c0.p1807"><s>On the Monday William and Ready set off in the boat to the little harbour, and found all the stock doing well.</s> <s>Many of the bananas and guavas had ripened and withered, but there were enough left to fill the boat half full.</s> </p>

<p pid="1808" id="masterman.c0.p1808"><s>"We cannot do better than to leave the stock where it is at present, William; they can run into the cocoa-nut grove for shelter if there is a storm, and there is feed enough for ten times as many."</s> </p>

<p pid="1809" id="masterman.c0.p1809"><s>"Yes; but will you not dig up a few yams first?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1810" id="masterman.c0.p1810"><s>"I had quite forgotten it, William.</s> <s>I will go for the spade."</s> </p>

<p pid="1811" id="masterman.c0.p1811"><s>Having procured the yams, they set off on their return.</s> <s>Before they arrived at the bay, the sky clouded over and threatened a storm.</s> <s>It did not, however, rain till after they had landed, when a small shower announced the commencement of the rainy season.</s> <s>The fruit was very welcome to all of them, it was so long since they had tasted any.</s> </p>

<p pid="1812" id="masterman.c0.p1812"><s>The following day was beautifully fine, and everything appeared refreshed by the rain which had fallen.</s> <s>It was, however, agreed, that Ready and William should go round the next morning, bring home the tents, and as many yams as the boat could carry.</s> <s>William and Ready went out at night as usual, when Ready observed that the wind had chopped round to the eastward.</s> </p>

<p pid="1813" id="masterman.c0.p1813"><s>"That will be bad for us to-morrow, Ready," replied William.</s> <s>"We may sail to the harbour, but we shall have to pull back with the loaded boat."</s> </p>

<p pid="1817" id="masterman.c0.p1817"><s>The next morning, just before the day dawned, Ready and William unfastened the door of the stockade, and went down to the beach.</s> <s>The wind was still to the eastward, and blowing rather fresh, and the sky was cloudy.</s> <s>As the sun rose, Ready, as usual, had his telescope with him, and looked through it at the offing to the eastward.</s> <s>As he kept the spy-glass to his eye for some time without speaking, William said:</s> </p>

<p pid="1821" id="masterman.c0.p1821"><s>"Yes, William, I am right.</s> <s>I thought that those dark patches I saw there were brown grass sails."</s> </p>

<p pid="1822" id="masterman.c0.p1822"><s>"Sails of what, Ready?" said William, hastily.</s> </p>

<p pid="1823" id="masterman.c0.p1823"><s>"Of the Indian canoes; I knew that they would come.</s> <s>Take the glass and look yourself; my eye is quite dim from straining it so long."</s> </p>

<p pid="1824" id="masterman.c0.p1824"><s>"Yes, I have them now," replied William, with his eye to the glass.</s> <s>At last he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="1827" id="masterman.c0.p1827"><s>"What must we do, Ready?</s> <s>How frightened my poor mother will be!</s> <s>I'm afraid we can do nothing against such a number."</s> </p>

<p pid="1828" id="masterman.c0.p1828"><s>"Yes, William, we can do a great deal, and we must do a great deal.</s> <s>That there are hundreds of savages there is no doubt; but recollect that we have a stockade, which they cannot easily climb over, and plenty of firearms and ammunition, so that we can make a good fight of it, and perhaps beat them off, for they have nothing but clubs and spears."</s> </p>

<p pid="1829" id="masterman.c0.p1829"><s>"How fast they come down, Ready; why, they will be here in an hour."</s> </p>

<p pid="1830" id="masterman.c0.p1830"><s>"No, sir, nor in two hours either; those are very large canoes.</s> <s>However, there is no time to be lost.</s> <s>While I watch them for a few minutes till I make them more clearly out, do you run up to the house and beckon your father to come down to me; and then, William, get all the muskets ready, and bring the casks of powder, and of made-up cartridges, from the old house into the stockade.</s> <s>Call Juno, and she will help you.</s> <s>We shall have time enough to do everything.</s> <s>After you have done that, you had better come down and join us."</s> </p>

<p pid="1831" id="masterman.c0.p1831"><s>In a very few minutes after William ran up to the house, Mr Seagrave made his appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="1833" id="masterman.c0.p1833"><s>"It is, Mr Seagrave, that the savages are now coming down upon us in large force; perhaps five or six hundred of them; and that we shall have to defend ourselves with might and main."</s> </p>

<p pid="1834" id="masterman.c0.p1834"><s>"Do you think we have any chance against such a force?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1835" id="masterman.c0.p1835"><s>"Yes, sir, with God's help I have no doubt but that we shall beat them off; but we must fight hard, and for some days, I fear."</s> </p>

<p pid="1836" id="masterman.c0.p1836"><s>Mr Seagrave examined the fleet of canoes with the glass.</s> <s>"It is, indeed, dreadful odds to contend against."</s> </p>

<p pid="1837" id="masterman.c0.p1837"><s>"Yes, sir, but three muskets behind a stockade are almost a match for all their clubs and spears, provided none of us are wounded."</s> </p>

<p pid="1838" id="masterman.c0.p1838"><s>"Well, Ready, we must put our trust in the Lord, and do our best; I will second you to the utmost of my power, and William, I'm sure, will do his duty."</s> </p>

<p pid="1839" id="masterman.c0.p1839" type="speech"><s>"I think, sir," said Ready, <qs/>"we had better not wait here any more, as we have not long to prepare for them.</s> <s>We have only to fix up some of our strong deal planks on the inside of the stockade for us to stand upon when we are attacked, that we may see what the enemy is about, and be able to fire upon them.</s> <s>But first we had better go to the old house, and take out what provisions and other articles we shall most want, and roll the casks into the stockade, for to the old house they will go first, and perhaps destroy everything in it.</s> <s>The casks they certainly will, for the sake of the iron hoops.</s> <s>An hour's work will do a great deal.</s> <s>I believe we have everything we want in the stockade; Juno has her fuel, the large butt of water will last us two or three weeks at least, and if we have time, we will get the wheels down, and spear a couple of turtles for fresh provisions."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1840" id="masterman.c0.p1840"><s>These observations were made as they walked up to the house.</s> <s>As soon as they arrived, they found William and Juno had just brought in the powder and cartridges.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave went in to break the matter to his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="1908" id="masterman.c0.p1908" type="speech"><s>"The idea is very good, Ready," said Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"if it had not been for this unfortunate want of water, I really should be sanguine of beating them off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1912" id="masterman.c0.p1912"><s>As Ready had supposed, no further attack was made by the savages on that day, and he, William, and Mr Seagrave, were very busy making their arrangements; they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above the stockade, so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five feet higher, and almost impossible to climb up; and they prepared a large fire in a tar-barrel full of cocoa-nut leaves mixed with wood and tar, so as to burn fiercely.</s> <s>Dinner or supper they had none, for there was nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle, and, by Ready's advice, they did not eat, as it would only increase their desire to drink.</s> </p>

<p pid="1913" id="masterman.c0.p1913" type="speech"><s>The poor children suffered much; and little Albert wailed and cried for <qs/>"water, water."<qe/></s> <s>Ready remained on the look-out; indeed, everything was so miserable inside of the house, that they were all glad to go out of it; they could do no good, and poor Mrs Seagrave had a difficult and most painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe privation, for the weather was still very warm and sultry.</s> </p>

<p pid="1917" id="masterman.c0.p1917"><s>When the fire burnt brightly, the savages outside were more easily aimed at, and a great many fell in their attempts to get over.</s> <s>The attack continued more than an hour, when at last, satisfied that they could not succeed, the savages once more withdrew, carrying with them, as before, their dead and wounded.</s> </p>

<p pid="1918" id="masterman.c0.p1918"><s>"I trust that they will now re-embark, and leave the island," said Mr Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="1919" id="masterman.c0.p1919" type="speech"><s>"I only wish they may, sir; it is not at all impossible; but there is no saying.</s> <s>I have been thinking, Mr Seagrave, that we might be able to ascertain their movements by making a look-out.</s> <s>You see, sir, that cocoa-nut tree," continued Ready, pointing to one of those to which the palisades were fastened, <qs/>"is much taller than any of the others: now, by driving spike-nails into the trunk at about a foot apart, we might ascend it with ease, and it would command a view of the whole bay; we then could know what the enemy were about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1920" id="masterman.c0.p1920"><s>"Yes, that is very true; but will not anyone be very much exposed if he climbs up?"</s> </p>

<p pid="1921" id="masterman.c0.p1921"><s>"No, sir; for you see the cocoa-nut trees are cut down clear of the palisades to such a distance, that no savage could come at all near without being seen by anyone on the look-out, and giving us sufficient time to get down again before he could use his spear."</s> </p>

<p pid="1922" id="masterman.c0.p1922"><s>"I believe that you are right there, Ready; but at all events I would not attempt to do it before daylight, as there may be some of them still lurking underneath the stockade."</s> </p>

<p pid="2030" id="masterman.c0.p2030"><s>When Captain Osborn was put into the boat by Mackintosh and the seamen of the _Pacific_, he was still insensible; but he gradually recovered, and after a stormy night, Captain Osborn was so far recovered as to hear from Mackintosh what had taken place, and why it was that he found himself in an open boat at sea.</s> <s>The next morning the wind moderated, and they were fortunate enough to fall in with a vessel bound to Van Diemen's Land, which took them all on board.</s> </p>

<p pid="2031" id="masterman.c0.p2031"><s>From the account given by Mackintosh, Captain Osborn had no doubt in his mind but that the Seagrave family had perished, and the loss of the vessel, with them on board, was duly reported to the owners.</s> <s>When at Van Diemen's Land, Captain Osborn was so much taken with the beauty and fertility of the country, and perhaps not so well inclined to go to sea again after such danger as he had incurred in the last voyage, that he resolved to purchase land and settle there.</s> <s>He did so, and had already stocked his farm with cattle, and had gone round to Sydney in a schooner to await the arrival of a large order from England which he had sent for, when the brig arrived and reported the existence of some white people on the small island, and also that they had hoisted a flag with the name _Pacific_ worked on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2032" id="masterman.c0.p2032"><s>Captain Osborn, hearing this, went to the master of the brig, and questioned him.</s> <s>He found the latitude and longitude of the island to be not far from that of the ship when she was deserted, and he was now convinced that, by some miracle, the Seagrave family had been preserved.</s> <s>He therefore went to the Governor of New South Wales, and made him acquainted with the facts which had been established, and the Governor instantly replied, that the government armed schooner was at his service, if he would himself go in quest of his former shipmates.</s> <s>Inconvenient as the absence at that time was to Captain Osborn, he at once acquiesced, and in a few days the schooner sailed for her destination.</s> <s>She arrived off the island on the same morning that the fleet of canoes with the savages effected their landing, and when William made the remark to Ready as they were hastening into the stockade, that there was another vessel under sail off the garden-point, had Ready had time to put his eye to the telescope, he would have discovered that it was the schooner.</s> </p>

<p pid="2033" id="masterman.c0.p2033"><s>The schooner stood in to the reefs, and then hauled off again, that she might send her boat in to sound for an anchorage.</s> <s>The boat, when sounding, perceived the canoes and the savages, and afterwards heard the report of firearms on the first attack.</s> <s>On her return on board the schooner, they stated what they had seen and heard, and their idea that the white people on the island were being attacked by the savages.</s> <s>As the boat did not return on board till near dusk, they had not time to canvas, the question when the night attack was made, and they again heard the firing of the muskets.</s> <s>This made Captain Osborn most anxious to land as soon as possible, but as the savages were in such numbers, and the crew of the schooner did not consist of more than twenty-five men, the commander considered it was rash to make the attempt.</s> <s>He did, however, show the utmost anxiety to bring his schooner to an anchor, so as to protect his men, and then agreed that they should land.</s> </p>

<p pid="2044" id="masterman.c0.p2044"><s>The hurry and bustle of preparing for their departure from the island, and the rapid succession of events which had been crowded together within so very few days, had not allowed time for much thought or reflection to Mr and Mrs Seagrave and William; at length, however, every preparation had been made, and they were no longer urged by the commander of the schooner to hasten their packing up and arrangements; for everything had been sent on board during the afternoon, and it was proposed that they should sail on the following day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2045" id="masterman.c0.p2045"><s>Now they had time to feel, and bitterly did they lament the loss of their old friend, and deplore that he had not survived to sail with them to Sydney.</s> <s>They had always indulged the hope that one day they should be taken off the island, and in that hope they had ever looked forward to old Ready becoming a part of their future household.</s> <s>Now that their wishes had been granted--so much was the feeling of joy and gratitude mingled with regret--that could he have been restored to them, they felt as if they would have gladly remained on the island.</s> </p>

<p pid="2046" id="masterman.c0.p2046"><s>Captain Osborn, the commander, and the crew of the schooner had taken leave of them for the night, and had gone on board, having made arrangements for the interment of Ready, previous to their sailing, on the following day.</s> <s>The children had been put to bed, and Juno had quitted the house; Mr and Mrs Seagrave and William were sitting together in their now half-dismantled room, when Juno entered; the poor girl had evidently been weeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="2047" id="masterman.c0.p2047" type="speech"><s>"Well, Juno," observed Mr Seagrave, with a view to break the silence which had continued for some time previous to her entrance, <qs/>"are you not glad to leave the island?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2048" id="masterman.c0.p2048"><s>"One time I think I would be very glad, but now I not care much," replied Juno.</s> <s>"Island very nice place, all very happy till savage come.</s> <s>Suppose they not kill old Ready, I not care."</s> </p>

<p pid="2049" id="masterman.c0.p2049" type="speech"><s>"Yes, indeed," said Mrs Seagrave, <qs/>"it is a sad blow to us all; I did hope to have fostered the good old man, and to have been able to have shown him our gratitude, but--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2050" id="masterman.c0.p2050" type="speech"><s>"It is the will of Heaven that it should be otherwise," continued Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"I would give half that I am possessed of, that he had not perished."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2051" id="masterman.c0.p2051" type="speech"><s>"Oh, Massa!" said Juno, <qs/>"I sit by him just now; I take off the flag and look at his face, so calm, look so happy, so good, I almost tink he smile at me, and then I cry.</s> <s>Oh!</s> <s>Massa Tommy, all because you idle boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2052" id="masterman.c0.p2052" type="speech"><s>"It adds much to my regret," replied Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"that his life should have been sacrificed through the thoughtlessness of one of my own children; what a lesson it will be to Tommy when he is old enough to comprehend the consequences of his conduct."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2053" id="masterman.c0.p2053" type="speech"><s>"That he must not know, papa," said William, who had been leaning mournfully over the table; <qs/>"one of Ready's last injunctions was that Tommy was never to be told of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2054" id="masterman.c0.p2054" type="speech"><s>"His last wishes shall be religiously attended to, my dear boy," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"for what do we not owe to that good old man?</s> <s>When others deserted us and left us to perish, he remained with us to share our fate.</s> <s>By his skill we were saved and landed in safety.</s> <s>He provided for our wants, added to our comforts, instructed us how to make the best use of our means.</s> <s>Without his precautions we should have perished by the spears of the savages.</s> <s>What an example of Christian fortitude and humility did he ever show us! and indeed, I may truly say, that by his example, sinful as I must ever be, I have become, I trust, a better man.</s> <s>Would that he were now sitting by us,--but the Lord's will be done!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2055" id="masterman.c0.p2055"><s>"I feel as if I had lost a stay or prop," replied Mrs Seagrave.</s> <s>"So accustomed have I been to look to him for advice since we have been on this island.</s> <s>Had he not been thus snatched from us--had he been spared to us a few years, and had we been permitted to surround his death-bed, and close his eyes in peace--" and Mrs Seagrave wept upon the shoulder of her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="2056" id="masterman.c0.p2056"><s>After a time, Mrs Seagrave recovered herself; but silence ensued, only broken by an occasional sob from poor Juno.</s> <s>William's heart was too full; he could not for a long while utter a word; at last he said in a low voice:</s> </p>

<p pid="2057" id="masterman.c0.p2057"><s>"I feel that, next to my dear father and mother, I have lost my best friend.</s> <s>I cannot forgive myself for allowing him to go for the water; it was my duty to go, and I ought to have gone."</s> </p>

<p pid="2058" id="masterman.c0.p2058"><s>"And yet we could have ill spared you, my dear boy; you might have perished," replied Mrs Seagrave.</s> </p>

<p pid="2059" id="masterman.c0.p2059" type="speech"><s>"It would have been as God willed," replied William; <qs/>"I might have perished, or I might not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2060" id="masterman.c0.p2060" type="speech"><s>"We never know what the morrow may bring forth," said Mr Seagrave, <qs/>"or what may be in store for us.</s> <s>Had not this misfortune happened, had old Ready been spared to us, how joyfully should I and all of you have quitted this island, full of anticipation, and indulging in worldly prospects.</s> <s>What a check have I received!</s> <s>I now am all thought and anxiety.</s> <s>I have said to myself, `we have been happy on this island; our wants have been supplied; even our comforts have been great.</s> <s>We have been under no temptations, for we have been isolated from the world; am I so sure that I shall be as happy in future as I have been?</s> <s>Am I confident, now my long-wished-for return to the world is about to take place, that I shall have no cause to lament that I ever quitted this peaceful, quiet spot?'</s> <s>I feel that it is a duty to my family that I should return to society, but I am far from feeling that our happiness may be increased.</s> <s>We have, however, a plain precept to follow, which is, to do our duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2061" id="masterman.c0.p2061" type="speech"><s>"Yes," replied Mrs Seagrave; <qs/>"I feel the truth of all you have just said.</s> <s>We are in his hands; let us put our trust in him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2062" id="masterman.c0.p2062" type="speech"><s>"We will," replied Mr Seagrave; <qs/>"but it is late, and we have to rise early to-morrow morning.</s> <s>This is the last evening which we shall pass on this island; let us return our thanks for the happiness we have enjoyed here.</s> <s>We thought to have quitted this spot in joy,--it is his will that we should leave it in sorrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2063" id="masterman.c0.p2063"><s>Mr Seagrave took down the Bible, and after he had read a chapter, he poured forth a prayer suited to their feelings, and they all retired to repose.</s> </p>

<p pid="2064" id="masterman.c0.p2064"><s>The next morning they were up early, and packed up the few articles which still remained to go on board.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave read the prayers, and they went to breakfast.</s> <s>Few words were exchanged, for there was a solemn grief upon all of them.</s> <s>They waited for the arrival of Captain Osborn and the crew of the schooner to attend the funeral of poor old Ready.</s> <s>William, who had gone out occasionally to look at the vessel, now came in, and said that two boats were pulling on shore.</s> <s>A few minutes afterwards, Captain Osborn and the commander of the schooner soon made their appearance.</s> <s>The coffin had been brought on shore; the body of Ready was put into it, and it was screwed down.</s> </p>

<p pid="2065" id="masterman.c0.p2065"><s>In half an hour all was prepared, and the family were summoned from the house.</s> <s>The coffin, covered with the Union Jack as a pall, was raised on the shoulders of six of the seamen, and they bore it to the grave, followed by Mrs Seagrave and the children, the commander of the schooner, and several of the men.</s> <s>Mr Seagrave read the funeral service, the grave was filled up, and they all walked back in silence.</s> <s>At the request of William, the commander of the schooner had ordered the carpenter to prepare an oak paling to put round the grave, and a board on which was written the name of the deceased and day of his death.</s> <s>As soon as this had been fixed up, William, with a deep sigh, followed the commander of the schooner to the house to announce that all was finished, and that the boat waited for them to embark.</s> </p>

<p pid="2066" id="masterman.c0.p2066"><s>"Come, my dear," said Mr Seagrave to his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="2067" id="masterman.c0.p2067" type="speech"><s>"I will, I will," replied Mrs Seagrave, <qs/>"but I don't know how it is, now that the hour is come, I really feel such pain at quitting this dear island.</s> <s>Had it not been for poor Ready's death, I really do think I should wish to remain."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2068" id="masterman.c0.p2068"><s>"I don't doubt but that you feel sorrow, my dear, but we must not keep Captain Osborn waiting."</s> </p>

<p pid="2069" id="masterman.c0.p2069"><s>As Mr Seagrave was aware that the commander of the schooner was anxious to get clear of the islands before night, he now led his wife down to the boat.</s> <s>They all embarked, and were soon on the deck of the schooner, from whence they continued to fix their eyes upon the island, while the men were heaving up the anchor.</s> <s>At last sail was made upon the vessel, the garden-point was cleared, and, as they ran away with a fair wind, each object on the shore became more indistinct.</s> <s>Still their eyes were turned in that direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="2070" id="masterman.c0.p2070"><s>As they ran down to the westward, they passed the cove where they had first landed, and Mr Seagrave directed Mrs Seagrave's attention to it.</s> <s>She remained for some time looking at it in silence, and then said as she turned away:</s> </p>

<p pid="2071" id="masterman.c0.p2071"><s>"We shall never be more happy than we were on that island, Seagrave."</s> </p>

<p pid="2072" id="masterman.c0.p2072"><s>"It will indeed be well, my dear, if we never are less happy," replied her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="2073" id="masterman.c0.p2073"><s>The schooner now ran fast through the water, and the island was every minute less distinct; after a time, the land was below the horizon, and the tops of the cocoa-nut trees only to be seen; these gradually disappeared.</s> <s>Juno watched on, and when at last nothing could be seen, she waved her handkerchief in the direction of the island, as if to bid it farewell, and then went down below to hide her grief.</s> </p>

<p pid="2074" id="masterman.c0.p2074"><s>The wind continued fair, and, after a favourable passage of little more than four weeks, they arrived at Sydney Cove, the port to which they were bound when they embarked from England on board of the good ship Pacific.</s> </p>
