<p pid="2" id="mopsa.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="mopsa.c1.s4">A boy, whom I knew very well, was once going through a meadow, which was full of buttercups.</s> <s sid="5" id="mopsa.c1.s5">The nurse and his baby sister were with him; and when they got to an old hawthorn, which grew in the hedge and was covered with blossom, they all sat down in its shade, and the nurse took out three slices of plum-cake, gave one to each of the children, and kept one for herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mopsa.c1.p3"><s sid="6" id="mopsa.c1.s6">While the boy was eating, he observed that this hedge was very high and thick, and that there was a great hollow in the trunk of the old thorn-tree, and he heard a twittering, as if there was a nest somewhere inside; so he thrust his head in, twisted himself round, and looked up.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mopsa.c1.p4"><s sid="7" id="mopsa.c1.s7">It was a very great thorn-tree, and the hollow was so large that two or three boys could have stood upright in it; and when he got used to the dim light in that brown, still place, he saw that a good way above his head there was a nest,--rather a curious one, too, for it was as large as a pair of blackbirds would have built,--and yet it was made of fine white wool and delicate bits of moss; in short, it was like a goldfinch's nest magnified three times.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mopsa.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mopsa.c1.s8">Just then he thought he heard some little voices cry, <qs/>"Jack!</s> <s sid="9" id="mopsa.c1.s9">Jack!"<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="mopsa.c1.s10">His baby sister was asleep, and the nurse was reading a story-book, so it could not have been either of them who called.</s> <s sid="11" id="mopsa.c1.s11"><qs/>"I must get in here,"<qe/> said the boy.</s> <s sid="12" id="mopsa.c1.s12"><qs/>"I wish this hole was larger."<qe/></s> <s sid="13" id="mopsa.c1.s13">So he began to wriggle and twist himself through, and just as he pulled in his last foot, he looked up, and three heads which had been peeping over the edge of the nest suddenly popped down again.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mopsa.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="mopsa.c1.s14"><qs/>"Those heads had no beaks, I am sure,"<qe/> said Jack, and he stood on tiptoe and poked in one of his fingers.</s> <s sid="15" id="mopsa.c1.s15"><qs/>"And the things have no feathers,"<qe/> he continued; so, the hollow being rather rugged, he managed to climb up and look in.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mopsa.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mopsa.c1.s16">His eyes were not used yet to the dim light; but he was sure those things were not birds,--no.</s> <s sid="17" id="mopsa.c1.s17">He poked them, and they took no notice; but when he snatched one of them out of the nest, it gave a loud squeak, and said, <qs/>"O don't, Jack!"<qe/> as plainly as possible, upon which he was so frightened that he lost his footing, dropped the thing, and slipped down himself.</s> <s sid="18" id="mopsa.c1.s18">Luckily, he was not hurt, nor the thing either; he could see it quite plainly now: it was creeping about like rather an old baby, and had on a little frock and pinafore.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mopsa.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mopsa.c1.s19"><qs/>"It's a fairy!"<qe/> exclaimed Jack to himself.</s> <s sid="20" id="mopsa.c1.s20"><qs/>"How curious! and this must be a fairy's nest.</s> <s sid="21" id="mopsa.c1.s21">Oh, how angry the old mother will be if this little thing creeps away and gets out of the hole!"<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="mopsa.c1.s22">So he looked down.</s> <s sid="23" id="mopsa.c1.s23"><qs/>"Oh, the hole is on the other side,"<qe/> he said; and he turned round, but the hole was not on the other side; it was not on any side; it must have closed up all on a sudden, while he was looking into the nest, for, look whichever way he would, there was no hole at all, excepting a very little one high up over the nest, which let in a very small sunbeam.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mopsa.c1.p9"><s sid="24" id="mopsa.c1.s24">Jack was very much astonished, but he went on eating his cake, and was so delighted to see the young fairy climb up the side of the hollow and scramble again into her nest, that he laughed heartily; upon which all the nestlings popped up their heads, and, showing their pretty white teeth, pointed at the slice of cake.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mopsa.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mopsa.c1.s25"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said Jack, <sse/><qs/>"I may have to stay inside here for a long time, and I have nothing to eat but this cake; however, your mouths are very small, so you shall have a piece;"<qe/> and he broke off a small piece, and put it into the nest, climbing up to see them eat it.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mopsa.c1.p11"><s sid="26" id="mopsa.c1.s26">These young fairies were a long time dividing and munching the cake, and before they had finished, it began to be rather dark, for a black cloud came over and covered the little sunbeam.</s> <s sid="27" id="mopsa.c1.s27">At the same time the wind rose, and rocked the boughs, and made the old tree creak and tremble.</s> <s sid="28" id="mopsa.c1.s28">Then there was thunder and rain, and the little fairies were so frightened that they got out of the nest and crept into Jack's pockets.</s> <s sid="29" id="mopsa.c1.s29">One got into each waistcoat pocket, and the other two were very comfortable, for he took out his handkerchief and made room for them in the pocket of his jacket.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mopsa.c1.p12"><s sid="30" id="mopsa.c1.s30">It got darker and darker, till at last Jack could only just see the hole, and it seemed to be a very long way off.</s> <s sid="31" id="mopsa.c1.s31">Every time he looked at it, it was farther off, and at last he saw a thin crescent moon shining through it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mopsa.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mopsa.c1.s32"><qs/>"I am sure it cannot be night yet,"<qe/> he said; and he took out one of the fattest of the young fairies, and held it up towards the hole.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mopsa.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mopsa.c1.s33"><qs/>"Look at that,"<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>"what is to be done now? the hole is so far off that it's night up there, and down here I haven't done eating my lunch."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mopsa.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mopsa.c1.s34"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> answered the young fairy, <sse/><qs/>"then why don't you whistle?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mopsa.c1.p16"><s sid="35" id="mopsa.c1.s35">Jack was surprised to hear her speak in this sensible manner, and in the light of the moon he looked at her very attentively.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mopsa.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mopsa.c1.s36"><qs/>"When first I saw you in the nest,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"you had a pinafore on, and now you have a smart little apron, with lace round it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mopsa.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="mopsa.c1.s37"><qs/>"That is because I am much older now,"<qe/><sss/> said the fairy; <sse/><qs/>"we never take such a long time to grow up as you do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mopsa.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="mopsa.c1.s38"><qs/>"But your pinafore?"<qe/> said Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mopsa.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mopsa.c1.s39"><qs/>"Turned into an apron, of course,"<qe/><sss/> replied the fairy, <sse/><qs/>"just as your velvet jacket will turn into a tail-coat when you are old enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mopsa.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mopsa.c1.s40"><qs/>"It won't,"<qe/> said Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mopsa.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mopsa.c1.s41"><qs/>"Yes it will,"<qe/> answered the fairy, with an air of superior wisdom.</s> <s sid="42" id="mopsa.c1.s42"><qs/>"Don't argue with me; I am older now than you are,--nearly grown up, in fact.</s> <s sid="43" id="mopsa.c1.s43">Put me into your pocket again, and whistle as loudly as you can."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mopsa.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mopsa.c1.s44">Jack laughed, put her in, and pulled out another.</s> <s sid="45" id="mopsa.c1.s45"><qs/>"Worse and worse,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"why, this was a boy fairy, and now he has a mustache and a sword, and looks as fierce as possible!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mopsa.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mopsa.c1.s46"><qs/>"I think I heard my sister tell you to whistle?"<qe/> said this fairy, very sternly.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mopsa.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mopsa.c1.s47"><qs/>"Yes, she did,"<qe/> said Jack.</s> <s sid="48" id="mopsa.c1.s48"><qs/>"Well, I suppose I had better do it."<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="mopsa.c1.s49">So he whistled very loudly indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mopsa.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mopsa.c1.s50"><qs/>"Why did you leave off so soon?"<qe/> said another of them, peeping out.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mopsa.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mopsa.c1.s51"><qs/>"Why, if you wish to know,"<qe/><sss/> answered Jack, <sse/><qs/>"it was because I thought something took hold of my legs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mopsa.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mopsa.c1.s52"><qs/>"Ridiculous child!"<qe/><sls/> cried the last of the four, <sle/><qs/>"how do you think you are ever to get out, if she doesn't take hold of your legs?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mopsa.c1.p29"><s sid="53" id="mopsa.c1.s53">Jack thought he would rather have done a long-division sum than have been obliged to whistle; but he could not help doing it when they told him, and he felt something take hold of his legs again, and then give him a jerk, which hoisted him on to its back, where he sat astride, and wondered whether the thing was a pony; but it was not, for he presently observed that it had a very slender neck, and then that it was covered with feathers.</s> <s sid="54" id="mopsa.c1.s54">It was a large bird, and he presently found that they were rising towards the hole, which had become so very far off, and in a few minutes she dashed through the hole, with Jack on her back and all the fairies in his pockets.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mopsa.c1.p30"><s sid="55" id="mopsa.c1.s55">It was so dark that he could see nothing, and he twined his arms round the bird's neck, to hold on, upon which this agreeable fowl told him not to be afraid, and said she hoped he was comfortable.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mopsa.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="mopsa.c1.s56"><qs/>"I should be more comfortable,"<qe/><sss/> replied Jack, <sse/><qs/>"if I knew how I could get home again.</s> <s sid="57" id="mopsa.c1.s57">I don't wish to go home just yet, for I want to see where we are flying to, but papa and mamma will be frightened if I never do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mopsa.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mopsa.c1.s58"><qs/>"Oh no,"<qe/><sls/> replied the albatross (for she was an albatross), <sle/><qs/>"you need not be at all afraid about that.</s> <s sid="59" id="mopsa.c1.s59">When boys go to Fairyland, their parents never are uneasy about them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mopsa.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mopsa.c1.s60"><qs/>"Really?"<qe/> exclaimed Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mopsa.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="mopsa.c1.s61"><qs/>"Quite true,"<qe/> replied the albatross.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mopsa.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mopsa.c1.s62"><qs/>"And so we are going to Fairyland?"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Jack; <sse/><qs/>"how delightful!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mopsa.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mopsa.c1.s63"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said the albatross; <sse/><qs/>"the back way, mind; we are only going the back way.</s> <s sid="64" id="mopsa.c1.s64">You could go in two minutes by the usual route; but these young fairies want to go before they are summoned, and therefore you and I are taking them."<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="mopsa.c1.s65">And she continued to fly on in the dark sky for a very long time.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mopsa.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mopsa.c1.s66"><qs/>"They seem to be all fast asleep,"<qe/> said Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mopsa.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="mopsa.c1.s67"><qs/>"Perhaps they will sleep till we come to the wonderful river,"<qe/> replied the albatross; and just then she flew with a great bump against something that met her in the air.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mopsa.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="mopsa.c1.s68"><qs/>"What craft is this that hangs out no light?"<qe/> said a gruff voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mopsa.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mopsa.c1.s69"><qs/>"I might ask the same question of you,"<qe/> answered the albatross, sullenly.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mopsa.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="mopsa.c1.s70"><qs/>"I'm only a poor Will-o'-the-wisp,"<qe/><sss/> replied the voice, <sse/><qs/>"and you know very well that I have but a lantern to show."<qe/></s> <s sid="71" id="mopsa.c1.s71">Thereupon a lantern became visible, and Jack saw by the light of it a man, who looked old and tired, and he was so transparent that you could see through him, lantern and all.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mopsa.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mopsa.c1.s72"><qs/>"I hope I have not hurt you, William,"<qe/><sss/> said the albatross; <sse/><qs/>"I will light up immediately.</s> <s sid="73" id="mopsa.c1.s73">Good-night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mopsa.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mopsa.c1.s74"><qs/>"Good-night,"<qe/> answered the Will-o'-the-wisp.</s> <s sid="75" id="mopsa.c1.s75"><qs/>"I am going down as fast as I can; the storm blew me up, and I am never easy excepting in my native swamps."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mopsa.c1.p44"><s sid="76" id="mopsa.c1.s76">Jack might have taken more notice of Will, if the albatross had not begun to light up.</s> <s sid="77" id="mopsa.c1.s77">She did it in this way.</s> <s sid="78" id="mopsa.c1.s78">First, one of her eyes began to gleam with a beautiful green light, which cast its rays far and near, and then, when it was as bright as a lamp, the other eye began to shine, and the light of that eye was red.</s> <s sid="79" id="mopsa.c1.s79">In short, she was lighted up just like a vessel at sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mopsa.c1.p45"><s sid="80" id="mopsa.c1.s80">Jack was so happy that he hardly knew which to look at first, there really were so many remarkable things.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mopsa.c1.p46" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="mopsa.c1.s81"><qs/>"They snore,"<qe/><sss/> said the albatross, <sse/><qs/>"they are very fast asleep, and before they wake I should like to talk to you a little."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mopsa.c1.p47"><s sid="82" id="mopsa.c1.s82">She meant that the fairies snored, and so they did, in Jack's pockets.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="mopsa.c1.p48" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="mopsa.c1.s83"><qs/>"My name,"<qe/><sss/> continued the albatross, <sse/><qs/>"is Jenny.</s> <s sid="84" id="mopsa.c1.s84">Do you think you shall remember that? because, when you are in Fairyland and want some one to take you home again, and call <alt-qs/>'Jenny,'<alt-qe/> I shall be able to come to you; and I shall come with pleasure, for I like boys better than fairies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mopsa.c1.p49" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="mopsa.c1.s85"><qs/>"Thank you,"<qe/> said Jack.</s> <s sid="86" id="mopsa.c1.s86"><qs/>"Oh yes, I shall remember your name, it is such a very easy one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="mopsa.c1.p50" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="mopsa.c1.s87"><qs/>"If it is in the night that you want me, just look up,"<qe/><sss/> continued the albatross, <sse/><qs/>"and you will see a green and a red spark moving in the air; you will then call Jenny, and I will come; but remember that I cannot come unless you do call me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="mopsa.c1.p51" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="mopsa.c1.s88"><qs/>"Very well,"<qe/> said Jack; but he was not attending, because there was so much to be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="mopsa.c1.p52"><s sid="89" id="mopsa.c1.s89">In the first place, all the stars excepting a few large ones were gone, and they looked frightened; and as it got lighter, one after the other seemed to give a little start in the blue sky and go out.</s> <s sid="90" id="mopsa.c1.s90">And then Jack looked down and saw, as he thought, a great country, covered with very jagged snow mountains with astonishingly sharp peaks.</s> <s sid="91" id="mopsa.c1.s91">Here and there he saw a very deep lake,--at least he thought it was a lake; but while he was admiring the mountains, there came an enormous crack between two of the largest, and he saw the sun come rolling up among them, and it seemed to be almost smothered.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="mopsa.c1.p53" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="mopsa.c1.s92"><qs/>"Why, those are clouds!"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Jack; <sse/><qs/>"and O how rosy they have all turned!</s> <s sid="93" id="mopsa.c1.s93">I thought they were mountains."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="mopsa.c1.p54" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="mopsa.c1.s94"><qs/>"Yes, they are clouds,"<qe/> said the albatross; and then they turned gold color; and next they began to plunge and tumble, and every one of the peaks put on a glittering crown; and next they broke themselves to pieces, and began to drift away.</s> <s sid="95" id="mopsa.c1.s95">In fact, Jack had been out all night, and now it was morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mopsa.c4.p31"><s sid="50" id="mopsa.c4.s50">The country was not so open as a park,--it was more like a half-cleared woodland; but there was a wide space just where the boat was steering for, that had no trees, only a few flowering shrubs.</s> <s sid="51" id="mopsa.c4.s51">Here groups of strange-looking people were bustling about, and there were shrill fifes sounding, and drums.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mopsa.c4.p37" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="mopsa.c4.s59"><qs/>"Stay where you are!"<qe/> cried Jack to the boat; and at that instant such a splendid moth rose slowly, that he sprang on shore after it, and quite forgot the fair and the people in his desire to follow it.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mopsa.c4.p40"><s sid="64" id="mopsa.c4.s64">They were full of splendid things,--clocks and musical boxes, strange china ornaments, embroidered slippers, red caps, and many kinds of splendid silks and small carpets.</s> <s sid="65" id="mopsa.c4.s65">In other booths were swords and dirks, glittering with jewels; and the chatter of the people when they talked together was not in a language that Jack could understand.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mopsa.c4.p43"><s sid="69" id="mopsa.c4.s69">Outside the canopy was white or brownish; but when Jack stood under these tents, he saw that they were lined with splendid flutings of brown or pink silk: what looked like silk, at least, for it was impossible to be sure whether these were real tents or gigantic mushrooms.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mopsa.c4.p44"><s sid="70" id="mopsa.c4.s70">They varied in size, also, as mushrooms do, and in shape: some were large enough for twenty people to stand under them, and had flat tops with a brown lining; others had dome-shaped roofs; these were lined with pink, and would only shelter six or seven.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mopsa.c4.p45"><s sid="71" id="mopsa.c4.s71">The people who sold in these tents were as strange as their neighbors; each had a little high cap on his head, in shape just like a beehive, and it was made of straw, and had a little hole in front.</s> <s sid="72" id="mopsa.c4.s72">In fact, Jack very soon saw bees flying in and out, and it was evident that these people had their honey made on the premises.</s> <s sid="73" id="mopsa.c4.s73">They were chiefly selling country produce.</s> <s sid="74" id="mopsa.c4.s74">They had cheeses so large as to reach to their waists, and the women trundled them along as boys do their hoops.</s> <s sid="75" id="mopsa.c4.s75">They sold a great many kinds of seed, too, in wooden bowls, and cakes and good things to eat, such as gilt gingerbread.</s> <s sid="76" id="mopsa.c4.s76">Jack bought some of this, and found it very nice indeed.</s> <s sid="77" id="mopsa.c4.s77">But when he took out his money to pay for it, the little man looked rather strangely at it, and turned it over with an air of disgust.</s> <s sid="78" id="mopsa.c4.s78">Then Jack saw him hand it to his wife, who also seemed to dislike it; and presently Jack observed that they followed him about, first on one side, then on the other.</s> <s sid="79" id="mopsa.c4.s79">At last, the little woman slipped her hand into his pocket, and Jack, putting his hand in directly, found his sixpence had been returned.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mopsa.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mopsa.c5.s8"><qs/>"She has a baby,"<qe/> observed the parrot-wife, scornfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mopsa.c5.p7"><s sid="12" id="mopsa.c5.s12">There she was indeed, almost close at hand.</s> <s sid="13" id="mopsa.c5.s13">She had a little cart; her goods were hung all about it, and a small horse drew it slowly on, and stopped when she got a customer.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mopsa.c5.p8"><s sid="14" id="mopsa.c5.s14">Several gypsy children were with her, and as the people came running together over the grass to see her goods, she sang a curious kind of song, which made them wish to buy them.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mopsa.c5.p9"><s sid="15" id="mopsa.c5.s15">Jack turned from the parrot's cage as she came up.</s> <s sid="16" id="mopsa.c5.s16">He had heard her singing a little way off, and now, before she began again, he felt that already her searching eyes had found him out, and taken notice that he was different from the other people.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mopsa.c5.p10"><s sid="17" id="mopsa.c5.s17">When she began to sing her selling song, he felt a most curious sensation.</s> <s sid="18" id="mopsa.c5.s18">He felt as if there were some cobwebs before his face, and he put up his hand as if to clear them away.</s> <s sid="19" id="mopsa.c5.s19">There were no real cobwebs, of course; and yet he again felt as if they floated from the gypsy woman to him, like gossamer threads, and attracted him towards her.</s> <s sid="20" id="mopsa.c5.s20">So he gazed at her, and she at him, till Jack began to forget how the parrot had warned him.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mopsa.c5.p11"><s sid="21" id="mopsa.c5.s21">He saw her baby too, wondered whether it was heavy for her to carry, and wished he could help her.</s> <s sid="22" id="mopsa.c5.s22">I mean, he saw that she had a baby on her arm.</s> <s sid="23" id="mopsa.c5.s23">It was wrapped in a shawl, and had a handkerchief over its face.</s> <s sid="24" id="mopsa.c5.s24">She seemed very fond of it, for she kept hushing it; and Jack softly moved nearer and nearer to the cart, till the gypsy woman smiled, and suddenly began to sing,--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mopsa.c5.p12" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mopsa.c5.s25">My good man--he's an old, old man And my good man got a fall, To buy me a bargain so fast he ran When he heard the gypsies call:</s> <s sid="26" id="mopsa.c5.s26"><qs/>"Buy, buy brushes, Baskets wrought o' rushes.</s> <s sid="27" id="mopsa.c5.s27">Buy them, buy them, take them, try them, Buy, dames all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mopsa.c5.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mopsa.c5.s33">When the gypsy had finished her song, Jack felt as if he was covered all over with cobwebs; but he could not move away, and he did not mind them now.</s> <s sid="34" id="mopsa.c5.s34">All his wish was to please her, and get close to her; so when she said, in a soft, wheedling voice, <qs/>"What will you please to buy, my pretty gentleman?"<qe/> he was just going to answer that he would buy anything she recommended, when, to his astonishment and displeasure, for he thought it very rude, the parrot suddenly burst into a violent fit of coughing, which made all the customers stare.</s> <s sid="35" id="mopsa.c5.s35"><qs/>"That's to clear my throat,"<qe/> he said, in a most impertinent tone of voice; and then he began to beat time with his foot, and sing, or rather scream out, an extremely saucy imitation of the gypsy's song, and all his parrot friends in the other cages joined in the chorus.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mopsa.c5.p15" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mopsa.c5.s36">My fair lady's a dear, dear lady-- I walked by her side to woo.</s> <s sid="37" id="mopsa.c5.s37">In a garden alley, so sweet and shady, She answered, <qs/>"I love not you, John, John Brady,"<qe/><sss/> Quoth my dear lady, <sse/><qs/>"Pray now, pray now, go your way now, Do, John, do!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mopsa.c5.p16"><s sid="38" id="mopsa.c5.s38">At first the gypsy did not seem to know where that mocking song came from, but when she discovered that it was her prisoner, the old parrot, who was thus daring to imitate her, she stood silent and glared at him, and her face was almost white with rage.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mopsa.c5.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mopsa.c5.s39">When he came to the end of the verse he pretended to burst into a violent fit of sobbing and crying, and screeched out to his wife, <qs/>"Mate! mate! hand up my handkerchief.</s> <s sid="40" id="mopsa.c5.s40">Oh! oh! it's so affecting, this song is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mopsa.c5.p18"><s sid="41" id="mopsa.c5.s41">Upon this the other parrot pulled Jack's handkerchief from under her wing, hobbled up, and began, with a great show of zeal, to wipe his horny beak with it.</s> <s sid="42" id="mopsa.c5.s42">But this was too much for the gypsy; she took a large brush from her cart, and flung it at the cage with all her might.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mopsa.c5.p19" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="mopsa.c5.s43">This set it violently swinging backwards and forwards, but did not stop the parrot, who screeched out, <qs/>"How delightful it is to be swung!"<qe/></s> <s sid="44" id="mopsa.c5.s44">And then he began to sing another verse in the most impudent tone possible, and with a voice that seemed to ring through Jack's head, and almost pierce it:--</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mopsa.c5.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mopsa.c5.s45">Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady, For I passed another day; While making her moan, she sat all alone, And thus and thus did she say:</s> <s sid="46" id="mopsa.c5.s46"><qs/>"John, John Brady,"<qe/><sss/> Quoth my dear lady, <sse/><qs/>"Do now, do now, once more woo now, Pray, John, pray!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mopsa.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mopsa.c5.s47"><qs/>"It's beautiful!"<qe/><sss/> screeched the parrot-wife, <sse/><qs/>"and so ap-pro-pri-ate."<qe/></s> <s sid="48" id="mopsa.c5.s48">Jack was delighted when she managed slowly to say this long word with her black tongue, and he burst out laughing.</s> <s sid="49" id="mopsa.c5.s49">In the mean time a good many of the brown people came running together, attracted by the noise of the parrots and the rage of the gypsy, who flung at his cage, one after the other, all the largest things she had in her cart.</s> <s sid="50" id="mopsa.c5.s50">But nothing did the parrot any harm; the more violently his cage swung, the louder he sang, till at last the wicked gypsy seized her poor little young baby, who was lying in her arms, rushed frantically at the cage as it flew swiftly through the air towards her, and struck at it with the little creature's head.</s> <s sid="51" id="mopsa.c5.s51"><qs/>"Oh, you cruel, cruel woman!"<qe/> cried Jack, and all the small mothers who were standing near with their skinny children on their shoulders, screamed out with terror and indignation; but only for one instant, for the handkerchief flew off that had covered its face, and was caught in the wires of the cage, and all the people saw that it was not a real baby at all, but a bundle of clothes, and its head was a turnip.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mopsa.c5.p22"><s sid="52" id="mopsa.c5.s52">Yes, a turnip!</s> <s sid="53" id="mopsa.c5.s53">You could see that as plainly as possible, for though the green leaves had been cut off, their stalks were visible through the lace cap that had been tied on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mopsa.c5.p23" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="mopsa.c5.s54">Upon this all the crowd pressed closer, throwing her baskets, and brushes, and laces, and beads at the gypsy, and calling out, <qs/>"We will have none of your goods, you false woman!</s> <s sid="55" id="mopsa.c5.s55">Give us back our money, or we will drive you out of the fair.</s> <s sid="56" id="mopsa.c5.s56">You've stuck a stick into a turnip, and dressed it up in baby clothes.</s> <s sid="57" id="mopsa.c5.s57">You're a cheat! a cheat!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mopsa.c5.p24" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mopsa.c5.s58"><qs/>"My sweet gentlemen, my kind ladies,"<qe/> began the gypsy; but baskets and brushes flew at her so fast that she was obliged to sit down on the grass and hold up the sham baby to screen her face.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mopsa.c5.p25"><s sid="59" id="mopsa.c5.s59">While this was going on, Jack felt that the cobwebs which had seemed to float about his face were all gone; he did not care at all any more about the gypsy, and began to watch the parrots with great attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mopsa.c5.p26"><s sid="60" id="mopsa.c5.s60">He observed that when the handkerchief stuck between the cage wires, the parrots caught it, and drew it inside; and then Jack saw the cunning old bird himself lay it on the floor, fold it crosswise like a shawl, and put it on his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mopsa.c5.p27"><s sid="61" id="mopsa.c5.s61">Then she jumped upon the perch, and held it with one foot, looking precisely like an old lady with a parrot's head.</s> <s sid="62" id="mopsa.c5.s62">Then he folded Jack's handkerchief in the same way, put it on, and got upon the perch beside his wife, screaming out, in his most piercing tone,--</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mopsa.c5.p28" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mopsa.c5.s63"><qs/>"I like shawls; they're so becoming."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mopsa.c5.p29"><s sid="64" id="mopsa.c5.s64">Now the gypsy did not care at all what those inferior people thought of her, and she was calmly counting out their money, to return it; but she was very desirous to make Jack forget her behavior, and had begun to smile again, and tell him she had only been joking, when the parrot spoke, and, looking up, she saw the two birds sitting side by side, and the parrot-wife was screaming in her mate's ear, though neither of them was at all deaf,--</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mopsa.c5.p30" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="mopsa.c5.s65"><qs/>"If Jack lets her allure him into the woods, he'll never come out again.</s> <s sid="66" id="mopsa.c5.s66">She'll hang him up in a cage, as she did us.</s> <s sid="67" id="mopsa.c5.s67">I say, how does my shawl fit?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mopsa.c5.p31"><s sid="68" id="mopsa.c5.s68">So saying, the parrot-wife whisked herself round on the perch, and lo! in the corner of the handkerchief were seen some curious letters, marked in red.</s> <s sid="69" id="mopsa.c5.s69">When the crowd saw these, they drew a little farther off, and glanced at one another with alarm.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mopsa.c5.p32" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="mopsa.c5.s70"><qs/>"You look charming, my dear; it fits well!"<qe/> screamed the old parrot in answer.</s> <s sid="71" id="mopsa.c5.s71"><qs/>"A word in your ear; 'Share and share alike' is a fine motto."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mopsa.c5.p33" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mopsa.c5.s72"><qs/>"What do you mean by all this?"<qe/> said the gypsy, rising, and going with slow steps to the cage, and speaking cautiously.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mopsa.c5.p34" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="mopsa.c5.s73"><qs/>"Jack,"<qe/><sss/> said the parrot, <sse/><qs/>"do they ever eat handkerchiefs in your part of the country?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mopsa.c5.p35" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mopsa.c5.s74"><qs/>"No, never,"<qe/> answered Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mopsa.c5.p36" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="mopsa.c5.s75"><qs/>"Hold your tongue and be reasonable,"<qe/> said the gypsy, trembling.</s> <s sid="76" id="mopsa.c5.s76"><qs/>"What do you want?</s> <s sid="77" id="mopsa.c5.s77">I'll do it, whatever it is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mopsa.c5.p37" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="mopsa.c5.s78"><qs/>"But do they never pick out the marks?"<qe/> continued the parrot.</s> <s sid="79" id="mopsa.c5.s79"><qs/>"O Jack! are you sure they never pick out the marks?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mopsa.c5.p38" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="mopsa.c5.s80"><qs/>"The marks?"<qe/> said Jack, considering.</s> <s sid="81" id="mopsa.c5.s81"><qs/>"Yes, perhaps they do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mopsa.c5.p39" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="mopsa.c5.s82"><qs/>"Stop!"<qe/> cried the gypsy, as the old parrot made a peck at the strange letters.</s> <s sid="83" id="mopsa.c5.s83"><qs/>"Oh! you're hurting me.</s> <s sid="84" id="mopsa.c5.s84">What do you want?</s> <s sid="85" id="mopsa.c5.s85">I say again, tell me what you want, and you shall have it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mopsa.c5.p40" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="mopsa.c5.s86"><qs/>"We want to get out,"<qe/><sss/> replied the parrot; <sse/><qs/>"you must undo the spell."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mopsa.c5.p41" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="mopsa.c5.s87"><qs/>"Then give me my handkerchief,"<qe/><sss/> answered the gypsy, <sse/><qs/>"to bandage my eyes.</s> <s sid="88" id="mopsa.c5.s88">I dare not say the words with my eyes open.</s> <s sid="89" id="mopsa.c5.s89">You had no business to steal it.</s> <s sid="90" id="mopsa.c5.s90">It was woven by human hands, so that nobody can see through it; and if you don't give it to me, you'll never get out,--no, never!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mopsa.c5.p42" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="mopsa.c5.s91"><qs/>"Then,"<qe/><sls/> said the old parrot, tossing his shawl off, <sle/><qs/>"you may have Jack's handkerchief; it will bandage your eyes just as well.</s> <s sid="92" id="mopsa.c5.s92">It was woven over the water, as yours was."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mopsa.c5.p43" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="mopsa.c5.s93"><qs/>"It won't do!"<qe/><sls/> cried the gypsy, in terror; <sle/><qs/>"give me my own."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mopsa.c5.p44" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="mopsa.c5.s94"><qs/>"I tell you,"<qe/><sss/> answered the parrot, <sse/><qs/>"that you shall have Jack's handkerchief; you can do no harm with that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mopsa.c5.p45"><s sid="95" id="mopsa.c5.s95">By this time the parrots all around had become perfectly silent, and none of the people ventured to say a word, for they feared the malice of the gypsy.</s> <s sid="96" id="mopsa.c5.s96">She was trembling dreadfully, and her dark eyes, which had been so bright and piercing, had become dull and almost dim; but when she found there was no help for it, she said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mopsa.c5.p47" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="mopsa.c5.s99"><qs/>"Share and share alike,"<qe/><sss/> answered the parrot; <sse/><qs/>"you must let all my friends out too."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mopsa.c5.p49" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="mopsa.c5.s103"><qs/>"My friends, then,"<qe/> answered the brave old parrot; and he poked Jack's handkerchief out to her through the wires.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="mopsa.c5.p50"><s sid="104" id="mopsa.c5.s104">The wondering crowd stood by to look, and the gypsy bandaged her eyes tightly with the handkerchief; and then, stooping low, she began to murmur something and clap her hands--softly at first, but by degrees more and more violently.</s> <s sid="105" id="mopsa.c5.s105">The noise was meant to drown the words she muttered; but as she went on clapping, the bottom of cage after cage fell clattering down.</s> <s sid="106" id="mopsa.c5.s106">Out flew the parrots by hundreds, screaming and congratulating one another; and there was such a deafening din that not only the sound of her spell, but the clapping of her hands, was quite lost in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="mopsa.c5.p51" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="mopsa.c5.s107">But all this time Jack was very busy; for the moment the gypsy had tied up her eyes, the old parrot snatched the real handkerchief off his wife's shoulders, and tied it round her neck.</s> <s sid="108" id="mopsa.c5.s108">Then she pushed out her head through the wires, and the old parrot called to Jack, and said, <qs/>"Pull!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="mopsa.c5.p56"><s sid="114" id="mopsa.c5.s114">Jack flung down the old parrot's head and great beak, for he saw that what he had to do was to clear the fairy of its parrot covering.</s> <s sid="115" id="mopsa.c5.s115">The poor little creature seemed nearly dead, it was so terribly squeezed in the wires.</s> <s sid="116" id="mopsa.c5.s116">It had a green gown or robe on, with an ermine collar; and Jack got hold of this dress, stripped the fairy out of the parrot feathers, and dragged her through,--velvet robe, and crimson girdle, and little yellow shoes.</s> <s sid="117" id="mopsa.c5.s117">She was very much exhausted, but a kind brown woman took her instantly, and laid her in her bosom.</s> <s sid="118" id="mopsa.c5.s118">She was a splendid little creature, about half a foot long.</s> </p>
