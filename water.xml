<p pid="4" id="water.c1.p4"><s sid="4" id="water.c1.s4">Once upon a time there was a little chimney-sweep, and his name was Tom.</s> <s sid="5" id="water.c1.s5">That is a short name, and you have heard it before, so you will not have much trouble in remembering it.</s> <s sid="6" id="water.c1.s6">He lived in a great town in the North country, where there were plenty of chimneys to sweep, and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his master to spend.</s> <s sid="7" id="water.c1.s7">He could not read nor write, and did not care to do either; and he never washed himself, for there was no water up the court where he lived.</s> <s sid="8" id="water.c1.s8">He had never been taught to say his prayers.</s> <s sid="9" id="water.c1.s9">He never had heard of God, or of Christ, except in words which you never have heard, and which it would have been well if he had never heard.</s> <s sid="10" id="water.c1.s10">He cried half his time, and laughed the other half.</s> <s sid="11" id="water.c1.s11">He cried when he had to climb the dark flues, rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw; and when the soot got into his eyes, which it did every day in the week; and when his master beat him, which he did every day in the week; and when he had not enough to eat, which happened every day in the week likewise.</s> <s sid="12" id="water.c1.s12">And he laughed the other half of the day, when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys, or playing leap-frog over the posts, or bowling stones at the horses' legs as they trotted by, which last was excellent fun, when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide.</s> <s sid="13" id="water.c1.s13">As for chimney-sweeping, and being hungry, and being beaten, he took all that for the way of the world, like the rain and snow and thunder, and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over, as his old donkey did to a hail- storm; and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever; and thought of the fine times coming, when he would be a man, and a master sweep, and sit in the public-house with a quart of beer and a long pipe, and play cards for silver money, and wear velveteens and ankle-jacks, and keep a white bull-dog with one gray ear, and carry her puppies in his pocket, just like a man.</s> <s sid="14" id="water.c1.s14">And he would have apprentices, one, two, three, if he could.</s> <s sid="15" id="water.c1.s15">How he would bully them, and knock them about, just as his master did to him; and make them carry home the soot sacks, while he rode before them on his donkey, with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button-hole, like a king at the head of his army.</s> <s sid="16" id="water.c1.s16">Yes, there were good times coming; and, when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer, Tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="water.c1.p5"><s sid="17" id="water.c1.s17">One day a smart little groom rode into the court where Tom lived.</s> <s sid="18" id="water.c1.s18">Tom was just hiding behind a wall, to heave half a brick at his horse's legs, as is the custom of that country when they welcome strangers; but the groom saw him, and halloed to him to know where Mr. Grimes, the chimney-sweep, lived.</s> <s sid="19" id="water.c1.s19">Now, Mr. Grimes was Tom's own master, and Tom was a good man of business, and always civil to customers, so he put the half-brick down quietly behind the wall, and proceeded to take orders.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="water.c1.p6"><s sid="20" id="water.c1.s20">Mr. Grimes was to come up next morning to Sir John Harthover's, at the Place, for his old chimney-sweep was gone to prison, and the chimneys wanted sweeping.</s> <s sid="21" id="water.c1.s21">And so he rode away, not giving Tom time to ask what the sweep had gone to prison for, which was a matter of interest to Tom, as he had been in prison once or twice himself.</s> <s sid="22" id="water.c1.s22">Moreover, the groom looked so very neat and clean, with his drab gaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie with a smart pin in it, and clean round ruddy face, that Tom was offended and disgusted at his appearance, and considered him a stuck-up fellow, who gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes, and other people paid for them; and went behind the wall to fetch the half- brick after all; but did not, remembering that he had come in the way of business, and was, as it were, under a flag of truce.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="water.c1.p7"><s sid="23" id="water.c1.s23">His master was so delighted at his new customer that he knocked Tom down out of hand, and drank more beer that night than he usually did in two, in order to be sure of getting up in time next morning; for the more a man's head aches when he wakes, the more glad he is to turn out, and have a breath of fresh air.</s> <s sid="24" id="water.c1.s24">And, when he did get up at four the next morning, he knocked Tom down again, in order to teach him (as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools) that he must be an extra good boy that day, as they were going to a very great house, and might make a very good thing of it, if they could but give satisfaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="water.c1.p8"><s sid="25" id="water.c1.s25">And Tom thought so likewise, and, indeed, would have done and behaved his best, even without being knocked down.</s> <s sid="26" id="water.c1.s26">For, of all places upon earth, Harthover Place (which he had never seen) was the most wonderful, and, of all men on earth, Sir John (whom he had seen, having been sent to gaol by him twice) was the most awful.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="water.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="water.c1.s27">Harthover Place was really a grand place, even for the rich North country; with a house so large that in the frame-breaking riots, which Tom could just remember, the Duke of Wellington, and ten thousand soldiers to match, were easily housed therein; at least, so Tom believed; with a park full of deer, which Tom believed to be monsters who were in the habit of eating children; with miles of game-preserves, in which Mr. Grimes and the collier lads poached at times, on which occasions Tom saw pheasants, and wondered what they tasted like; with a noble salmon-river, in which Mr. Grimes and his friends would have liked to poach; but then they must have got into cold water, and that they did not like at all.</s> <s sid="28" id="water.c1.s28">In short, Harthover was a grand place, and Sir John a grand old man, whom even Mr. Grimes respected; for not only could he send Mr. Grimes to prison when he deserved it, as he did once or twice a week; not only did he own all the land about for miles; not only was he a jolly, honest, sensible squire, as ever kept a pack of hounds, who would do what he thought right by his neighbours, as well as get what he thought right for himself; but, what was more, he weighed full fifteen stone, was nobody knew how many inches round the chest, and could have thrashed Mr. Grimes himself in fair fight, which very few folk round there could do, and which, my dear little boy, would not have been right for him to do, as a great many things are not which one both can do, and would like very much to do.</s> <s sid="29" id="water.c1.s29">So Mr. Grimes touched his hat to him when he rode through the town, and called him a <qs/>"buirdly awd chap,"<qe/><sss/> and his young ladies <sse/><qs/>"gradely lasses,"<qe/> which are two high compliments in the North country; and thought that that made up for his poaching Sir John's pheasants; whereby you may perceive that Mr. Grimes had not been to a properly-inspected Government National School.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="water.c1.p10"><s sid="30" id="water.c1.s30">Now, I dare say, you never got up at three o'clock on a midsummer morning.</s> <s sid="31" id="water.c1.s31">Some people get up then because they want to catch salmon; and some because they want to climb Alps; and a great many more because they must, like Tom.</s> <s sid="32" id="water.c1.s32">But, I assure you, that three o'clock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the twenty-four hours, and all the three hundred and sixty-five days; and why every one does not get up then, I never could tell, save that they are all determined to spoil their nerves and their complexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all day.</s> <s sid="33" id="water.c1.s33">But Tom, instead of going out to dinner at half-past eight at night, and to a ball at ten, and finishing off somewhere between twelve and four, went to bed at seven, when his master went to the public-house, and slept like a dead pig; for which reason he was as piert as a game-cock (who always gets up early to wake the maids), and just ready to get up when the fine gentlemen and ladies were just ready to go to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="water.c1.p11"><s sid="34" id="water.c1.s34">So he and his master set out; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining gray in the gray dawn.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="water.c1.p12"><s sid="35" id="water.c1.s35">They passed through the pitmen's village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then the were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the pit- engine in the next field.</s> <s sid="36" id="water.c1.s36">But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall's foot grew long grass and gay flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark saying his matins high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="water.c1.p13"><s sid="37" id="water.c1.s37">All else was silent.</s> <s sid="38" id="water.c1.s38">For old Mrs. Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake.</s> <s sid="39" id="water.c1.s39">The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day's business in the clear blue overhead.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="water.c1.p14"><s sid="40" id="water.c1.s40">On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds' nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business, and would not have heard of that.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="water.c1.p15"><s sid="41" id="water.c1.s41">Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back.</s> <s sid="42" id="water.c1.s42">She had a gray shawl over her head, and a crimson madder petticoat; so you may be sure she came from Galway.</s> <s sid="43" id="water.c1.s43">She had neither shoes nor stockings, and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright gray eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks.</s> <s sid="44" id="water.c1.s44">And she took Mr. Grimes' fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="water.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="water.c1.s45"><qs/>"This is a hard road for a gradely foot like that.</s> <s sid="46" id="water.c1.s46">Will ye up, lass, and ride behind me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="water.c1.p17"><s sid="47" id="water.c1.s47">But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes' look and voice; for she answered quietly:</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="water.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="water.c1.s48"><qs/>"No, thank you:</s> <s sid="49" id="water.c1.s49">I'd sooner walk with your little lad here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="water.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="water.c1.s50"><qs/>"You may please yourself,"<qe/> growled Grimes, and went on smoking.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="water.c1.p20"><s sid="51" id="water.c1.s51">So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman.</s> <s sid="52" id="water.c1.s52">And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! and seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="water.c1.p21"><s sid="53" id="water.c1.s53">Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea.</s> <s sid="54" id="water.c1.s54">And Tom asked her about the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="water.c1.p22"><s sid="55" id="water.c1.s55">At last, at the bottom of a hill, they came to a spring; not such a spring as you see here, which soaks up out of a white gravel in the bog, among red fly-catchers, and pink bottle-heath, and sweet white orchis; nor such a one as you may see, too, here, which bubbles up under the warm sandbank in the hollow lane by the great tuft of lady ferns, and makes the sand dance reels at the bottom, day and night, all the year round; not such a spring as either of those; but a real North country limestone fountain, like one of those in Sicily or Greece, where the old heathen fancied the nymphs sat cooling themselves the hot summer's day, while the shepherds peeped at them from behind the bushes.</s> <s sid="56" id="water.c1.s56">Out of a low cave of rock, at the foot of a limestone crag, the great fountain rose, quelling, and bubbling, and gurgling, so clear that you could not tell where the water ended and the air began; and ran away under the road, a stream large enough to turn a mill; among blue geranium, and golden globe-flower, and wild raspberry, and the bird-cherry with its tassels of snow.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="water.c1.p23"><s sid="57" id="water.c1.s57">And there Grimes stopped, and looked; and Tom looked too.</s> <s sid="58" id="water.c1.s58">Tom was wondering whether anything lived in that dark cave, and came out at night to fly in the meadows.</s> <s sid="59" id="water.c1.s59">But Grimes was not wondering at all.</s> <s sid="60" id="water.c1.s60">Without a word, he got off his donkey, and clambered over the low road wall, and knelt down, and began dipping his ugly head into the spring--and very dirty he made it.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="water.c1.p24"><s sid="61" id="water.c1.s61">Tom was picking the flowers as fast as he could.</s> <s sid="62" id="water.c1.s62">The Irishwoman helped him, and showed him how to tie them up; and a very pretty nosegay they had made between them.</s> <s sid="63" id="water.c1.s63">But when he saw Grimes actually wash, he stopped, quite astonished; and when Grimes had finished, and began shaking his ears to dry them, he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="water.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="water.c1.s64"><qs/>"Why, master, I never saw you do that before."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="water.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="water.c1.s65"><qs/>"Nor will again, most likely.</s> <s sid="66" id="water.c1.s66">'Twasn't for cleanliness I did it, but for coolness.</s> <s sid="67" id="water.c1.s67">I'd be ashamed to want washing every week or so, like any smutty collier lad."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="water.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="water.c1.s68"><qs/>"I wish I might go and dip my head in,"<qe/> said poor little Tom.</s> <s sid="69" id="water.c1.s69"><qs/>"It must be as good as putting it under the town-pump; and there is no beadle here to drive a chap away."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="water.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="water.c1.s70"><qs/>"Thou come along,"<qe/><sss/> said Grimes; <sse/><qs/>"what dost want with washing thyself?</s> <s sid="71" id="water.c1.s71">Thou did not drink half a gallon of beer last night, like me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="water.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="water.c1.s72"><qs/>"I don't care for you,"<qe/> said naughty Tom, and ran down to the stream, and began washing his face.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="water.c1.p30"><s sid="73" id="water.c1.s73">Grimes was very sulky, because the woman preferred Tom's company to his; so he dashed at him with horrid words, and tore him up from his knees, and began beating him.</s> <s sid="74" id="water.c1.s74">But Tom was accustomed to that, and got his head safe between Mr. Grimes' legs, and kicked his shins with all his might.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="water.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="water.c1.s75"><qs/>"Are you not ashamed of yourself, Thomas Grimes?"<qe/> cried the Irishwoman over the wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="water.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="water.c1.s76">Grimes looked up, startled at her knowing his name; but all he answered was, <qs/>"No, nor never was yet;"<qe/> and went on beating Tom.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="water.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="water.c1.s77"><qs/>"True for you.</s> <s sid="78" id="water.c1.s78">If you ever had been ashamed of yourself, you would have gone over into Vendale long ago."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="water.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="water.c1.s79"><qs/>"What do you know about Vendale?"<qe/> shouted Grimes; but he left off beating Tom.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="water.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="water.c1.s80"><qs/>"I know about Vendale, and about you, too.</s> <s sid="81" id="water.c1.s81">I know, for instance, what happened in Aldermire Copse, by night, two years ago come Martinmas."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="water.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="water.c1.s82"><qs/>"You do?"<qe/> shouted Grimes; and leaving Tom, he climbed up over the wall, and faced the woman.</s> <s sid="83" id="water.c1.s83">Tom thought he was going to strike her; but she looked him too full and fierce in the face for that.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="water.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="water.c1.s84"><qs/>"Yes; I was there,"<qe/> said the Irishwoman quietly.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="water.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="water.c1.s85"><qs/>"You are no Irishwoman, by your speech,"<qe/> said Grimes, after many bad words.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="water.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="water.c1.s86"><qs/>"Never mind who I am.</s> <s sid="87" id="water.c1.s87">I saw what I saw; and if you strike that boy again, I can tell what I know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="water.c1.p40"><s sid="88" id="water.c1.s88">Grimes seemed quite cowed, and got on his donkey without another word.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="water.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="water.c1.s89"><qs/>"Stop!"<qe/> said the Irishwoman.</s> <s sid="90" id="water.c1.s90"><qs/>"I have one more word for you both; for you will both see me again before all is over.</s> <s sid="91" id="water.c1.s91">Those that wish to be clean, clean they will be; and those that wish to be foul, foul they will be.</s> <s sid="92" id="water.c1.s92">Remember."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="water.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="water.c1.s93">And she turned away, and through a gate into the meadow.</s> <s sid="94" id="water.c1.s94">Grimes stood still a moment, like a man who had been stunned.</s> <s sid="95" id="water.c1.s95">Then he rushed after her, shouting, <qs/>"You come back."<qe/></s> <s sid="96" id="water.c1.s96">But when he got into the meadow, the woman was not there.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="water.c1.p43"><s sid="97" id="water.c1.s97">Had she hidden away?</s> <s sid="98" id="water.c1.s98">There was no place to hide in.</s> <s sid="99" id="water.c1.s99">But Grimes looked about, and Tom also, for he was as puzzled as Grimes himself at her disappearing so suddenly; but look where they would, she was not there.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="water.c1.p44"><s sid="100" id="water.c1.s100">Grimes came back again, as silent as a post, for he was a little frightened; and, getting on his donkey, filled a fresh pipe, and smoked away, leaving Tom in peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="water.c1.p45"><s sid="101" id="water.c1.s101">And now they had gone three miles and more, and came to Sir John's lodge-gates.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="water.c1.p46"><s sid="102" id="water.c1.s102">Very grand lodges they were, with very grand iron gates and stone gate-posts, and on the top of each a most dreadful bogy, all teeth, horns, and tail, which was the crest which Sir John's ancestors wore in the Wars of the Roses; and very prudent men they were to wear it, for all their enemies must have run for their lives at the very first sight of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="water.c1.p47"><s sid="103" id="water.c1.s103">Grimes rang at the gate, and out came a keeper on the spot, and opened.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="water.c1.p48" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="water.c1.s104"><qs/>"I was told to expect thee,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="105" id="water.c1.s105"><qs/>"Now thou'lt be so good as to keep to the main avenue, and not let me find a hare or a rabbit on thee when thou comest back.</s> <s sid="106" id="water.c1.s106">I shall look sharp for one, I tell thee."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="water.c1.p49" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="water.c1.s107"><qs/>"Not if it's in the bottom of the soot-bag,"<qe/> quoth Grimes, and at that he laughed; and the keeper laughed and said:</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="water.c1.p50" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="water.c1.s108"><qs/>"If that's thy sort, I may as well walk up with thee to the hall."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="water.c1.p51" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="water.c1.s109"><qs/>"I think thou best had.</s> <s sid="110" id="water.c1.s110">It's thy business to see after thy game, man, and not mine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="water.c1.p52"><s sid="111" id="water.c1.s111">So the keeper went with them; and, to Tom's surprise, he and Grimes chatted together all the way quite pleasantly.</s> <s sid="112" id="water.c1.s112">He did not know that a keeper is only a poacher turned outside in, and a poacher a keeper turned inside out.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="water.c1.p53"><s sid="113" id="water.c1.s113">They walked up a great lime avenue, a full mile long, and between their stems Tom peeped trembling at the horns of the sleeping deer, which stood up among the ferns.</s> <s sid="114" id="water.c1.s114">Tom had never seen such enormous trees, and as he looked up he fancied that the blue sky rested on their heads.</s> <s sid="115" id="water.c1.s115">But he was puzzled very much by a strange murmuring noise, which followed them all the way.</s> <s sid="116" id="water.c1.s116">So much puzzled, that at last he took courage to ask the keeper what it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="water.c1.p54"><s sid="117" id="water.c1.s117">He spoke very civilly, and called him Sir, for he was horribly afraid of him, which pleased the keeper, and he told him that they were the bees about the lime flowers.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="water.c1.p55" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="water.c1.s118"><qs/>"What are bees?"<qe/> asked Tom.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="water.c1.p56" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="water.c1.s119"><qs/>"What make honey."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="water.c3.p19"><s sid="45" id="water.c3.s45">And in the water-forest he saw the water-monkeys and water- squirrels (they had all six legs, though; everything almost has six legs in the water, except efts and water-babies); and nimbly enough they ran among the branches.</s> <s sid="46" id="water.c3.s46">There were water-flowers there too, in thousands; and Tom tried to pick them:  but as soon as he touched them, they drew themselves in and turned into knots of jelly; and then Tom saw that they were all alive--bells, and stars, and wheels, and flowers, of all beautiful shapes and colours; and all alive and busy, just as Tom was.</s> <s sid="47" id="water.c3.s47">So now he found that there was a great deal more in the world than he had fancied at first sight.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="water.c3.p22"><s sid="55" id="water.c3.s55">Now you must know that all the things under the water talk; only not such a language as ours; but such as horses, and dogs, and cows, and birds talk to each other; and Tom soon learned to understand them and talk to them; so that he might have had very pleasant company if he had only been a good boy.</s> <s sid="56" id="water.c3.s56">But I am sorry to say, he was too like some other little boys, very fond of hunting and tormenting creatures for mere sport.</s> <s sid="57" id="water.c3.s57">Some people say that boys cannot help it; that it is nature, and only a proof that we are all originally descended from beasts of prey.</s> <s sid="58" id="water.c3.s58">But whether it is nature or not, little boys can help it, and must help it.</s> <s sid="59" id="water.c3.s59">For if they have naughty, low, mischievous tricks in their nature, as monkeys have, that is no reason why they should give way to those tricks like monkeys, who know no better.</s> <s sid="60" id="water.c3.s60">And therefore they must not torment dumb creatures; for if they do, a certain old lady who is coming will surely give them exactly what they deserve.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="water.c3.p24"><s sid="62" id="water.c3.s62">The water-fairies, of course, were very sorry to see him so unhappy, and longed to take him, and tell him how naughty he was, and teach him to be good, and to play and romp with him too:  but they had been forbidden to do that.</s> <s sid="63" id="water.c3.s63">Tom had to learn his lesson for himself by sound and sharp experience, as many another foolish person has to do, though there may be many a kind heart yearning over them all the while, and longing to teach them what they can only teach themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="water.c3.p25" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="water.c3.s64">At last one day he found a caddis, and wanted it to peep out of its house:  but its house-door was shut.</s> <s sid="65" id="water.c3.s65">He had never seen a caddis with a house-door before:  so what must he do, the meddlesome little fellow, but pull it open, to see what the poor lady was doing inside.</s> <s sid="66" id="water.c3.s66">What a shame!</s> <s sid="67" id="water.c3.s67">How should you like to have any one breaking your bedroom-door in, to see how you looked when you where in bed?</s> <s sid="68" id="water.c3.s68">So Tom broke to pieces the door, which was the prettiest little grating of silk, stuck all over with shining bits of crystal; and when he looked in, the caddis poked out her head, and it had turned into just the shape of a bird's.</s> <s sid="69" id="water.c3.s69">But when Tom spoke to her she could not answer; for her mouth and face were tight tied up in a new night-cap of neat pink skin.</s> <s sid="70" id="water.c3.s70">However, if she didn't answer, all the other caddises did; for they held up their hands and shrieked like the cats in Struwelpeter:</s> <s sid="71" id="water.c3.s71"><qs/>"Oh, you nasty horrid boy; there you are at it again!</s> <s sid="72" id="water.c3.s72">And she had just laid herself up for a fortnight's sleep, and then she would have come out with such beautiful wings, and flown about, and laid such lots of eggs:  and now you have broken her door, and she can't mend it because her mouth is tied up for a fortnight, and she will die.</s> <s sid="73" id="water.c3.s73">Who sent you here to worry us out of our lives?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="water.c3.p26"><s sid="74" id="water.c3.s74">So Tom swam away.</s> <s sid="75" id="water.c3.s75">He was very much ashamed of himself, and felt all the naughtier; as little boys do when they have done wrong and won't say so.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="water.c3.p27"><s sid="76" id="water.c3.s76">Then he came to a pool full of little trout, and began tormenting them, and trying to catch them:  but they slipped through his fingers, and jumped clean out of water in their fright.</s> <s sid="77" id="water.c3.s77">But as Tom chased them, he came close to a great dark hover under an alder root, and out floushed a huge old brown trout ten times as big as he was, and ran right against him, and knocked all the breath out of his body; and I don't know which was the more frightened of the two.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="water.c3.p28"><s sid="78" id="water.c3.s78">Then he went on sulky and lonely, as he deserved to be; and under a bank he saw a very ugly dirty creature sitting, about half as big as himself; which had six legs, and a big stomach, and a most ridiculous head with two great eyes and a face just like a donkey's.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="water.c4.p4"><s sid="5" id="water.c4.s5">So the salmon went up, after Tom had warned them of the wicked old otter; and Tom went down, but slowly and cautiously, coasting along shore.</s> <s sid="6" id="water.c4.s6">He was many days about it, for it was many miles down to the sea; and perhaps he would never have found his way, if the fairies had not guided him, without his seeing their fair faces, or feeling their gentle hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="water.c4.p6"><s sid="12" id="water.c4.s12">Suddenly, he saw a beautiful sight.</s> <s sid="13" id="water.c4.s13">A bright red light moved along the river-side, and threw down into the water a long tap-root of flame.</s> <s sid="14" id="water.c4.s14">Tom, curious little rogue that he was, must needs go and see what it was; so he swam to the shore, and met the light as it stopped over a shallow run at the edge of a low rock.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="water.c4.p7"><s sid="15" id="water.c4.s15">And there, underneath the light, lay five or six great salmon, looking up at the flame with their great goggle eyes, and wagging their tails, as if they were very much pleased at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="water.c4.p8"><s sid="16" id="water.c4.s16">Tom came to the top, to look at this wonderful light nearer, and made a splash.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="water.c4.p12"><s sid="21" id="water.c4.s21">The man with the torch bent down over the water, and looked earnestly in; and then he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="water.c4.p15"><s sid="25" id="water.c4.s25">And then, from behind, there sprang on these three men three other men; and there were shouts, and blows, and words which Tom recollected to have heard before; and he shuddered and turned sick at them now, for he felt somehow that they were strange, and ugly, and wrong, and horrible.</s> <s sid="26" id="water.c4.s26">And it all began to come back to him.</s> <s sid="27" id="water.c4.s27">They were men; and they were fighting; savage, desperate, up-and- down fighting, such as Tom had seen too many times before.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="water.c4.p17"><s sid="29" id="water.c4.s29">All of a sudden there was a tremendous splash, and a frightful flash, and a hissing, and all was still.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="water.c4.p21"><s sid="40" id="water.c4.s40">The moon shone so bright that Tom could see every feature; and, as he saw, he recollected, bit by bit, it was his old master, Grimes.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="water.c4.p22"><s sid="41" id="water.c4.s41">Tom turned tail, and swam away as fast as he could.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="water.c4.p24"><s sid="45" id="water.c4.s45">So he went up the river again a little way, and lay there the rest of the night under an alder root; but, when morning came, he longed to go down again to the big pool, and see whether Mr. Grimes had turned into a water-baby yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="water.c4.p25"><s sid="46" id="water.c4.s46">So he went very carefully, peeping round all the rocks, and hiding under all the roots.</s> <s sid="47" id="water.c4.s47">Mr. Grimes lay there still; he had not turned into a water-baby.</s> <s sid="48" id="water.c4.s48">In the afternoon Tom went back again.</s> <s sid="49" id="water.c4.s49">He could not rest till he had found out what had become of Mr. Grimes.</s> <s sid="50" id="water.c4.s50">But this time Mr. Grimes was gone; and Tom made up his mind that he was turned into a water-baby.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="water.c4.p26"><s sid="51" id="water.c4.s51">He might have made himself easy, poor little man; Mr. Grimes did not turn into a water-baby, or anything like one at all.</s> <s sid="52" id="water.c4.s52">But he did not make himself easy; and a long time he was fearful lest he should meet Grimes suddenly in some deep pool.</s> <s sid="53" id="water.c4.s53">He could not know that the fairies had carried him away, and put him, where they put everything which falls into the water, exactly where it ought to be.</s> <s sid="54" id="water.c4.s54">But, do you know, what had happened to Mr. Grimes had such an effect on him that he never poached salmon any more.</s> <s sid="55" id="water.c4.s55">And it is quite certain that, when a man becomes a confirmed poacher, the only way to cure him is to put him under water for twenty-four hours, like Grimes.</s> <s sid="56" id="water.c4.s56">So when you grow to be a big man, do you behave as all honest fellows should; and never touch a fish or a head of game which belongs to another man without his express leave; and then people will call you a gentleman, and treat you like one; and perhaps give you good sport:  instead of hitting you into the river, or calling you a poaching snob.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="water.c4.p27"><s sid="57" id="water.c4.s57">Then Tom went on down, for he was afraid of staying near Grimes: and as he went, all the vale looked sad.</s> <s sid="58" id="water.c4.s58">The red and yellow leaves showered down into the river; the flies and beetles were all dead and gone; the chill autumn fog lay low upon the hills, and sometimes spread itself so thickly on the river that he could not see his way.</s> <s sid="59" id="water.c4.s59">But he felt his way instead, following the flow of the stream, day after day, past great bridges, past boats and barges, past the great town, with its wharfs, and mills, and tall smoking chimneys, and ships which rode at anchor in the stream; and now and then he ran against their hawsers, and wondered what they were, and peeped out, and saw the sailors lounging on board smoking their pipes; and ducked under again, for he was terribly afraid of being caught by man and turned into a chimney-sweep once more.</s> <s sid="60" id="water.c4.s60">He did not know that the fairies were close to him always, shutting the sailors' eyes lest they should see him, and turning him aside from millraces, and sewer-mouths, and all foul and dangerous things.</s> <s sid="61" id="water.c4.s61">Poor little fellow, it was a dreary journey for him; and more than once he longed to be back in Vendale, playing with the trout in the bright summer sun.</s> <s sid="62" id="water.c4.s62">But it could not be.</s> <s sid="63" id="water.c4.s63">What has been once can never come over again.</s> <s sid="64" id="water.c4.s64">And people can be little babies, even water-babies, only once in their lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="water.c4.p28"><s sid="65" id="water.c4.s65">Besides, people who make up their minds to go and see the world, as Tom did, must needs find it a weary journey.</s> <s sid="66" id="water.c4.s66">Lucky for them if they do not lose heart and stop half-way, instead of going on bravely to the end as Tom did.</s> <s sid="67" id="water.c4.s67">For then they will remain neither boys nor men, neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring:  having learnt a great deal too much, and yet not enough; and sown their wild oats, without having the advantage of reaping them.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="water.c4.p29"><s sid="68" id="water.c4.s68">But Tom was always a brave, determined, little English bull-dog, who never knew when he was beaten; and on and on he held, till he saw a long way off the red buoy through the fog.</s> <s sid="69" id="water.c4.s69">And then he found to his surprise, the stream turned round, and running up inland.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="water.c4.p31" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="water.c4.s74">He did not care now for the tide being against him.</s> <s sid="75" id="water.c4.s75">The red buoy was in sight, dancing in the open sea; and to the buoy he would go, and to it he went.</s> <s sid="76" id="water.c4.s76">He passed great shoals of bass and mullet, leaping and rushing in after the shrimps, but he never heeded them, or they him; and once he passed a great black shining seal, who was coming in after the mullet.</s> <s sid="77" id="water.c4.s77">The seal put his head and shoulders out of water, and stared at him, looking exactly like a fat old greasy negro with a gray pate.</s> <s sid="78" id="water.c4.s78">And Tom, instead of being frightened, said, <qs/>"How d'ye do, sir; what a beautiful place the sea is!"<qe/></s> <s sid="79" id="water.c4.s79">And the old seal, instead of trying to bite him, looked at him with his soft sleepy winking eyes, and said, <qs/>"Good tide to you, my little man; are you looking for your brothers and sisters?</s> <s sid="80" id="water.c4.s80">I passed them all at play outside."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="water.c4.p32" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="water.c4.s81"><qs/>"Oh, then,"<qe/><sss/> said Tom, <sse/><qs/>"I shall have playfellows at last,"<qe/> and he swam on to the buoy, and got upon it (for he was quite out of breath) and sat there, and looked round for water-babies:  but there were none to be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="water.c4.p33" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="water.c4.s82">The sea-breeze came in freshly with the tide and blew the fog away; and the little waves danced for joy around the buoy, and the old buoy danced with them.</s> <s sid="83" id="water.c4.s83">The shadows of the clouds ran races over the bright blue bay, and yet never caught each other up; and the breakers plunged merrily upon the wide white sands, and jumped up over the rocks, to see what the green fields inside were like, and tumbled down and broke themselves all to pieces, and never minded it a bit, but mended themselves and jumped up again.</s> <s sid="84" id="water.c4.s84">And the terns hovered over Tom like huge white dragon-flies with black heads, and the gulls laughed like girls at play, and the sea-pies, with their red bills and legs, flew to and fro from shore to shore, and whistled sweet and wild.</s> <s sid="85" id="water.c4.s85">And Tom looked and looked, and listened; and he would have been very happy, if he could only have seen the water-babies.</s> <s sid="86" id="water.c4.s86">Then when the tide turned, he left the buoy, and swam round and round in search of them:  but in vain.</s> <s sid="87" id="water.c4.s87">Sometimes he thought he heard them laughing:  but it was only the laughter of the ripples.</s> <s sid="88" id="water.c4.s88">And sometimes he thought he saw them at the bottom: but it was only white and pink shells.</s> <s sid="89" id="water.c4.s89">And once he was sure he had found one, for he saw two bright eyes peeping out of the sand.</s> <s sid="90" id="water.c4.s90">So he dived down, and began scraping the sand away, and cried, <qs/>"Don't hide; I do want some one to play with so much!"<qe/></s> <s sid="91" id="water.c4.s91">And out jumped a great turbot with his ugly eyes and mouth all awry, and flopped away along the bottom, knocking poor Tom over.</s> <s sid="92" id="water.c4.s92">And he sat down at the bottom of the sea, and cried salt tears from sheer disappointment.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="water.c4.p34"><s sid="93" id="water.c4.s93">To have come all this way, and faced so many dangers, and yet to find no water-babies!</s> <s sid="94" id="water.c4.s94">How hard!</s> <s sid="95" id="water.c4.s95">Well, it did seem hard:  but people, even little babies, cannot have all they want without waiting for it, and working for it too, my little man, as you will find out some day.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="water.c4.p35"><s sid="96" id="water.c4.s96">And Tom sat upon the buoy long days, long weeks, looking out to sea, and wondering when the water-babies would come back; and yet they never came.</s> </p>

<title>MORAL.</title>
<p pid="1" id="water.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="water.c8.s1">And now, my dear little man, what should we learn from this parable?</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="water.c8.p2"><s sid="2" id="water.c8.s2">We should learn thirty-seven or thirty-nine things, I am not exactly sure which:  but one thing, at least, we may learn, and that is this--when we see efts in the pond, never to throw stones at them, or catch them with crooked pins, or put them into vivariums with sticklebacks, that the sticklebacks may prick them in their poor little stomachs, and make them jump out of the glass into somebody's work-box, and so come to a bad end.</s> <s sid="3" id="water.c8.s3">For these efts are nothing else but the water-babies who are stupid and dirty, and will not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean; and, therefore (as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years hence, though they are not learned enough to tell you now), their skulls grow flat, their jaws grow out, and their brains grow small, and their tails grow long, and they lose all their ribs (which I am sure you would not like to do), and their skins grow dirty and spotted, and they never get into the clear rivers, much less into the great wide sea, but hang about in dirty ponds, and live in the mud, and eat worms, as they deserve to do.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="water.c8.p3"><s sid="4" id="water.c8.s4">But that is no reason why you should ill-use them:  but only why you should pity them, and be kind to them, and hope that some day they will wake up, and be ashamed of their nasty, dirty, lazy, stupid life, and try to amend, and become something better once more.</s> <s sid="5" id="water.c8.s5">For, perhaps, if they do so, then after 379,423 years, nine months, thirteen days, two hours, and twenty-one minutes (for aught that appears to the contrary), if they work very hard and wash very hard all that time, their brains may grow bigger, and their jaws grow smaller, and their ribs come back, and their tails wither off, and they will turn into water-babies again, and perhaps after that into land-babies; and after that perhaps into grown men.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="water.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="water.c8.s6">You know they won't?</s> <s sid="7" id="water.c8.s7">Very well, I daresay you know best.</s> <s sid="8" id="water.c8.s8">But you see, some folks have a great liking for those poor little efts.</s> <s sid="9" id="water.c8.s9">They never did anybody any harm, or could if they tried; and their only fault is, that they do no good--any more than some thousands of their betters.</s> <s sid="10" id="water.c8.s10">But what with ducks, and what with pike, and what with sticklebacks, and what with water-beetles, and what with naughty boys, they are <qs/>"sae sair hadden doun,"<qe/> as the Scotsmen say, that it is a wonder how they live; and some folks can't help hoping, with good Bishop Butler, that they may have another chance, to make things fair and even, somewhere, somewhen, somehow.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="water.c8.p5"><s sid="11" id="water.c8.s11">Meanwhile, do you learn your lessons, and thank God that you have plenty of cold water to wash in; and wash in it too, like a true Englishman.</s> <s sid="12" id="water.c8.s12">And then, if my story is not true, something better is; and if I am not quite right, still you will be, as long as you stick to hard work and cold water.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="water.c8.p6"><s sid="13" id="water.c8.s13">But remember always, as I told you at first, that this is all a fairy tale, and only fun and pretence:  and, therefore, you are not to believe a word of it, even if it is true.</s> </p>
