<title>CHAPTER I. HORACE VENTIMORE RECEIVES A COMMISSION</title>
<p pid="1" id="brass.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c1.s1">"This day six weeks--just six weeks ago!"</s> <s sid="2" id="brass.c1.s2">Horace Ventimore said, half aloud, to himself, and pulled out his watch.</s> <s sid="3" id="brass.c1.s3">"Half-past twelve--what was I doing at half-past twelve?"</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="brass.c1.s4">As he sat at the window of his office in Great Cloister Street, Westminster, he made his thoughts travel back to a certain glorious morning in August which now seemed so remote and irrecoverable.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c1.s5">At this precise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hotel de la Plage--the sole hostelry of St.</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c1.s6">Luc-en-Port, the tiny Normandy watering-place upon which, by some happy inspiration, he had lighted during a solitary cycling tour--waiting until She should appear.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="brass.c1.s7">He could see the whole scene: the tiny cove, with the violet shadow of the cliff sleeping on the green water; the swell of the waves lazily lapping against the diving-board from which he had plunged half an hour before; he remembered the long swim out to the buoy; the exhilarated anticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the hotel terrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="brass.c1.s8">For was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in Sylvia Futvoye's society?</s> <s sid="9" id="brass.c1.s9">Were they not to cycle together (there were, of course, others of the party--but they did not count), to cycle over to Veulettes, to picnic there under the cliff, and ride back--always together--in the sweet-scented dusk, over the slopes, between the poplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c1.p5"><s sid="10" id="brass.c1.s10">Now he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of the hotel with a sudden dread of missing her.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c1.s11">There was nothing there but the little low cart, with its canvas tilt which was to convey Professor Futvoye and his wife to the place of _rendezvous_.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c1.p6"><s sid="12" id="brass.c1.s12">There was Sylvia at last, distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink blouse and cream-coloured skirt; how gracious and friendly and generally delightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day, which was supreme amongst others only a little less perfect, and all now fled for ever!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c1.p7"><s sid="13" id="brass.c1.s13">They had had drawbacks, it was true.</s> <s sid="14" id="brass.c1.s14">Old Futvoye was perhaps the least bit of a bore at times, with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian art and ancient Oriental character-writing, in which he seemed convinced that Horace must feel a perfervid interest, as, indeed, he thought it politic to affect.</s> <s sid="15" id="brass.c1.s15">The Professor was a most learned archaeologist, and positively bulged with information on his favourite subjects; but it is just possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the distinction between Cuneiform and Aramaean or Kufic and Arabic inscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody else.</s> <s sid="16" id="brass.c1.s16">However, such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of sincerity.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c1.p8"><s sid="17" id="brass.c1.s17">So with self-tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures from that Norman holiday of his: the little half-timbered cottages with their faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch roofs; the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze-green beeches; the bold headlands, their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting grimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them; the tethered black-and-white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis lazuli and malachite sea, and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia's near presence, the sound of her voice in his ears.</s> <s sid="18" id="brass.c1.s18">And now?... He looked up from the papers and tracing-cloth on his desk, and round the small panelled room which served him as an office, at the framed plans and photographs, the set squares and T squares on the walls, and felt a dull resentment against his surroundings.</s> <s sid="19" id="brass.c1.s19">From his window he commanded a cheerful view of a tall, mouldering wall, once part of the Abbey boundaries, surmounted by _chevaux-de-frise_, above whose rust-attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing branches.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c1.p9"><s sid="20" id="brass.c1.s20">"She would have come to care for me," Horace's thoughts ran on, disjointedly.</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c1.s21">"I could have sworn that that last day of all--and her people didn't seem to object to me.</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c1.s22">Her mother asked me cordially enough to call on them when they were back in town.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c1.s23">When I did----"</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c1.p10"><s sid="24" id="brass.c1.s24">When he had called, there had been a difference--not an unusual sequel to an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering-place.</s> <s sid="25" id="brass.c1.s25">It was difficult to define, but unmistakable--a certain formality and constraint on Mrs. Futvoye's part, and even on Sylvia's, which seemed intended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the Channel passage.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c1.s26">So he had gone away sore at heart, but fully recognising that any advances in future must come from their side.</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c1.s27">They might ask him to dinner, or at least to call again; but more than a month had passed, and they had made no sign.</s> <s sid="28" id="brass.c1.s28">No, it was all over; he must consider himself dropped.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c1.p11"><s sid="29" id="brass.c1.s29">"After all," he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful laugh, "it's natural enough.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c1.s30">Mrs. Futvoye has probably been making inquiries about my professional prospects.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c1.s31">It's better as it is.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c1.s32">What earthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own?</s> <s sid="33" id="brass.c1.s33">It's all I can do to keep myself decently.</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c1.s34">I've no right to dream of asking any one--to say nothing of Sylvia--to marry me.</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c1.s35">I should only be rushing into temptation if I saw any more of her.</s> <s sid="36" id="brass.c1.s36">She's not for a poor beggar like me, who was born unlucky.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c1.s37">Well, whining won't do any good--let's have a look at Beevor's latest performance."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c1.p12"><s sid="38" id="brass.c1.s38">He spread out a large coloured plan, in a corner of which appeared the name of "William Beevor, Architect," and began to study it in a spirit of anything but appreciation.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c1.p13"><s sid="39" id="brass.c1.s39">"Beevor gets on," he said to himself.</s> <s sid="40" id="brass.c1.s40">"Heaven knows that I don't grudge him his success.</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c1.s41">He's a good fellow--though he _does_ build architectural atrocities, and seem to like 'em.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c1.s42">Who am I to give myself airs?</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c1.s43">He's successful--I'm not.</s> <s sid="44" id="brass.c1.s44">Yet if I only had his opportunities, what wouldn't I make of them!"</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c1.p14"><s sid="45" id="brass.c1.s45">Let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self-delusion of an incompetent.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c1.s46">Ventimore really had talent above the average, with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c1.p15"><s sid="47" id="brass.c1.s47">But he was not quite energetic enough, besides being too proud, to push himself into notice, and hitherto he had met with persistent ill-luck.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c1.p16"><s sid="48" id="brass.c1.s48">So Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor, whose offices and clerk he shared, such slight assistance as he might require, and it was by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced semi-idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and fame, for he had already passed his twenty-eighth birthday.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c1.p17"><s sid="49" id="brass.c1.s49">If Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time it was not altogether incomprehensible.</s> <s sid="50" id="brass.c1.s50">Horace Ventimore was not a model of manly beauty--models of manly beauty are rare out of novels, and seldom interesting in them; but his clear-cut, clean-shaven face possessed a certain distinction, and if there were faint satirical lines about the mouth, they were redeemed by the expression of the grey-blue eyes, which were remarkably frank and pleasant.</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c1.s51">He was well made, and tall enough to escape all danger of being described as short; fair-haired and pale, without being unhealthily pallid, in complexion, and he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came, and whose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might darken his horizon.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c1.p18"><s sid="52" id="brass.c1.s52">There was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor's office, and Beevor himself, a florid, thick-set man, with small side-whiskers, burst in.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c1.p19"><s sid="53" id="brass.c1.s53">"I say, Ventimore, you didn't run off with the plans for that house I'm building at Larchmere, did you?</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c1.s54">Because--ah, I see you're looking over them.</s> <s sid="55" id="brass.c1.s55">Sorry to deprive you, but----"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c1.p20"><s sid="56" id="brass.c1.s56">"Thanks, old fellow, take them, by all means.</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c1.s57">I've seen all I wanted to see."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c1.p21"><s sid="58" id="brass.c1.s58">"Well, I'm just off to Larchmere now.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c1.s59">Want to be there to check the quantities, and there's my other house at Fittlesdon.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c1.s60">I must go on afterwards and set it out, so I shall probably be away some days.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c1.s61">I'm taking Harrison down, too.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c1.s62">You won't be wanting him, eh?"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c1.p22"><s sid="63" id="brass.c1.s63">Ventimore laughed.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c1.s64">"I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help me.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c1.s65">Your necessity is greater than mine.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c1.s66">Here are the plans."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="brass.c1.s67">"I'm rather pleased with 'em myself, you know," said Beevor; "that roof ought to look well, eh?</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c1.s68">Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that ornamental tile-work along the top.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c1.s69">You saw I put in one of your windows with just a trifling addition.</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c1.s70">I was almost inclined to keep both gables alike, as you suggested, but it struck me a little variety--one red brick and the other <qs/>'parged'<qe/>--would be more out-of-the-way."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c1.p24"><s sid="71" id="brass.c1.s71">"Oh, much," agreed Ventimore, knowing that to disagree was useless.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c1.p25"><s sid="72" id="brass.c1.s72">"Not, mind you," continued Beevor, "that I believe in going in for too much originality in domestic architecture.</s> <s sid="73" id="brass.c1.s73">The average client no more wants an original house than he wants an original hat; he wants something he won't feel a fool in.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c1.s74">I've often thought, old man, that perhaps the reason why you haven't got on----you don't mind my speaking candidly, do you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c1.p26"><s sid="75" id="brass.c1.s75">"Not a bit," said Ventimore, cheerfully.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c1.s76">"Candour's the cement of friendship.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c1.s77">Dab it on."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c1.p27"><s sid="78" id="brass.c1.s78">"Well, I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those confoundedly unconventional ideas of yours.</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c1.s79">If you had your chance to-morrow, it's my belief you'd throw it away by insisting on some fantastic fad or other."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c1.p28"><s sid="80" id="brass.c1.s80">"These speculations are a trifle premature, considering that there doesn't seem the remotest prospect of my ever getting a chance at all."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c1.p29"><s sid="81" id="brass.c1.s81">"I got mine before I'd set up six months," said Beevor.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c1.s82">"The great thing, however," he went on, with a flavour of personal application, "is to know how to use it when it _does_ come.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c1.s83">Well, I must be off if I mean to catch that one o'clock from Waterloo.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c1.s84">You'll see to anything that may come in for me while I'm away, won't you, and let me know?</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c1.s85">Oh, by the way, the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that schoolroom at Woodford--do you mind running through them and seeing they're right?</s> <s sid="86" id="brass.c1.s86">And there's the specification for the new wing at Tusculum Lodge--you might draft that some time when you've nothing else to do.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c1.s87">You'll find all the papers on my desk.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c1.s88">Thanks awfully, old chap."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c1.p30"><s sid="89" id="brass.c1.s89">And Beevor hurried back to his own room, where for the next few minutes he could be heard bustling Harrison, the clerk, to make haste; then a hansom was whistled for, there were footsteps down the old stairs, the sounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones, and after that silence and solitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c1.p31"><s sid="90" id="brass.c1.s90">It was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious.</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c1.s91">Beevor had work to do in the world: even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan retreats by smug or pretentious villas, it was still work which entitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all right-minded persons.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c1.p32"><s sid="92" id="brass.c1.s92">And nobody believed in Horace; as yet he had never known the satisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick and mortar; no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his existence and capability long after he himself should have passed away.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c1.p33"><s sid="93" id="brass.c1.s93">It was not a profitable train of thought, and, to escape from it, he went into Beevor's room and fetched the documents he had mentioned--at least they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club and lunch.</s> <s sid="94" id="brass.c1.s94">He had no sooner settled down to his calculations, however, when he heard a shuffling step on the landing, followed by a knock at Beevor's office-door.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c1.s95">"More work for Beevor," he thought; "what luck the fellow has!</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c1.s96">I'd better go in and explain that he's just left town on business."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c1.p34"><s sid="97" id="brass.c1.s97">But on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated--this time at his own door; and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat undignified form of hide-and-seek, he discovered that this visitor at least was legitimately his, and was, in fact, no other than Professor Anthony Futvoye himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c1.p35"><s sid="98" id="brass.c1.s98">The Professor was standing in the doorway peering short-sightedly through his convex glasses, his head protruded from his loosely-fitting great-coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise.</s> <s sid="99" id="brass.c1.s99">To Horace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest client--for why should Sylvia's father take the trouble to pay him this visit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship?</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c1.s100">It might even be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c1.p36"><s sid="101" id="brass.c1.s101">So, although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind of elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of exhilaration, Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c1.p37"><s sid="102" id="brass.c1.s102">"Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this, sir," he said warmly, after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for hypothetical clients.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c1.p38"><s sid="103" id="brass.c1.s103">"Not at all.</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c1.s104">I'm afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago was somewhat of a disappointment."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c1.p39"><s sid="105" id="brass.c1.s105">"A disappointment?" echoed Horace, at a loss to know what was coming next.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c1.p40"><s sid="106" id="brass.c1.s106">"I refer to the fact--which possibly, however, escaped your notice"--explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility, "that I myself was not at home on that occasion."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c1.p41"><s sid="107" id="brass.c1.s107">"Indeed, I was greatly disappointed," said Horace, "though of course I know how much you are engaged.</s> <s sid="108" id="brass.c1.s108">It's all the more good of you to spare time to drop in for a chat just now."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c1.p42"><s sid="109" id="brass.c1.s109">"I've not come to chat, Mr. Ventimore.</s> <s sid="110" id="brass.c1.s110">I never chat.</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c1.s111">I wanted to see you about a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to---- But I observe you are busy--probably too busy to attend to such a small affair."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c1.p43"><s sid="112" id="brass.c1.s112">It was clear enough now; the Professor was going to build, and had decided--could it be at Sylvia's suggestion?--to entrust the work to him!</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c1.s113">But he contrived to subdue any self-betraying eagerness, and reply (as he could with perfect truth) that he had nothing on hand just then which he could not lay aside, and that if the Professor would let him know what he required, he would take it up at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="brass.c1.s114">"So much the better," said the Professor; "so much the better.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c1.s115">Both my wife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand upon your good nature; but, as I told them, <qs/>'I am much mistaken,'<qe/> I said, 'if Mr. Ventimore's practice is so extensive that he cannot leave it for one afternoon----'"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c1.p45"><s sid="116" id="brass.c1.s116">Evidently it was not a house.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c1.s117">Could he be needed to escort them somewhere that afternoon?</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c1.s118">Even that was more than he had hoped for a few minutes since.</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c1.s119">He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c1.p46"><s sid="120" id="brass.c1.s120">"In that case," said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his pockets--was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting?--"in that case, you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it convenient to attend a sale at Hammond's Auction Rooms in Covent Garden, and just bid for one or two articles on my behalf."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c1.p47"><s sid="121" id="brass.c1.s121">Whatever disappointment Ventimore felt, it may be said to his credit that he allowed no sign of it to appear.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c1.s122">"Of course I'll go, with pleasure," he said, "if I can be of any use."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c1.p48"><s sid="123" id="brass.c1.s123">"I knew I shouldn't come to you in vain," said the Professor.</s> <s sid="124" id="brass.c1.s124">"I remembered your wonderful good nature, sir, in accompanying my wife and daughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had at St.</s> <s sid="125" id="brass.c1.s125">Luc--when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me.</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c1.s126">Not that I should trouble you now, only I have to lunch at the Oriental Club, and I've an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a recently-discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum, which will fully occupy the rest of the afternoon, so that it's physically impossible for me to go to Hammond's myself, and I strongly object to employing a broker when I can avoid it.</s> <s sid="127" id="brass.c1.s127">Where did I put that catalogue?... Ah, here it is.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c1.s128">This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend, General Collingham, who died the other day.</s> <s sid="129" id="brass.c1.s129">I met him at Nakada when I was out excavating some years ago.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c1.s130">He was something of a collector in his way, though he knew very little about it, and, of course, was taken in right and left.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c1.s131">Most of his things are downright rubbish, but there are just a few lots that are worth securing, at a reasonable figure, by some one who knew what he was about."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c1.p49"><s sid="132" id="brass.c1.s132">"But, my dear Professor," remonstrated Horace, not relishing this responsibility, "I'm afraid I'm as likely as not to pick up some of the rubbish.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c1.s133">I've no special knowledge of Oriental curios."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c1.p50"><s sid="134" id="brass.c1.s134">"At St.</s> <s sid="135" id="brass.c1.s135">Luc," said the Professor, "you impressed me as having, for an amateur, an exceptionally accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with Egyptian and Arabian art from the earliest period."</s> <s sid="136" id="brass.c1.s136">(If this were so, Horace could only feel with shame what a fearful humbug he must have been.)</s> <s sid="137" id="brass.c1.s137">"However, I've no wish to lay too heavy a burden on you, and, as you will see from this catalogue, I have ticked off the lots in which I am chiefly interested, and made a note of the limit to which I am prepared to bid, so you'll have no difficulty."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c1.p54"><s sid="149" id="brass.c1.s149">A few minutes later Horace was driving up to Covent Garden behind the best-looking horse he could pick out.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c1.p55"><s sid="150" id="brass.c1.s150">The Professor might have required from him rather more than was strictly justified by their acquaintanceship, and taken his acquiescence too much as a matter of course--but what of that?</s> <s sid="151" id="brass.c1.s151">After all, he was Sylvia's parent.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c1.p56"><s sid="152" id="brass.c1.s152">"Even with _my_ luck," he was thinking, "I ought to succeed in getting at least one or two of the lots he's marked; and if I can only please him, something may come of it."</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER II. A CHEAP LOT</title>
<p pid="1" id="brass.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c2.s1">In spite of the fact that it was the luncheon hour when Ventimore reached Hammond's Auction Rooms, he found the big, skylighted gallery where the sale of the furniture and effects of the late General Collingham was proceeding crowded to a degree which showed that the deceased officer had some reputation as a _connoisseur_.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="brass.c2.s2">The narrow green baize tables below the auctioneer's rostrum were occupied by professional dealers, one or two of them women, who sat, paper and pencil in hand, with much the same air of apparent apathy and real vigilance that may be noticed in the Casino at Monte Carlo.</s> <s sid="3" id="brass.c2.s3">Around them stood a decorous and businesslike crowd, mostly dealers, of various types.</s> <s sid="4" id="brass.c2.s4">On a magisterial-looking bench sat the auctioneer, conducting the sale with a judicial impartiality and dignity which forbade him, even in his most laudatory comments, the faintest accent of enthusiasm.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="brass.c2.s5">The October sunshine, striking through the glazed roof, re-gilded the tarnished gas-stars, and suffused the dusty atmosphere with palest gold.</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c2.s6">But somehow the utter absence of excitement in the crowd, the calm, methodical tone of the auctioneer, and the occasional mournful cry of "Lot here, gentlemen!" from the porter when any article was too large to move, all served to depress Ventimore's usually mercurial spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c2.p4"><s sid="7" id="brass.c2.s7">For all Horace knew, the collection as a whole might be of little value, but it very soon became clear that others besides Professor Futvoye had singled out such gems as there were, also that the Professor had considerably under-rated the prices they were likely to fetch.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c2.p5"><s sid="8" id="brass.c2.s8">Ventimore made his bids with all possible discretion, but time after time he found the competition for some perforated mosque lantern, engraved ewer, or ancient porcelain tile so great that his limit was soon reached, and his sole consolation was that the article eventually changed hands for sums which were very nearly double the Professor's estimate.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c2.p6"><s sid="9" id="brass.c2.s9">Several dealers and brokers, despairing of a bargain that day, left, murmuring profanities; most of those who remained ceased to take a serious interest in the proceedings, and consoled themselves with cheap witticisms at every favourable occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c2.p7"><s sid="10" id="brass.c2.s10">The sale dragged slowly on, and, what with continual disappointment and want of food, Horace began to feel so weary that he was glad, as the crowd thinned, to get a seat at one of the green baize tables, by which time the skylights had already changed from livid grey to slate colour in the deepening dusk.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c2.p8"><s sid="11" id="brass.c2.s11">A couple of meek Burmese Buddhas had just been put up, and bore the indignity of being knocked down for nine-and-sixpence the pair with dreamy, inscrutable simpers; Horace only waited for the final lot marked by the Professor--an old Persian copper bowl, inlaid with silver and engraved round the rim with an inscription from Hafiz.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c2.p9"><s sid="12" id="brass.c2.s12">The limit to which he was authorised to go was two pounds ten; but, so desperately anxious was Ventimore not to return empty-handed, that he had made up his mind to bid an extra sovereign if necessary, and say nothing about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c2.p10"><s sid="13" id="brass.c2.s13">However, the bowl was put up, and the bidding soon rose to three pounds ten, four pounds, four pounds ten, five pounds, five guineas, for which last sum it was acquired by a bearded man on Horace's right, who immediately began to regard his purchase with a more indulgent eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c2.p11"><s sid="14" id="brass.c2.s14">Ventimore had done his best, and failed; there was no reason now why he should stay a moment longer--and yet he sat on, from sheer fatigue and disinclination to move.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c2.p12"><s sid="15" id="brass.c2.s15">"Now we come to Lot 254, gentlemen," he heard the auctioneer saying, mechanically; "a capital Egyptian mummy-case in fine con---- No, I beg pardon, I'm wrong.</s> <s sid="16" id="brass.c2.s16">This is an article which by some mistake has been omitted from the catalogue, though it ought to have been in it.</s> <s sid="17" id="brass.c2.s17">Everything on sale to-day, gentlemen, belonged to the late General Collingham.</s> <s sid="18" id="brass.c2.s18">We'll call this No. 253_a_.</s> <s sid="19" id="brass.c2.s19">Antique brass bottle.</s> <s sid="20" id="brass.c2.s20">Very curious."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c2.p13"><s sid="21" id="brass.c2.s21">One of the porters carried the bottle in between the tables, and set it down before the dealers at the farther end with a tired nonchalance.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c2.p14"><s sid="22" id="brass.c2.s22">It was an old, squat, pot-bellied vessel, about two feet high, with a long thick neck, the mouth of which was closed by a sort of metal stopper or cap; there was no visible decoration on its sides, which were rough and pitted by some incrustation that had formed on them, and been partially scraped off.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c2.s23">As a piece of _bric-a-brac_ it certainly possessed few attractions, and there was a marked tendency to "guy" it among the more frivolous brethren.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c2.p15"><s sid="24" id="brass.c2.s24">"What do you call this, sir?" inquired one of the auctioneer, with the manner of a cheeky boy trying to get a rise out of his form-master.</s> <s sid="25" id="brass.c2.s25">"Is it as 'unique' as the others?"</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c2.p16"><s sid="26" id="brass.c2.s26">"You're as well able to judge as I am," was the guarded reply.</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c2.s27">"Any one can see for himself it's not modern rubbish."</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c2.p17"><s sid="28" id="brass.c2.s28">"Make a pretty little ornament for the mantelpiece!" remarked a wag.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c2.p18"><s sid="29" id="brass.c2.s29">"Is the top made to unscrew, or what, sir?" asked a third.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c2.s30">"Seems fixed on pretty tight."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c2.p19"><s sid="31" id="brass.c2.s31">"I can't say.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c2.s32">Probably it has not been removed for some time."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c2.p20"><s sid="33" id="brass.c2.s33">"It's a goodish weight," said the chief humorist, after handling it.</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c2.s34">"What's inside of it, sir--sardines?"</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c2.p21"><s sid="35" id="brass.c2.s35">"I don't represent it as having anything inside it," said the auctioneer.</s> <s sid="36" id="brass.c2.s36">"If you want to know my opinion, I think there's money in it."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c2.p22"><s sid="37" id="brass.c2.s37">"'Ow much?"</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c2.p26"><s sid="46" id="brass.c2.s46">"Tuppence-'ap'ny!" cried the comic man, affecting to brace himself for a mighty effort.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c2.p28"><s sid="55" id="brass.c2.s55">The bottle was still being passed round with disrespectful raps and slaps, and it had now come to Ventimore's right-hand neighbour, who scrutinised it carefully, but made no bid.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c2.p29"><s sid="56" id="brass.c2.s56">"That's all _right_, you know," he whispered in Horace's ear.</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c2.s57">"That's good stuff, that is.</s> <s sid="58" id="brass.c2.s58">If I was you, I'd _'ave_ that."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c2.p30"><s sid="59" id="brass.c2.s59">"Seven shillings--eight--nine bid for it over there in the corner," said the auctioneer.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c2.p31"><s sid="60" id="brass.c2.s60">"If you think it's so good, why don't you have it yourself?"</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c2.s61">Horace asked his neighbour.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c2.p33"><s sid="67" id="brass.c2.s67">Horace rose, the better to examine the top.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c2.s68">As far as he could make out in the flickering light of one of the gas-stars, which the auctioneer had just ordered to be lit, there were half-erased scratches and triangular marks on the cap that might possibly be an inscription.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c2.s69">If so, might there not be the means here of regaining the Professor's favour, which he felt that, as it was, he should probably forfeit, justly or not, by his ill-success?</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c2.p34"><s sid="70" id="brass.c2.s70">He could hardly spend the Professor's money on it, since it was not in the catalogue, and he had no authority to bid for it, but he had a few shillings of his own to spare.</s> <s sid="71" id="brass.c2.s71">Why not bid for it on his own account as long as he could afford to do so?</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c2.s72">If he were outbid, as usual, it would not particularly matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c2.p35"><s sid="73" id="brass.c2.s73">"Thirteen shillings," the auctioneer was saying, in his dispassionate tones.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c2.s74">Horace caught his eye, and slightly raised his catalogue, while another man nodded at the same time.</s> <s sid="75" id="brass.c2.s75">"Fourteen in two places."</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c2.s76">Horace raised his catalogue again.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c2.s77">"I won't go beyond fifteen," he thought.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c2.p40"><s sid="89" id="brass.c2.s89">Horace thought another shilling or two would not ruin him, and nodded.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c2.p43"><s sid="98" id="brass.c2.s98">He paid for it, and, since he could hardly walk home nursing a large metal bottle without attracting an inconvenient amount of attention, directed that it should be sent to his lodgings at Vincent Square.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="brass.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c3.s1">Ventimore made his way to Cottesmore Gardens that evening in a highly inconsistent, not to say chaotic, state of mind.</s> <s sid="2" id="brass.c3.s2">The thought that he would presently see Sylvia again made his blood course quicker, while he was fully determined to say no more to her than civility demanded.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c3.p2"><s sid="3" id="brass.c3.s3">At one moment he was blessing Professor Futvoye for his happy thought in making use of him; at another he was bitterly recognising that it would have been better for his peace of mind if he had been left alone.</s> <s sid="4" id="brass.c3.s4">Sylvia and her mother had no desire to see more of him; if they had, they would have asked him to come before this.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c3.s5">No doubt they would tolerate him now for the Professor's sake; but who would not rather be ignored than tolerated?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c3.p3"><s sid="6" id="brass.c3.s6">The more often he saw Sylvia the more she would make his heart ache with vain longing--whereas he was getting almost reconciled to her indifference; he would very soon be cured if he didn't see her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c3.p4"><s sid="7" id="brass.c3.s7">Why _should_ he see her?</s> <s sid="8" id="brass.c3.s8">He need not go in at all.</s> <s sid="9" id="brass.c3.s9">He had merely to leave the catalogue with his compliments, and the Professor would learn all he wanted to know.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c3.p5"><s sid="10" id="brass.c3.s10">On second thoughts he must go in--if only to return the bank-note.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c3.s11">But he would ask to see the Professor in private.</s> <s sid="12" id="brass.c3.s12">Most probably he would not be invited to join his wife and daughter, but if he were, he could make some excuse.</s> <s sid="13" id="brass.c3.s13">They might think it a little odd--a little discourteous, perhaps; but they would be too relieved to care much about that.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c3.p13"><s sid="28" id="brass.c3.s28">"I'm sure I'm very glad of it," said Mrs. Futvoye, "for his study is crammed with odds and ends as it is, and I don't want the whole house to look like a museum or an antiquity shop.</s> <s sid="29" id="brass.c3.s29">I'd all the trouble in the world to persuade him that a great gaudy gilded mummy-case was not quite the thing for a drawing-room.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c3.s30">But, please sit down, Mr. Ventimore."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c3.p60"><s sid="142" id="brass.c3.s142">She was so clearly within her rights, and so much more indulgent than Horace had expected--for he had always considered her an unsentimental and rather worldly woman--that he accepted her conditions almost gratefully.</s> <s sid="143" id="brass.c3.s143">After all, it was enough for him that Sylvia returned his love, and that he should be allowed to see her from time to time.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c3.p61"><s sid="144" id="brass.c3.s144">"It's rather a pity," said Sylvia, meditatively, a little later, when her mother had gone back to her letter-writing, and she and Horace were discussing the future; "it's rather a pity that you didn't manage to get _something_ at that sale.</s> <s sid="145" id="brass.c3.s145">It might have helped you with papa."</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c3.p62"><s sid="146" id="brass.c3.s146">"Well, I did get something on my own account," he said, "though I don't know whether it is likely to do me any good with your father."</s> <s sid="147" id="brass.c3.s147">And he told her how he had come to acquire the brass bottle.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c3.p67"><s sid="160" id="brass.c3.s160">"So am I, sir," said Horace, and proceeded to give his account of the sale, which did not serve to improve the Professor's temper.</s> <s sid="161" id="brass.c3.s161">He thrust out his under lip at certain items in the catalogue.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c3.s162">"I wish I'd gone myself," he said; "that bowl, a really fine example of sixteenth-century Persian work, going for only five guineas!</s> <s sid="163" id="brass.c3.s163">I'd willingly have given ten for it.</s> <s sid="164" id="brass.c3.s164">There, there, I thought I could have depended on you to use your judgment better than that!"</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="brass.c3.p70"><s sid="168" id="brass.c3.s168">Horace had no grounds for knowing anything of the kind, and much reason for believing the contrary, but he saw no use in arguing the matter further, and merely said he was sorry to have misunderstood.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c5.p9"><s sid="22" id="brass.c5.s22">"There _was_ a vawse come late last night, sir; I don't know if it's that, it's old-fashioned enough."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c5.p10"><s sid="23" id="brass.c5.s23">"Then will you bring it up at once, please?</s> <s sid="24" id="brass.c5.s24">I want to see it."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c5.p11"><s sid="25" id="brass.c5.s25">Mrs. Rapkin retired, to reappear presently with the brass bottle.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c5.s26">"I thought you'd have noticed it when you come in last night, sir," she explained, "for I stood it in the corner, and when I see it this morning it was layin' o' one side and looking that dirty and disrespectable I took it down to give it a good clean, which it wanted it."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c5.p12"><s sid="27" id="brass.c5.s27">It certainly looked rather the better for it, and the marks or scratches on the cap were more distinguishable, but Horace was somewhat disconcerted to find that part of his dream was true--the bottle had been there.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c5.p13"><s sid="28" id="brass.c5.s28">"I hope I've done nothing wrong," said Mrs. Rapkin, observing his expression; "I only used a little warm ale to it, which is a capital thing for brass-work, and gave it a scrub with 'Vitrolia' soap--but it would take more than that to get all the muck off of it."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c5.p14"><s sid="29" id="brass.c5.s29">"It is all right, so long as you didn't try to get the top off," said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c5.p15"><s sid="30" id="brass.c5.s30">"Why, the top _was_ off it, sir.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c5.s31">I thought you'd done it with the 'ammer and chisel when you got 'ome," said his landlady, staring.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c5.s32">"I found them 'ere on the carpet."</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c5.p16"><s sid="33" id="brass.c5.s33">Horace started.</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c5.s34">Then _that_ part was true, too!</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c5.s35">"Oh, ah," he said, "I believe I did.</s> <s sid="36" id="brass.c5.s36">I'd forgotten.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c5.s37">That reminds me.</s> <s sid="38" id="brass.c5.s38">Haven't you let the room above to--to an Oriental gentleman--a native, you know--wears a green turban?"</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c5.p17"><s sid="39" id="brass.c5.s39">"That I most certainly 'ave _not_, Mr. Ventimore," said Mrs. Rapkin, with emphasis, "nor wouldn't.</s> <s sid="40" id="brass.c5.s40">Not if his turbin was all the colours of the rainbow--for I don't 'old with such.</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c5.s41">Why, there was Rapkin's own sister-in-law let her parlour floor to a Horiental--a Parsee _he_ was, or _one_ o' them Hafrican tribes--and reason she 'ad to repent of it, for all his gold spectacles!</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c5.s42">Whatever made you fancy I should let to a blackamoor?"</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c5.p18"><s sid="43" id="brass.c5.s43">"Oh, I thought I saw somebody about--er--answering that description, and I wondered if----"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c5.p19"><s sid="44" id="brass.c5.s44">"Never in _this_ 'ouse, sir.</s> <s sid="45" id="brass.c5.s45">Mrs. Steggars, next door but one, might let to such, for all I can say to the contrary, not being what you might call particular, and her rooms more suitable to savage notions--but I've enough on _my_ hands, Mr. Ventimore, attending to you--not keeping a girl to do the waiting, as why should I while I'm well able to do it better myself?"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c5.p20"><s sid="46" id="brass.c5.s46">As soon as she relieved him of her presence, he examined the bottle: there was nothing whatever inside it, which disposed of all the hopes he had entertained from that quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c5.p21"><s sid="47" id="brass.c5.s47">It was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an hallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes (for he now believed in the fumes) which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition of some long-buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the air.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c5.p22"><s sid="48" id="brass.c5.s48">If any further explanation were needed, the accidental blow to the back of his head, together with the latent suggestion from the "Arabian Nights," would amply provide it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c5.p23"><s sid="49" id="brass.c5.s49">So, having settled these points to his entire satisfaction, he went to his office in Great Cloister Street, which he now had entirely to himself, and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor on which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day before by the Professor.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c5.p24"><s sid="50" id="brass.c5.s50">The work was more or less mechanical, and could bring him no credit and little thanks, but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly whatever he undertook, and as he sat there by his wide-open window he soon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c5.p25"><s sid="51" id="brass.c5.s51">So much so that, even when the light became obscured for a moment, as if by some large and opaque body in passing, he did not look up immediately, and, when he did, was surprised to find the only armchair occupied by a portly person, who seemed to be trying to recover his breath.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c5.p26"><s sid="52" id="brass.c5.s52">"I beg your pardon," said Ventimore; "I never heard you come in."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c5.p27"><s sid="53" id="brass.c5.s53">His visitor could only wave his head in courteous deprecation, under which there seemed a suspicion of bewildered embarrassment.</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c5.s54">He was a rosy-gilled, spotlessly clean, elderly gentleman, with white whiskers; his eyes, just then slightly protuberant, were shrewd, but genial; he had a wide, jolly mouth and a double chin.</s> <s sid="55" id="brass.c5.s55">He was dressed like a man who is above disguising his prosperity; he wore a large, pear-shaped pearl in his crimson scarf, and had probably only lately discarded his summer white hat and white waistcoat.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c5.p28"><s sid="56" id="brass.c5.s56">"My dear sir," he began, in a rich, throaty voice, as soon as he could speak; "my dear sir, you must think this is a most unceremonious way of--ah!--dropping in on you--of invading your privacy."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c5.p29"><s sid="57" id="brass.c5.s57">"Not at all," said Horace, wondering whether he could possibly intend him to understand that he had come in by the window.</s> <s sid="58" id="brass.c5.s58">"I'm afraid there was no one to show you in--my clerk is away just now."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c5.p30"><s sid="59" id="brass.c5.s59">"No matter, sir, no matter.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c5.s60">I found my way up, as you perceive.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c5.s61">The important, I may say the essential, fact is that I _am_ here."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c5.p31"><s sid="62" id="brass.c5.s62">"Quite so," said Horace, "and may I ask what brought you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c5.p32"><s sid="63" id="brass.c5.s63">"What brought----" The stranger's eyes grew fish-like for the moment.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c5.s64">"Allow me, I--I shall come to that--in good time.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c5.s65">I am still a little--as you can see."</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c5.s66">He glanced round the room.</s> <s sid="67" id="brass.c5.s67">"You are, I think, an architect, Mr. ah--Mr. um----?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c5.p33"><s sid="68" id="brass.c5.s68">"Ventimore is my name," said Horace, "and I _am_ an architect."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c5.p34"><s sid="69" id="brass.c5.s69">"Ventimore, to be sure!" he put his hand in his pocket and produced a card:</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c5.s70">"Yes, it's all quite correct:</s> <s sid="71" id="brass.c5.s71">I see I have the name here.</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c5.s72">And an architect, Mr. Ventimore, so I--I am given to understand, of immense ability."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c5.p35"><s sid="73" id="brass.c5.s73">"I'm afraid I can't claim to be that," said Horace, "but I may call myself fairly competent."</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c5.p36"><s sid="74" id="brass.c5.s74">"Competent?</s> <s sid="75" id="brass.c5.s75">Why, of _course_ you're competent.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c5.s76">Do you suppose, sir, that I, a practical business man, should come to any one who was _not_ competent?" he said, with exactly the air of a man trying to convince himself--against his own judgment--that he was acting with the utmost prudence.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c5.p37"><s sid="77" id="brass.c5.s77">"Am I to understand that some one has been good enough to recommend me to you?" inquired Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c5.p38"><s sid="78" id="brass.c5.s78">"Certainly not, sir, certainly not.</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c5.s79">_I_ need no recommendation but my own judgment.</s> <s sid="80" id="brass.c5.s80">I--ah--have a tolerable acquaintance with all that is going on in the art world, and I have come to the conclusion, Mr.--eh--ah--Ventimore, I repeat, the deliberate and unassisted conclusion, that you are the one man living who can do what I want."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c5.p39"><s sid="81" id="brass.c5.s81">"Delighted to hear it," said Horace, genuinely gratified.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c5.s82">"When did you see any of my designs?"</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c5.p40"><s sid="83" id="brass.c5.s83">"Never mind, sir.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c5.s84">I don't decide without very good grounds.</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c5.s85">It doesn't take me long to make up my mind, and when my mind is made up, I act, sir, I act.</s> <s sid="86" id="brass.c5.s86">And, to come to the point, I have a small commission--unworthy, I am quite aware, of your--ah--distinguished talent--which I should like to put in your hands."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c5.p41"><s sid="87" id="brass.c5.s87">"Is _he_ going to ask me to attend a sale for him?" thought Horace.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c5.s88">"I'm hanged if I do."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c5.p42"><s sid="89" id="brass.c5.s89">"I'm rather busy at present," he said dubiously, "as you may see.</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c5.s90">I'm not sure whether----"</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c5.p43"><s sid="91" id="brass.c5.s91">"I'll put the matter in a nutshell, sir--in a nutshell.</s> <s sid="92" id="brass.c5.s92">My name is Wackerbath, Samuel Wackerbath--tolerably well known, if I may say so, in City circles."</s> <s sid="93" id="brass.c5.s93">Horace, of course, concealed the fact that his visitor's name and fame were unfamiliar to him.</s> <s sid="94" id="brass.c5.s94">"I've lately bought a few acres on the Hampshire border, near the house I'm living in just now; and I've been thinking--as I was saying to a friend only just now, as we were crossing Westminster Bridge--I've been thinking of building myself a little place there, just a humble, unpretentious home, where I could run down for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way, and perhaps live some part of the year.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c5.s95">Hitherto I've rented places as I wanted 'em--old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth: very nice in their way, but I want to feel under a roof of my own.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c5.s96">I want to surround myself with the simple comforts, the--ah--unassuming elegance of an English country home.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c5.s97">And you're the man--I feel more convinced of it with every word you say--you're the man to do the job in style--ah--to execute the work as it should be done."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c5.p44"><s sid="98" id="brass.c5.s98">Here was the long-wished-for client at last!</s> <s sid="99" id="brass.c5.s99">And it was satisfactory to feel that he had arrived in the most ordinary and commonplace course, for no one could look at Mr. Samuel Wackerbath and believe for a moment that he was capable of floating through an upper window; he was not in the least that kind of person.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c5.p45"><s sid="100" id="brass.c5.s100">"I shall be happy to do my best," said Horace, with a calmness that surprised himself.</s> <s sid="101" id="brass.c5.s101">"Could you give me some idea of the amount you are prepared to spend?"</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c5.p46"><s sid="102" id="brass.c5.s102">"Well, I'm no Croesus--though I won't say I'm a pauper precisely--and, as I remarked before, I prefer comfort to splendour.</s> <s sid="103" id="brass.c5.s103">I don't think I should be justified in going beyond--well, say sixty thousand."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c5.p47"><s sid="104" id="brass.c5.s104">"Sixty thousand!" exclaimed Horace, who had expected about a tenth of that sum.</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c5.s105">"Oh, not _more_ than sixty thousand?</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c5.s106">I see."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c5.p48"><s sid="107" id="brass.c5.s107">"I mean, on the house itself," explained Mr. Wackerbath; "there will be outbuildings, lodges, cottages, and so forth, and then some of the rooms I should want specially decorated.</s> <s sid="108" id="brass.c5.s108">Altogether, before we are finished, it may work out at about a hundred thousand.</s> <s sid="109" id="brass.c5.s109">I take it that, with such a margin, you could--ah--run me up something that in a modest way would take the shine out of--I mean to say eclipse--anything in the adjoining counties?"</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c5.p49"><s sid="110" id="brass.c5.s110">"I certainly think," said Horace, "that for such a sum as that I can undertake that you shall have a home which will satisfy you."</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c5.s111">And he proceeded to put the usual questions as to site, soil, available building materials, the accommodation that would be required, and so on.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c5.p50"><s sid="112" id="brass.c5.s112">"You're young, sir," said Mr. Wackerbath, at the end of the interview, "but I perceive you are up to all the tricks of the--I _should_ say, versed in the _minutiae_ of your profession.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c5.s113">You would like to run down and look at the ground, eh?</s> <s sid="114" id="brass.c5.s114">Well, that's only reasonable; and my wife and daughters will want to have _their_ say in the matter--no getting on without pleasing the ladies, hey?</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c5.s115">Now, let me see.</s> <s sid="116" id="brass.c5.s116">To-morrow's Sunday.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c5.s117">Why not come down by the 8.45 a.m. to Lipsfield?</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c5.s118">I'll have a trap, or a brougham and pair, or something, waiting for you--take you over the ground myself, bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court, and talk the whole thing thoroughly over.</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c5.s119">Then we'll send you up to town in the evening, and you can start work the first thing on Monday.</s> <s sid="120" id="brass.c5.s120">That suit you?</s> <s sid="121" id="brass.c5.s121">Very well, then.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c5.s122">We'll expect you to-morrow."</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c5.p51"><s sid="123" id="brass.c5.s123">With this Mr. Wackerbath departed, leaving Horace, as may be imagined, absolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good fortune.</s> <s sid="124" id="brass.c5.s124">He was no longer one of the unemployed: he had work to do, and, better still, work that would interest him, give him all the scope and opportunity he could wish for.</s> <s sid="125" id="brass.c5.s125">With a client who seemed tractable, and to whom money was clearly no object, he might carry out some of his most ambitious ideas.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c5.p52"><s sid="126" id="brass.c5.s126">Moreover, he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia's father without fear of a repulse.</s> <s sid="127" id="brass.c5.s127">His commission on PS60,000 would be PS3,000, and that on the decorations and other work at least as much again--probably more.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c5.s128">In a year he could marry without imprudence; in two or three years he might be making a handsome income, for he felt confident that, with such a start, he would soon have as much work as he could undertake.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c5.p53"><s sid="129" id="brass.c5.s129">He was ashamed of himself for ever having lost heart.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c5.s130">What were the last few years of weary waiting but probation and preparation for this splendid chance, which had come just when he really needed it, and in the most simple and natural manner?</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c5.p54"><s sid="131" id="brass.c5.s131">He loyally completed the work he had promised to do for Beevor, who would have to dispense with his assistance in future, and then he felt too excited and restless to stay in the office, and, after lunching at his club as usual, he promised himself the pleasure of going to Cottesmore Gardens and telling Sylvia his good news.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c5.p55"><s sid="132" id="brass.c5.s132">It was still early, and he walked the whole way, as some vent for his high spirits, enjoying everything with a new zest--the dappled grey and salmon sky before him, the amber, russet, and yellow of the scanty foliage in Kensington Gardens, the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and acorns and burning leaves, the blue-grey mist stealing between the distant tree-trunks, and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the High Street.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c5.s133">Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone, and witnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her, of feeling her hands on his shoulders, and holding her in his arms, as their lips met for the first time.</s> <s sid="134" id="brass.c5.s134">If on that Saturday afternoon there was a happier man than Horace Ventimore, he would have done well to dissemble his felicity, for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c5.p56"><s sid="135" id="brass.c5.s135">When Mrs. Futvoye returned, as she did only too soon, to find her daughter and Horace seated on the same sofa, she did not pretend to be gratified.</s> <s sid="136" id="brass.c5.s136">"This is taking a most unfair advantage of what I was weak enough to say last night, Mr. Ventimore," she began.</s> <s sid="137" id="brass.c5.s137">"I thought I could have trusted you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c5.p57"><s sid="138" id="brass.c5.s138">"I shouldn't have come so soon," he said, "if my position were what it was only yesterday.</s> <s sid="139" id="brass.c5.s139">But it's changed since then, and I venture to hope that even the Professor won't object now to our being regularly engaged."</s> <s sid="140" id="brass.c5.s140">And he told her of the sudden alteration in his prospects.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c5.p58"><s sid="141" id="brass.c5.s141">"Well," said Mrs. Futvoye, "you had better speak to my husband about it."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c5.p59"><s sid="142" id="brass.c5.s142">The Professor came in shortly afterwards, and Horace immediately requested a few minutes' conversation with him in the study, which was readily granted.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c5.p60"><s sid="143" id="brass.c5.s143">The study to which the Professor led the way was built out at the back of the house, and crowded with Oriental curios of every age and kind; the furniture had been made by Cairene cabinet-makers, and along the cornices of the book-cases were texts from the Koran, while every chair bore the Arabic for "Welcome" in a gilded firework on its leather back; the lamp was a perforated mosque lantern with long pendent glass tubes like hyacinth glasses; a mummy-case smiled from a corner with laboured _bonhomie_.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c5.p61"><s sid="144" id="brass.c5.s144">"Well," began the Professor, as soon as they were seated, "so I was not mistaken--there was something in the brass bottle after all, then?</s> <s sid="145" id="brass.c5.s145">Let's have a look at it, whatever it is."</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c5.p62"><s sid="146" id="brass.c5.s146">For the moment Horace had almost forgotten the bottle.</s> <s sid="147" id="brass.c5.s147">"Oh!" he said, "I--I got it open; but there was nothing in it."</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c5.p63"><s sid="148" id="brass.c5.s148">"Just as I anticipated, sir," said the Professor.</s> <s sid="149" id="brass.c5.s149">"I told you there couldn't be anything in a bottle of that description; it was simply throwing money away to buy it."</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c5.p64"><s sid="150" id="brass.c5.s150">"I dare say it was, but I wished to speak to you on a much more important matter;" and Horace briefly explained his object.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c5.p65"><s sid="151" id="brass.c5.s151">"Dear me," said the Professor, rubbing up his hair irritably, "dear me!</s> <s sid="152" id="brass.c5.s152">I'd no idea of this--no idea at all.</s> <s sid="153" id="brass.c5.s153">I was under the impression that you volunteered to act as escort to my wife and daughter at St.</s> <s sid="154" id="brass.c5.s154">Luc purely out of good nature to relieve me from what--to a man of my habits in that extreme heat--would have been an arduous and distasteful duty."</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c5.p66"><s sid="155" id="brass.c5.s155">"I was not wholly unselfish, I admit," said Horace.</s> <s sid="156" id="brass.c5.s156">"I fell in love with your daughter, sir, the first day I met her--only I felt I had no right, as a poor man with no prospects, to speak to her or you at that time."</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c5.p67"><s sid="157" id="brass.c5.s157">"A very creditable feeling--but I've yet to learn why you should have overcome it."</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c5.p68"><s sid="158" id="brass.c5.s158">So, for the third time, Ventimore told the story of the sudden turn in his fortunes.</s> </p>

<p pid="95" id="brass.c5.p95"><s sid="222" id="brass.c5.s222">"I quite understand, sir," said Horace, good-temperedly; "it would be foolish of me to attempt any ambitious form of entertainment--especially as my landlady, though an excellent plain cook, is not exactly a _cordon bleu_.</s> <s sid="223" id="brass.c5.s223">So you can come to my modest board without misgivings."</s> </p>

<p pid="96" id="brass.c5.p96"><s sid="224" id="brass.c5.s224">Before he left, a provisional date for the dinner was fixed for an evening towards the end of the next week, and Horace walked home, treading on air rather than hard paving-stones, and "striking the stars with his uplifted head."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c6.p38"><s sid="86" id="brass.c6.s86">Horace next asked himself whether he was bound in honour to disclose the facts to Mr. Wackerbath, and give him the opportunity of withdrawing from the agreement if he thought fit.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c6.p39"><s sid="87" id="brass.c6.s87">On the whole, he saw no necessity for telling him anything; the only possible result would be to make his client suspect his sanity; and who would care to employ an insane architect?</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c6.s88">Then, if he retired from the undertaking without any explanations, what could he say to Sylvia?</s> <s sid="89" id="brass.c6.s89">What would Sylvia's father say to _him_?</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c6.s90">There would certainly be an end to his engagement.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c6.p40"><s sid="91" id="brass.c6.s91">After all, he had not been to blame; the Wackerbaths were quite satisfied.</s> <s sid="92" id="brass.c6.s92">He felt perfectly sure that he could justify their selection of him; he would wrong nobody by accepting the commission, while he would only offend them, injure himself irretrievably, and lose all hope of gaining Sylvia if he made any attempt to undeceive them.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c6.p41"><s sid="93" id="brass.c6.s93">And Fakrash was gone, never to return.</s> <s sid="94" id="brass.c6.s94">So, on all these considerations, Horace decided that silence was his only possible policy, and, though some moralists may condemn his conduct as disingenuous and wanting in true moral courage, I venture to doubt whether any reader, however independent, straightforward, and indifferent to notoriety and ridicule, would have behaved otherwise in Ventimore's extremely delicate and difficult position.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c6.p42"><s sid="95" id="brass.c6.s95">Some days passed, every working hour of which was spent by Horace in the rapture of creation.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c6.s96">To every man with the soul of an artist in him there comes at times--only too seldom in most cases--a revelation of latent power that he had not dared to hope for.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c6.s97">And now with Ventimore years of study and theorising which he had often been tempted to think wasted began to bear golden fruit.</s> <s sid="98" id="brass.c6.s98">He designed and drew with a rapidity and originality, a sense of perfect mastery of the various problems to be dealt with, and a delight in the working out of mass and detail, so intoxicating that he almost dreaded lest he should be the victim of some self-delusion.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c6.p43"><s sid="99" id="brass.c6.s99">His evenings were of course spent with the Futvoyes, in discovering Sylvia in some new and yet more adorable aspect.</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c6.s100">Altogether, he was very much in love, very happy, and very busy--three states not invariably found in combination.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c6.p44"><s sid="101" id="brass.c6.s101">And, as he had foreseen, he had effectually got rid of Fakrash, who was evidently too engrossed in the pursuit of Solomon to think of anything else.</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c6.s102">And there seemed no reason why he should abandon his search for a generation or two, for it would probably take all that time to convince him that that mighty monarch was no longer on the throne.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c6.p45"><s sid="103" id="brass.c6.s103">"It would have been too brutal to tell him myself," thought Horace, "when he was so keen on having his case reheard.</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c6.s104">And it gives him an object, poor old buffer, and keeps him from interfering in my affairs, so it's best for both of us."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c6.p46"><s sid="105" id="brass.c6.s105">Horace's little dinner-party had been twice postponed, till he had begun to have a superstitious fear that it would never come off; but at length the Professor had been induced to give an absolute promise for a certain evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c6.p48"><s sid="109" id="brass.c6.s109">"I suppose, sir, you would require Rapkin to wait?"</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c6.p49"><s sid="110" id="brass.c6.s110">As the ex-butler was liable to trances on these occasions during which he could do nothing but smile and bow with speechless politeness as he dropped sauce-boats and plates, Horace replied that he thought of having someone in to avoid troubling Mr. Rapkin; but his wife expressed such confidence in her husband's proving equal to all emergencies, that Ventimore waived the point, and left it to her to hire extra help if she thought fit.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c6.p50"><s sid="111" id="brass.c6.s111">"Now, what soup can you give us?" he inquired, as Mrs. Rapkin stood at attention and quite unmollified.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c6.p51"><s sid="112" id="brass.c6.s112">After protracted mental conflict, she grudgingly suggested gravy soup--which Horace thought too unenterprising, and rejected in favour of mock turtle.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c6.s113">"Well then, fish?" he continued; "how about fish?"</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c6.p52"><s sid="114" id="brass.c6.s114">Mrs. Rapkin dragged the depths of her culinary resources for several seconds, and finally brought to the surface what she called "a nice fried sole."</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c6.s115">Horace would not hear of it, and urged her to aspire to salmon; she substituted smelts, which he opposed by a happy inspiration of turbot and lobster sauce.</s> <s sid="116" id="brass.c6.s116">The sauce, however, presented insuperable difficulties to her mind, and she offered a compromise in the form of cod--which he finally accepted as a fish which the Professor could hardly censure for ostentation.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c6.p53"><s sid="117" id="brass.c6.s117">Next came the no less difficult questions of _entree_ or no _entree_, of joint and bird.</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c6.s118">"What's in season just now?" said Horace; "let me see"--and glanced out of the window as he spoke, as though in search of some outside suggestion....

<p pid="54" id="brass.c6.p54"><s sid="119" id="brass.c6.s119">"_Camels_, Mr. Ventimore, sir?" repeated Mrs. Rapkin, in some bewilderment; and then, remembering that he was given to untimely flippancy, she gave a tolerant little cough.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c6.p55"><s sid="120" id="brass.c6.s120">"I'll be shot if they _aren't_ camels!" said Horace.</s> <s sid="121" id="brass.c6.s121">"What do _you_ make of 'em, Mrs. Rapkin?"</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c6.p56"><s sid="122" id="brass.c6.s122">Out of the faint mist which hung over the farther end of the square advanced a procession of tall, dust-coloured animals, with long, delicately poised necks and a mincing gait.</s> <s sid="123" id="brass.c6.s123">Even Mrs. Rapkin could not succeed in making anything of them except camels.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c6.p57"><s sid="124" id="brass.c6.s124">"What the deuce does a caravan of camels want in Vincent Square?" said Horace, with a sudden qualm for which he could not account.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c6.p58"><s sid="125" id="brass.c6.s125">"Most likely they belong to the Barnum Show, sir," suggested his landlady.</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c6.s126">"I did hear they were coming to Olympia again this year."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c6.p59"><s sid="127" id="brass.c6.s127">"Why, of course," cried Horace, intensely relieved.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c6.s128">"It's on their way from the Docks--at least, it isn't _out_ of their way.</s> <s sid="129" id="brass.c6.s129">Or probably the main road's up for repairs.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c6.s130">That's it--they'll turn off to the left at the corner.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c6.s131">See, they've got Arab drivers with them.</s> <s sid="132" id="brass.c6.s132">Wonderful how the fellows manage them."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c6.p60"><s sid="133" id="brass.c6.s133">"It seems to me, sir," said Mrs. Rapkin, "that they're coming _our_ way--they seem to be stopping outside."</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c6.p61"><s sid="134" id="brass.c6.s134">"Don't talk such infernal---- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Rapkin; but why on earth should Barnum and Bailey's camels come out of their way to call on _me_?</s> <s sid="135" id="brass.c6.s135">It's ridiculous, you know!" said Horace, irritably.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c6.p62"><s sid="136" id="brass.c6.s136">"Ridicklous it _may_ be, sir," she retorted, "but they're all layin' down on the road opposite our door, as you can see--and them niggers is making signs to you to come out and speak to 'em."</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c6.p63"><s sid="137" id="brass.c6.s137">It was true enough.</s> <s sid="138" id="brass.c6.s138">One by one the camels, which were apparently of the purest breed, folded themselves up in a row like campstools at a sign from their attendants, who were now making profound salaams towards the window where Ventimore was standing.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c6.p64"><s sid="139" id="brass.c6.s139">"I suppose I'd better go down and see what they want," he said, with rather a sickly smile.</s> <s sid="140" id="brass.c6.s140">"They may have lost the way to Olympia.... I only hope Fakrash isn't at the bottom of this," he thought, as he went downstairs.</s> <s sid="141" id="brass.c6.s141">"But he'd come himself--at all events, he wouldn't send me a message on such a lot of camels!"</s> <s sid="142" id="brass.c6.s142">As he appeared on the doorstep, all the drivers flopped down and rubbed their flat, black noses on the curbstone.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c6.p65"><s sid="143" id="brass.c6.s143">"For Heaven's sake get up!" said Horace angrily.</s> <s sid="144" id="brass.c6.s144">"This isn't Hammersmith.</s> <s sid="145" id="brass.c6.s145">Turn to the left, into the Vauxhall Bridge Road, and ask a policeman the nearest way to Olympia."</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c6.p66"><s sid="146" id="brass.c6.s146">"Be not angry with thy slaves!" said the head driver, in excellent English.</s> <s sid="147" id="brass.c6.s147">"We are here by command of Fakrash-el-Aamash, our lord, whom we are bound to obey.</s> <s sid="148" id="brass.c6.s148">And we have brought thee these as gifts."</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c6.p67"><s sid="149" id="brass.c6.s149">"My compliments to your master," said Horace, between his teeth, "and tell him that a London architect has no sort of occasion for camels.</s> <s sid="150" id="brass.c6.s150">Say that I am extremely obliged--but am compelled to decline them."</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c6.p68"><s sid="151" id="brass.c6.s151">"O highly born one," explained the driver, "the camels are not a gift--but the loads which are upon the camels.</s> <s sid="152" id="brass.c6.s152">Suffer us, therefore, since we dare not disobey our lord's commands, to carry these trifling tokens of his good will into thy dwelling and depart in peace."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c6.p69"><s sid="153" id="brass.c6.s153">Horace had not noticed till then that every camel bore a heavy burden, which the attendants were now unloading.</s> <s sid="154" id="brass.c6.s154">"Oh, if you _must_!" he said, not too graciously; "only do look sharp about it--there's a crowd collecting already, and I don't want to have a constable here."</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="brass.c6.p70"><s sid="155" id="brass.c6.s155">He returned to his rooms, where he found Mrs. Rapkin paralysed with amazement.</s> <s sid="156" id="brass.c6.s156">"It's--it's all right," he said; "I'd forgotten--it's only a few Oriental things from the place where that brass bottle came from, you know.</s> <s sid="157" id="brass.c6.s157">They've left them here--on approval."</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="brass.c6.p71"><s sid="158" id="brass.c6.s158">"Seems funny their sending their goods 'ome on camels, sir, doesn't it?" said Mrs. Rapkin.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="brass.c6.p72"><s sid="159" id="brass.c6.s159">"Not at all funny!" said Horace; "they--they're an enterprising firm--their way of advertising."</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="brass.c6.p73"><s sid="160" id="brass.c6.s160">One after another, a train of dusky attendants entered, each of whom deposited his load on the floor with a guttural grunt and returned backward, until the sitting-room was blocked with piles of sacks, and bales, and chests, whereupon the head driver appeared and intimated that the tale of gifts was complete.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="brass.c6.p74"><s sid="161" id="brass.c6.s161">"I wonder what sort of tip this fellow expects," thought Horace; "a sovereign seems shabby--but it's all I can run to.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c6.s162">I'll try him with that."</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c6.p75"><s sid="163" id="brass.c6.s163">But the overseer repudiated all idea of a gratuity with stately dignity, and as Horace saw him to the gate, he found a stolid constable by the railings.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="brass.c6.p76"><s sid="164" id="brass.c6.s164">"This won't _do_, you know," said the constable; "these 'ere camels must move on--or I shall 'ave to interfere."</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="brass.c6.p77"><s sid="165" id="brass.c6.s165">"It's all right, constable," said Horace, pressing into his hand the sovereign the head driver had rejected; "they're going to move on now.</s> <s sid="166" id="brass.c6.s166">They've brought me a few presents from--from a friend of mine in the East."</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="brass.c6.p78"><s sid="167" id="brass.c6.s167">By this time the attendants had mounted the kneeling camels, which rose with them, and swung off round the square in a long, swaying trot that soon left the crowd far behind, staring blankly after the caravan as camel after camel disappeared into the haze.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="brass.c6.p79"><s sid="168" id="brass.c6.s168">"I shouldn't mind knowin' that friend o' yours, sir," said the constable; "open-hearted sort o' gentleman, I should think?"</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="brass.c6.p80"><s sid="169" id="brass.c6.s169">"Very!" said Horace, savagely, and returned to his room, which Mrs. Rapkin had now left.</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="brass.c6.p81"><s sid="170" id="brass.c6.s170">His hands shook, though not with joy, as he untied some of the sacks and bales and forced open the outlandish-looking chests, the contents of which almost took away his breath.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="brass.c6.p82"><s sid="171" id="brass.c6.s171">For in the bales were carpets and tissues which he saw at a glance must be of fabulous antiquity and beyond all price; the sacks held golden ewers and vessels of strange workmanship and pantomimic proportions; the chests were full of jewels--ropes of creamy-pink pearls as large as average onions, strings of uncut rubies and emeralds, the smallest of which would have been a tight fit in an ordinary collar-box, and diamonds, roughly facetted and polished, each the size of a coconut, in whose hearts quivered a liquid and prismatic radiance.</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="brass.c6.p83"><s sid="172" id="brass.c6.s172">On the most moderate computation, the total value of these gifts could hardly be less than several hundred millions; never probably in the world's history had any treasury contained so rich a store.</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="brass.c6.p84"><s sid="173" id="brass.c6.s173">It would have been difficult for anybody, on suddenly finding himself the possessor of this immense incalculable wealth, to make any comment quite worthy of the situation, but, surely, none could have been more inadequate and indeed inappropriate than Horace's--which, heartfelt as it was, was couched in the simple monosyllable--"Damn!"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c7.p22"><s sid="55" id="brass.c7.s55">"Well, sir, bargain or none, I wouldn't have 'em as a gift myself, being so dirty and fusty; they can't be no use to anybody, not to mention there being no room to move with them blocking up all the place.</s> <s sid="56" id="brass.c7.s56">I'd better tell Rapkin to carry 'em all upstairs out of people's way."</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c7.p23"><s sid="57" id="brass.c7.s57">"Certainly not," said Horace, sharply, by no means anxious for the Rapkins to discover the real nature of his treasures.</s> <s sid="58" id="brass.c7.s58">"Don't touch them, either of you.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c7.s59">Leave them exactly as they are, do you understand?"</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c7.p40"><s sid="87" id="brass.c7.s87">"I know," said Horace; "but--you won't be offended if I speak quite plainly?"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c7.p45"><s sid="95" id="brass.c7.s95">"This is not the reasoning of an intelligent person," said the Jinnee, coldly.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c7.p47"><s sid="99" id="brass.c7.s99">"So thou wouldst have me break the oath which I swore to reward thee fitly for thy kind action?"</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c7.p48"><s sid="100" id="brass.c7.s100">"But you _have_ rewarded me already," said Horace, "by contriving that a wealthy merchant should engage me to build him a residence.</s> <s sid="101" id="brass.c7.s101">And--forgive my plain speaking--if you truly desire my happiness (as I am sure you do) you will relieve me of all these precious gems and merchandise, because, to be frank, they will _not_ make me happy.</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c7.s102">On the contrary, they are making me extremely uncomfortable."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c7.p49"><s sid="103" id="brass.c7.s103">"In the days of old," said Fakrash, "all men pursued wealth; nor could any amass enough to satisfy his desires.</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c7.s104">Have riches, then, become so contemptible in mortal eyes that thou findest them but an encumbrance?</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c7.s105">Explain the matter."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c7.p50"><s sid="106" id="brass.c7.s106">Horace felt a natural delicacy in giving his real reasons.</s> <s sid="107" id="brass.c7.s107">"I can't answer for other men," he said.</s> <s sid="108" id="brass.c7.s108">"All I know is that I've never been accustomed to being rich, and I'd rather get used to it gradually, and be able to feel that I owed it, as far as possible, to my own exertions.</s> <s sid="109" id="brass.c7.s109">For, as I needn't tell _you_, Mr. Fakrash, riches alone don't make any fellow happy.</s> <s sid="110" id="brass.c7.s110">You must have observed that they're apt to--well, to land him in all kinds of messes and worries....

<p pid="51" id="brass.c7.p51"><s sid="111" id="brass.c7.s111">Fakrash was deeply impressed.</s> <s sid="112" id="brass.c7.s112">"O young man of marvellous moderation!" he cried.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c7.s113">"Thy sentiments are not inferior to those of the Great Suleyman himself (on whom be peace!).</s> <s sid="114" id="brass.c7.s114">Yet even he doth not utterly despise them, for he hath gold and ivory and precious stones in abundance.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c7.s115">Nor hitherto have I ever met a human being capable of rejecting them when offered.</s> <s sid="116" id="brass.c7.s116">But, since thou seemest sincere in holding that my poor and paltry gifts will not advance thy welfare, and since I would do thee good and not evil--be it even as thou wouldst.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c7.s117">For excellently was it said:</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c7.s118">'The worth of a present depends not on itself, nor on the giver, but on the receiver alone.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c7.p53"><s sid="123" id="brass.c7.s123">"It will be the easiest of actions," replied Fakrash; "therefore, have no fear that, when the time cometh, thou wilt not be able to entertain thy friends in a fitting manner.</s> <s sid="124" id="brass.c7.s124">And for the caravan, it shall set out without delay."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c7.p54"><s sid="125" id="brass.c7.s125">"By Jove, though, I'd forgotten one thing," said Horace:</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c7.s126">"I've locked up the room where your presents are--they won't be able to get in without the key."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c7.p57"><s sid="132" id="brass.c7.s132">"On my arrival," said Fakrash, "I heard thee lamenting the difficulties of the task; wherein do they consist?"</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c7.p58"><s sid="133" id="brass.c7.s133">"Oh," said Horace, "it's a little difficult to please all the different people concerned, and myself too.</s> <s sid="134" id="brass.c7.s134">I want to make something of it that I shall be proud of, and that will give me a reputation.</s> <s sid="135" id="brass.c7.s135">It's a large house, and there will be a good deal of work in it; but I shall manage it all right."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c7.p59"><s sid="136" id="brass.c7.s136">"This is a great undertaking indeed," remarked the Jinnee, after he had asked various by no means unintelligent questions and received the answers.</s> <s sid="137" id="brass.c7.s137">"But be persuaded that it shall all turn out most fortunately and thou shalt obtain great renown.</s> <s sid="138" id="brass.c7.s138">And now," he concluded, "I am compelled to take leave of thee, for I am still without any certain tidings of Suleyman."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c7.p60"><s sid="139" id="brass.c7.s139">"You mustn't let me keep you," said Horace, who had been on thorns for some minutes lest Beevor should return and find him with his mysterious visitor.</s> <s sid="140" id="brass.c7.s140">"You see," he added instructively, "so long as you _will_ neglect your own much more important affairs to look after mine, you can hardly expect to make _much_ progress, can you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c7.p61"><s sid="141" id="brass.c7.s141">"How excellent is the saying," replied the Jinnee:</s> <s sid="142" id="brass.c7.s142">"'The time which is spent in doing kindnesses, call it not wasted.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c7.p62"><s sid="143" id="brass.c7.s143">"Yes, that's very good," said Horace, feeling driven to silence this maxim, if possible, with one of his own invention.</s> <s sid="144" id="brass.c7.s144">"But _we_ have a saying too--how does it go?</s> <s sid="145" id="brass.c7.s145">Ah, I remember.</s> <s sid="146" id="brass.c7.s146">'It is possible for a kindness to be more inconvenient than an injury.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c7.p63"><s sid="147" id="brass.c7.s147">"Marvellously gifted was he who discovered such a saying!" cried Fakrash.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c7.p64"><s sid="148" id="brass.c7.s148">"I imagine," said Horace, "he learnt it from his own experience.</s> <s sid="149" id="brass.c7.s149">By the way, what place were you thinking of drawing--I mean trying--next for Suleyman?"</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c7.p65"><s sid="150" id="brass.c7.s150">"I purpose to repair to Nineveh, and inquire there."</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c7.p66"><s sid="151" id="brass.c7.s151">"Capital," said Ventimore, with hearty approval, for he hoped that this would take the Jinnee some little time.</s> <s sid="152" id="brass.c7.s152">"Wonderful city, Nineveh, from all I've heard--though not quite what it used to be, perhaps.</s> <s sid="153" id="brass.c7.s153">Then there's Babylon--you might go on there.</s> <s sid="154" id="brass.c7.s154">And if you shouldn't hear of him there, why not strike down into Central Africa, and do that thoroughly?</s> <s sid="155" id="brass.c7.s155">Or South America; it's a pity to lose any chance--you've never been to South America yet?"</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c7.p67"><s sid="156" id="brass.c7.s156">"I have not so much as heard of such a country, and how should Suleyman be there?"</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c7.p68"><s sid="157" id="brass.c7.s157">"Pardon me, I didn't say he _was_ there.</s> <s sid="158" id="brass.c7.s158">All I meant to convey was, that he's quite as likely to be there as anywhere else.</s> <s sid="159" id="brass.c7.s159">But if you're going to Nineveh first, you'd better lose no more time, for I've always understood that it's rather an awkward place to get at--though probably _you_ won't find it very difficult."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c7.p69"><s sid="160" id="brass.c7.s160">"I care not," said Fakrash, "though the search be long, for in travel there are five advantages----"</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="brass.c7.p70"><s sid="161" id="brass.c7.s161">"I know," interrupted Horace, "so don't stop to describe them now.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c7.s162">I should like to see you fairly started, and you really mustn't think it necessary to break off your search again on my account, because, thanks to you, I shall get on splendidly alone for the future--if you'll kindly see that that merchandise is removed."</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="brass.c7.p71"><s sid="163" id="brass.c7.s163">"Thine abode shall not be encumbered with it for another hour," said the Jinnee.</s> <s sid="164" id="brass.c7.s164">"O thou judicious one, in whose estimation wealth is of no value, know that I have never encountered a mortal who pleased me as thou hast; and moreover, be assured that such magnanimity as thine shall not go without a recompense!"</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="brass.c7.p72"><s sid="165" id="brass.c7.s165">"How often must I tell you," said Horace, in a glow of impatience, "that I am already much more than recompensed?</s> <s sid="166" id="brass.c7.s166">Now, my kind, generous old friend," he added, with an emotion that was not wholly insincere, "the time has come to bid you farewell--for ever.</s> <s sid="167" id="brass.c7.s167">Let me picture you as revisiting your former haunts, penetrating to quarters of the globe (for, whether you are aware of it or not, this earth of ours _is_ a globe) hitherto unknown to you, refreshing your mind by foreign travel and the study of mankind--but never, never for a moment losing sight of your main object, the eventual discovery of and reconciliation with Suleyman (on whom be peace!).</s> <s sid="168" id="brass.c7.s168">That is the greatest, the only happiness you can give me now.</s> <s sid="169" id="brass.c7.s169">Good-bye, and _bon voyage_!"</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="brass.c7.p73"><s sid="170" id="brass.c7.s170">"May Allah never deprive thy friends of thy presence!" returned the Jinnee, who was apparently touched by this exordium, "for truly thou art a most excellent young man!"</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c7.p75"><s sid="172" id="brass.c7.s172">Ventimore sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief.</s> <s sid="173" id="brass.c7.s173">He had begun to fear that the Jinnee never would take himself off, but he had gone at last--and for good.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="brass.c7.p76"><s sid="174" id="brass.c7.s174">He was half ashamed of himself for feeling so glad, for Fakrash was a good-natured old thing enough in his way.</s> <s sid="175" id="brass.c7.s175">Only he _would_ overdo things: he had no sense of proportion.</s> <s sid="176" id="brass.c7.s176">"Why," thought Horace, "if a fellow expressed a modest wish for a canary in a cage he's just the sort of old Jinnee to bring him a whole covey of rocs in an aviary about ten times the size of the Crystal Palace.</s> <s sid="177" id="brass.c7.s177">However, he _does_ understand now that I can't take anything more from him, and he isn't offended either, so _that's_ all settled.</s> <s sid="178" id="brass.c7.s178">Now I can set to work and knock off these plans in peace and quietness."</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="brass.c7.p77"><s sid="179" id="brass.c7.s179">But he had not done much before he heard sounds in the next room which told him that Beevor had returned at last.</s> <s sid="180" id="brass.c7.s180">He had been expected back from the country for the last day or two, and it was fortunate that he had delayed so long, thought Ventimore, as he went in to see him and to tell him the unexpected piece of good fortune that he himself had met with since they last met.</s> <s sid="181" id="brass.c7.s181">It is needless to say that, in giving his account, he abstained from any mention of the brass bottle or the Jinnee, as unessential elements in his story.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="brass.c7.p82"><s sid="198" id="brass.c7.s198">"I should rather like to see what you've made of it.</s> <s sid="199" id="brass.c7.s199">I might be able to give you a wrinkle here and there."</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="brass.c7.p83"><s sid="200" id="brass.c7.s200">"It's awfully good of you, but I think I'd rather you didn't see the plans till they're quite finished," said Horace.</s> <s sid="201" id="brass.c7.s201">The truth was that he was perfectly aware that the other would not be in sympathy with his ideas; and Horace, who had just been suffering from a cold fit of depression about his work, rather shrank from any kind of criticism.</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="brass.c7.p84"><s sid="202" id="brass.c7.s202">"Oh, just as you please!" said Beevor, a little stiffly; "you always _were_ an obstinate beggar.</s> <s sid="203" id="brass.c7.s203">I've had a certain amount of experience, you know, in my poor little pottering way, and I thought I might possibly have saved you a cropper or two.</s> <s sid="204" id="brass.c7.s204">But if you think you can manage better alone--only don't get bolted with by one of those architectural hobbies of yours, that's all."</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="brass.c7.p85"><s sid="205" id="brass.c7.s205">"All right, old fellow.</s> <s sid="206" id="brass.c7.s206">I'll ride my hobby on the curb," said Horace, laughing, as he went back to his own office, where he found that all his former certainty and enjoyment of his work had returned to him, and by the end of the day he had made so much progress that his designs needed only a few finishing touches to be complete enough for his client's inspection.</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="brass.c7.p86"><s sid="207" id="brass.c7.s207">Better still, on returning to his rooms that evening to change before going to Kensington, he found that the admirable Fakrash had kept his promise--every chest, sack, and bale had been cleared away.</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="brass.c7.p87"><s sid="208" id="brass.c7.s208">"Them camels come back for the things this afternoon, sir," said Mrs. Rapkin, "and it put me in a fluster at first, for I made sure you'd locked your door and took the key.</s> <s sid="209" id="brass.c7.s209">But I must have been mistook--leastways, them Arabs got in somehow.</s> <s sid="210" id="brass.c7.s210">I hope you meant everything to go back?"</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="brass.c7.p88"><s sid="211" id="brass.c7.s211">"Quite," said Horace; "I saw the--the person who sent them this morning, and told him there was nothing I cared for enough to keep."</s> </p>

<p pid="89" id="brass.c7.p89"><s sid="212" id="brass.c7.s212">"And like his impidence sending you a lot o' rubbish like that on approval--and on camels, too!" declared Mrs. Rapkin.</s> <s sid="213" id="brass.c7.s213">"I'm sure I don't know what them advertising firms will try next--pushing, _I_ call it."</s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="brass.c7.p90"><s sid="214" id="brass.c7.s214">Now that everything was gone, Horace felt a little natural regret and doubt whether he need have been quite so uncompromising in his refusal of the treasures.</s> <s sid="215" id="brass.c7.s215">"I might have kept some of those tissues and things for Sylvia," he thought; "and she loves pearls.</s> <s sid="216" id="brass.c7.s216">And a prayer-carpet would have pleased the Professor tremendously.</s> <s sid="217" id="brass.c7.s217">But no, after all, it wouldn't have done.</s> <s sid="218" id="brass.c7.s218">Sylvia couldn't go about in pearls the size of new potatoes, and the Professor would only have ragged me for more reckless extravagance.</s> <s sid="219" id="brass.c7.s219">Besides, if I'd taken any of the Jinnee's gifts, he might keep on pouring more in, till I should be just where I was before--or worse off, really, because I couldn't decently refuse them, then.</s> <s sid="220" id="brass.c7.s220">So it's best as it is."</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="brass.c7.p91"><s sid="221" id="brass.c7.s221">And really, considering his temperament and the peculiar nature of his position, it is not easy to see how he could have arrived at any other conclusion.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER VIII. BACHELOR'S QUARTERS</title>
<p pid="1" id="brass.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c8.s1">Horace was feeling particularly happy as he walked back the next evening to Vincent Square.</s> <s sid="2" id="brass.c8.s2">He had the consciousness of having done a good day's work, for the sketch-plans for Mr. Wackerbath's mansion were actually completed and despatched to his business address, while Ventimore now felt a comfortable assurance that his designs would more than satisfy his client.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c8.p2"><s sid="3" id="brass.c8.s3">But it was not that which made him so light of heart.</s> <s sid="4" id="brass.c8.s4">That night his rooms were to be honoured for the first time by Sylvia's presence.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c8.s5">She would tread upon his carpet, sit in his chairs, comment upon, and perhaps even handle, his books and ornaments--and all of them would retain something of her charm for ever after.</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c8.s6">If she only came!</s> <s sid="7" id="brass.c8.s7">For even now he could not quite believe that she really would; that some untoward event would not make a point of happening to prevent her, as he sometimes doubted whether his engagement was not too sweet and wonderful to be true--or, at all events, to last.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c8.p3"><s sid="8" id="brass.c8.s8">As to the dinner, his mind was tolerably easy, for he had settled the remaining details of the _menu_ with his landlady that morning, and he could hope that without being so sumptuous as to excite the Professor's wrath, it would still be not altogether unworthy--and what goods could be rare and dainty enough?--to be set before Sylvia.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c8.p4"><s sid="9" id="brass.c8.s9">He would have liked to provide champagne, but he knew that wine would savour of ostentation in the Professor's judgment, so he had contented himself instead with claret, a sound vintage which he knew he could depend upon.</s> <s sid="10" id="brass.c8.s10">Flowers, he thought, were clearly permissible, and he had called at a florist's on his way and got some chrysanthemums of palest yellow and deepest terra-cotta, the finest he could see.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c8.s11">Some of them would look well on the centre of the table in an old Nankin blue-and-white bowl he had; the rest he could arrange about the room: there would just be time to see to all that before dressing.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c8.p5"><s sid="12" id="brass.c8.s12">Occupied with these thoughts, he turned into Vincent Square, which looked vaster than ever with the murky haze, enclosed by its high railings, and under a wide expanse of steel-blue sky, across which the clouds were driving fast like ships in full sail scudding for harbour before a storm.</s> <s sid="13" id="brass.c8.s13">Against the mist below, the young and nearly leafless trees showed flat, black profiles as of pressed seaweed, and the sky immediately above the house-tops was tinged with a sullen red from miles of lighted streets; from the river came the long-drawn tooting of tugs, mingled with the more distant wail and hysterical shrieks of railway engines on the Lambeth lines.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c8.p6"><s sid="14" id="brass.c8.s14">And now he reached the old semi-detached house in which he lodged, and noticed for the first time how the trellis-work of the veranda made, with the bared creepers and hanging baskets, a kind of decorative pattern against the windows, which were suffused with a roseate glow that looked warm and comfortable and hospitable.</s> <s sid="15" id="brass.c8.s15">He wondered whether Sylvia would notice it when she arrived.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c8.p7"><s sid="16" id="brass.c8.s16">He passed under the old wrought-iron arch that once held an oil-lamp, and up a short but rather steep flight of steps, which led to a brick porch built out at the side.</s> <s sid="17" id="brass.c8.s17">Then he let himself in, and stood spellbound with perplexed amazement,--for he was in a strange house.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c8.p8"><s sid="18" id="brass.c8.s18">In place of the modest passage with the yellow marble wall-paper, the mahogany hat-stand, and the elderly barometer in a state of chronic depression which he knew so well, he found an arched octagonal entrance-hall with arabesques of blue, crimson, and gold, and richly-embroidered hangings; the floor was marble, and from a shallow basin of alabaster in the centre a perfumed fountain rose and fell with a lulling patter.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c8.p9"><s sid="19" id="brass.c8.s19">"I must have mistaken the number," he thought, quite forgetting that his latch-key had fitted, and he was just about to retreat before his intrusion was discovered, when the hangings parted, and Mrs. Rapkin presented herself, making so deplorably incongruous a figure in such surroundings, and looking so bewildered and woebegone, that Horace, in spite of his own increasing uneasiness, had some difficulty in keeping his gravity.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c8.p10"><s sid="20" id="brass.c8.s20">"Oh, Mr. Ventimore, sir," she lamented; "whatever _will_ you go and do next, I wonder?</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c8.s21">To think of your going and having the whole place done up and altered out of knowledge like this, without a word of warning!</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c8.s22">If any halterations were required, I _do_ think as me and Rapkin had the right to be consulted."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c8.p11"><s sid="23" id="brass.c8.s23">Horace let all his chrysanthemums drop unheeded into the fountain.</s> <s sid="24" id="brass.c8.s24">He understood now: indeed, he seemed in some way to have understood almost from the first, only he would not admit it even to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c8.p12"><s sid="25" id="brass.c8.s25">The irrepressible Jinnee was at the bottom of this, of course.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c8.s26">He remembered now having made that unfortunate remark the day before about the limited accommodation his rooms afforded.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c8.p13"><s sid="27" id="brass.c8.s27">Clearly Fakrash must have taken a mental note of it, and, with that insatiable munificence which was one of his worst failings, had determined, by way of a pleasant surprise, to entirely refurnish and redecorate the apartments according to his own ideas.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c8.p14"><s sid="28" id="brass.c8.s28">It was extremely kind of him; it showed a truly grateful disposition--"but, oh!" as Horace thought, in the bitterness of his soul, "if he would only learn to let well alone and mind his own business!"</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c8.p15"><s sid="29" id="brass.c8.s29">However, the thing was done now, and he must accept the responsibility for it, since he could hardly disclose the truth.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c8.s30">"Didn't I mention I was having some alterations made?" he said carelessly.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c8.s31">"They've got the work done rather sooner than I expected.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c8.s32">Were--were they long over it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c8.p16"><s sid="33" id="brass.c8.s33">"I'm sure I can't tell you, sir, having stepped out to get some things I wanted in for to-night; and Rapkin, he was round the corner at his reading-room; and when I come back it was all done and the workmen gone 'ome; and how they could have finished such a job in the time beats me altogether, for when we 'ad the men in to do the back kitchen they took ten days over it."</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c8.p17"><s sid="34" id="brass.c8.s34">"Well," said Horace, evading this point, "however they've done this, they've done it remarkably well--you'll admit that, Mrs. Rapkin?"</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c8.p18"><s sid="35" id="brass.c8.s35">"That's as may be sir," said Mrs. Rapkin, with a sniff, "but it ain't _my_ taste, nor yet I don't think it will be Rapkin's taste when he comes to see it."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c8.p19"><s sid="36" id="brass.c8.s36">It was not Ventimore's taste either, though he was not going to confess it.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c8.s37">"Sorry for that, Mrs. Rapkin," he said, "but I've no time to talk about it now.</s> <s sid="38" id="brass.c8.s38">I must rush upstairs and dress."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c8.p20"><s sid="39" id="brass.c8.s39">"Begging your pardon, sir, but that's a total unpossibility--for they've been and took away the staircase.'</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c8.p21"><s sid="40" id="brass.c8.s40">"Taken away the staircase?</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c8.s41">Nonsense!" cried Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c8.p22"><s sid="42" id="brass.c8.s42">"So _I_ think, Mr. Ventimore--but it's what them men have done, and if you don't believe me, come and see for yourself!"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c8.p23"><s sid="43" id="brass.c8.s43">She drew the hangings aside, and revealed to Ventimore's astonished gaze a vast pillared hall with a lofty domed roof, from which hung several lamps, diffusing a subdued radiance.</s> <s sid="44" id="brass.c8.s44">High up in the wall, on his left, were the two windows which he judged to have formerly belonged to his sitting-room (for either from delicacy or inability, or simply because it had not occurred to him, the Jinnee had not interfered with the external structure), but the windows were now masked by a perforated and gilded lattice, which accounted for the pattern Horace had noticed from without.</s> <s sid="45" id="brass.c8.s45">The walls were covered with blue-and-white Oriental tiles, and a raised platform of alabaster on which were divans ran round two sides of the hall, while the side opposite to him was pierced with horseshoe-shaped arches, apparently leading to other apartments.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c8.s46">The centre of the marble floor was spread with costly rugs and piles of cushions, their rich hues glowing through the gold with which they were intricately embroidered.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c8.p24"><s sid="47" id="brass.c8.s47">"Well," said the unhappy Horace, scarcely knowing what he was saying, "it--it all looks very _cosy_, Mrs. Rapkin."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c8.p25"><s sid="48" id="brass.c8.s48">"It's not for me to say, sir; but I should like to know where you thought of dining?"</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c8.p26"><s sid="49" id="brass.c8.s49">"Where?" said Horace.</s> <s sid="50" id="brass.c8.s50">"Why, here, of course.</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c8.s51">There's plenty of room."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c8.p27"><s sid="52" id="brass.c8.s52">"There isn't a table left in the house," said Mrs. Rapkin; "so, unless you'd wish the cloth laid on the floor----"</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c8.p28"><s sid="53" id="brass.c8.s53">"Oh, there must be a table somewhere," said Horace, impatiently, "or you can borrow one.</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c8.s54">Don't _make_ difficulties, Mrs. Rapkin.</s> <s sid="55" id="brass.c8.s55">Rig up anything you like.... Now I must be off and dress."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c8.p29"><s sid="56" id="brass.c8.s56">He got rid of her, and, on entering one of the archways, discovered a smaller room, in cedar-wood encrusted with ivory and mother-o'-pearl, which was evidently his bedroom.</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c8.s57">A gorgeous robe, stiff with gold and glittering with ancient gems, was laid out for him--for the Jinnee had thought of everything--but Ventimore, naturally, preferred his own evening clothes.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c8.p30"><s sid="58" id="brass.c8.s58">"Mr. Rapkin!" he shouted, going to another arch that seemed to communicate with the basement.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c8.p31"><s sid="59" id="brass.c8.s59">"Sir?" replied his landlord, who had just returned from his "reading-room," and now appeared, without a tie and in his shirt-sleeves, looking pale and wild, as was, perhaps, intelligible in the circumstances.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c8.s60">As he entered his unfamiliar marble halls he staggered, and his red eyes rolled and his mouth gaped in a cod-like fashion.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c8.s61">"They've been at it 'ere, too, seemin'ly," he remarked huskily.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c8.p32"><s sid="62" id="brass.c8.s62">"There have been a few changes," said Horace, quietly, "as you can see.</s> <s sid="63" id="brass.c8.s63">You don't happen to know where they've put my dress-clothes, do you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c8.p33"><s sid="64" id="brass.c8.s64">"I don't 'appen to know where they've put nothink.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c8.s65">Your dress clothes?</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c8.s66">Why, I dunno where they've bin and put our little parler where me and Maria 'ave set of a hevenin' all these years regular.</s> <s sid="67" id="brass.c8.s67">I dunno where they've put the pantry, nor yet the bath-room, with 'ot and cold water laid on at my own expense.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c8.s68">And you arsk me to find your hevenin' soot!</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c8.s69">I consider, sir, I consider that a unwall--that a most unwarrant-terrible liberty have bin took at my expense."</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c8.p34"><s sid="70" id="brass.c8.s70">"My good man, don't talk rubbish!" said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c8.p35"><s sid="71" id="brass.c8.s71">"I'm talking to you about what _I know_, and I assert that an Englishman's 'ome is his cashle, and nobody's got the right when his backsh turned to go and make a 'Ummums of it.</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c8.s72">Not _nobody_ 'asn't!"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c8.p38"><s sid="80" id="brass.c8.s80">"Now, look here," said Ventimore, sharply--for it was obvious that Mr. Rapkin's studies had been lightened by copious refreshment--"pull yourself together, man, and listen to me."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c8.p39"><s sid="81" id="brass.c8.s81">"I respeckfully decline to pull myshelf togerrer f'r anybody livin'," said Mr. Rapkin, with a noble air.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c8.s82">"I shtan' 'ere upon my dignity as a man, sir.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c8.s83">I shay, I shtand 'ere upon----" Here he waved his hand, and sat down suddenly upon the marble floor.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c8.p40"><s sid="84" id="brass.c8.s84">"You can stand on anything you like--or can," said Horace; "but hear what I've got to say.</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c8.s85">The--the people who made all these alterations went beyond my instructions.</s> <s sid="86" id="brass.c8.s86">I never wanted the house interfered with like this.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c8.s87">Still, if your landlord doesn't see that its value is immensely improved, he's a fool, that's all.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c8.s88">Anyway, I'll take care _you_ shan't suffer.</s> <s sid="89" id="brass.c8.s89">If I have to put everything back in its former state, I will, at my own expense.</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c8.s90">So don't bother any more about _that_."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c8.p41"><s sid="91" id="brass.c8.s91">"You're a gen'l'man, Mr. Ventimore," said Rapkin, cautiously regaining his feet.</s> <s sid="92" id="brass.c8.s92">"There's no mishtaking a gen'l'man.</s> <s sid="93" id="brass.c8.s93">_I'm_ a gen'l'man."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c8.p42"><s sid="94" id="brass.c8.s94">"Of course you are," said Horace genially, "and I'll tell you how you're going to show it.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c8.s95">You're going straight downstairs to get your good wife to pour some cold water over your head; and then you will finish dressing, see what you can do to get a table of some sort and lay it for dinner, and be ready to announce my friends when they arrive, and wait afterwards.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c8.s96">Do you see?"</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c8.p43"><s sid="97" id="brass.c8.s97">"That will be all ri', Mr. Ventimore," said Rapkin, who was not far gone enough to be beyond understanding or obeying.</s> <s sid="98" id="brass.c8.s98">"You leave it entirely to me.</s> <s sid="99" id="brass.c8.s99">I'll unnertake that your friends shall be made comforrable, perfelly comforrable.</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c8.s100">I've lived as butler in the besht, the mosht ecxlu--most arishto--you know the sort o' fam'lies I'm tryin' to r'member--and--and everything was always all ri', and _I_ shall be all ri' in a few minutes."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c8.p44"><s sid="101" id="brass.c8.s101">With this assurance he stumbled downstairs, leaving Horace relieved to some extent.</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c8.s102">Rapkin would be sober enough after his head had been under the tap for a few minutes, and in any case there would be the hired waiter to rely upon.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c8.p46"><s sid="105" id="brass.c8.s105">Thus arrayed he re-entered the domed hall, where he was annoyed to find that no attempt had been made as yet to prepare a dinner-table, and he was just looking forlornly round for a bell when Rapkin appeared.</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c8.s106">He had apparently followed Horace's advice, for his hair looked wet and sleek, and he was comparatively sober.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c8.p51"><s sid="112" id="brass.c8.s112">"You told him that!"</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c8.s113">Horace said angrily, and then controlled himself.</s> <s sid="114" id="brass.c8.s114">"Come, Rapkin, be reasonable.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c8.s115">You can't really mean to leave your wife to cook the dinner, and serve it too!"</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c8.p52"><s sid="116" id="brass.c8.s116">"She ain't intending to do neither; she've left the house already."</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c8.p53"><s sid="117" id="brass.c8.s117">"You must fetch her back," cried Horace.</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c8.s118">"Good heavens, man, _can't_ you see what a fix you're leaving me in?</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c8.s119">My friends have started long ago--it's too late to wire to them, or make any other arrangements."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c8.p54"><s sid="120" id="brass.c8.s120">There was a knock, as he spoke, at the front door; and odd enough was the familiar sound of the cast-iron knocker in that Arabian hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c8.p55"><s sid="121" id="brass.c8.s121">"There they are!" he said, and the idea of meeting them at the door and proposing an instant adjournment to a restaurant occurred to him--till he suddenly recollected that he would have to change and try to find some money, even for that.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c8.s122">"For the last time, Rapkin," he cried in despair, "do you mean to tell me there's no dinner ready?"</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c8.p56"><s sid="123" id="brass.c8.s123">"Oh," said Rapkin, "there's dinner right enough, and a lot o' barbarious furriners downstairs a cookin' of it--that's what broke Maria's 'art--to see it all took out of her 'ands, after the trouble she'd gone to."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c8.p57"><s sid="124" id="brass.c8.s124">"But I must have somebody to wait," exclaimed Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c8.p58"><s sid="125" id="brass.c8.s125">"You've got waiters enough, as far as that goes.</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c8.s126">But if you expect a hordinary Christian man to wait along of a lot o' narsty niggers, and be at their beck and call, you're mistook, sir, for I'm going to sleep the night at my brother-in-law's and take his advice, he bein' a doorkeeper at a solicitor's orfice and knowing the law, about this 'ere business, and so I wish you a good hevening, and 'oping your dinner will be to your liking and satisfaction."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c8.p59"><s sid="127" id="brass.c8.s127">He went out by the farther archway, while from the entrance-hall Horace could hear voices he knew only too well.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c8.s128">The Futvoyes had come; well, at all events, it seemed that there would be something for them to eat, since Fakrash, in his anxiety to do the thing thoroughly, had furnished both the feast and attendance himself--but who was there to announce the guests?</s> <s sid="129" id="brass.c8.s129">Where were these waiters Rapkin had spoken of?</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c8.s130">Ought he to go and bring in his visitors himself?</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c8.p60"><s sid="131" id="brass.c8.s131">These questions answered themselves the next instant, for, as he stood there under the dome, the curtains of the central arch were drawn with a rattle, and disclosed a double line of tall slaves in rich raiment, their onyx eyes rolling and their teeth flashing in their chocolate-hued countenances, as they salaamed.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c8.p61"><s sid="132" id="brass.c8.s132">Between this double line stood Professor and Mrs. Futvoye and Sylvia, who had just removed their wraps and were gazing in undisguised astonishment on the splendours which met their view.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c8.p62"><s sid="133" id="brass.c8.s133">Horace advanced to receive them; he felt he was in for it now, and the only course left him was to put as good a face as he could on the matter, and trust to luck to pull him through without discovery or disaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="brass.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c9.s1">"So you've found your way here at last?" said Horace, as he shook hands heartily with the Professor and Mrs. Futvoye.</s> <s sid="2" id="brass.c9.s2">"I can't tell you how delighted I am to see you."</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c9.p2"><s sid="3" id="brass.c9.s3">As a matter of fact, he was very far from being at ease, which made him rather over-effusive, but he was determined that, if he could help it, he would not betray the slightest consciousness of anything _bizarre_ or unusual in his domestic arrangements.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c9.p3"><s sid="4" id="brass.c9.s4">"And these," said Mrs. Futvoye, who was extremely stately in black, with old lace and steel embroidery--"these are the bachelor lodgings you were so modest about!</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c9.s5">Really," she added, with a humorous twinkle in her shrewd eyes, "you young men seem to understand how to make yourselves comfortable--don't they, Anthony?"</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c9.p4"><s sid="6" id="brass.c9.s6">"They do, indeed," said the Professor, dryly, though it manifestly cost him some effort to conceal his appreciation.</s> <s sid="7" id="brass.c9.s7">"To produce such results as these must, if I mistake not, have entailed infinite research--and considerable expense."</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c9.p5"><s sid="8" id="brass.c9.s8">"No," said Horace, "no.</s> <s sid="9" id="brass.c9.s9">You--you'd be surprised if you knew how little."</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c9.p6"><s sid="10" id="brass.c9.s10">"I should have imagined," retorted the Professor, "that _any_ outlay on apartments which I presume you do not contemplate occupying for an extended period must be money thrown away.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c9.s11">But, doubtless, you know best."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c9.p7"><s sid="12" id="brass.c9.s12">"But your rooms are quite wonderful, Horace!" cried Sylvia, her charming eyes dilating with admiration.</s> <s sid="13" id="brass.c9.s13">"And where, _where_ did you get that magnificent dressing-gown?</s> <s sid="14" id="brass.c9.s14">I never saw anything so lovely in my life!"</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c9.p8"><s sid="15" id="brass.c9.s15">She herself was lovely enough in a billowy, shimmering frock of a delicate apple-green hue, her only ornament a deep-blue Egyptian scarab with spread wings, which was suspended from her neck by a slender gold chain.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c9.p9"><s sid="16" id="brass.c9.s16">"I--I ought to apologise for receiving you in this costume," said Horace, with embarrassment; "but the fact is, I couldn't find my evening clothes anywhere, so--so I put on the first things that came to hand."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c9.p10"><s sid="17" id="brass.c9.s17">"It is hardly necessary," said the Professor, conscious of being correctly clad, and unconscious that his shirt-front was bulging and his long-eared white tie beginning to work up towards his left jaw--"hardly necessary to offer any apology for the simplicity of your costume--which is entirely in keeping with the--ah--strictly Oriental character of your interior."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c9.p11"><s sid="18" id="brass.c9.s18">"_I_ feel dreadfully out of keeping!" said Sylvia, "for there's nothing in the least Oriental about _me_--unless it's my scarab--and he's I don't know how many centuries behind the time, poor dear!"</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c9.p12" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="brass.c9.s19">"If you said <qs/>'thousands of years,'<qe/> my dear," corrected the Professor, "you would be more accurate.</s> <s sid="20" id="brass.c9.s20">That scarab was taken out of a tomb of the thirteenth dynasty."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c9.p13"><s sid="21" id="brass.c9.s21">"Well, I'm sure he'd rather be where he is," said Sylvia, and Ventimore entirely agreed with her.</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c9.s22">"Horace, I _must_ look at everything.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c9.s23">How clever and original of you to transform an ordinary London house into this!"</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c9.p14"><s sid="24" id="brass.c9.s24">"Oh, well, you see," explained Horace, "it--it wasn't exactly done by me."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c9.p15"><s sid="25" id="brass.c9.s25">"Whoever did it," said the Professor, "must have devoted considerable study to Eastern art and architecture.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c9.s26">May I ask the name of the firm who executed the alterations?"</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c9.p16"><s sid="27" id="brass.c9.s27">"I really couldn't tell you, sir," answered Horace, who was beginning to understand how very bad a _mauvais quart d'heure_ can be.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c9.p17"><s sid="28" id="brass.c9.s28">"You can't tell me!" exclaimed the Professor.</s> <s sid="29" id="brass.c9.s29">"You order these extensive, and _I_ should say expensive, decorations, and you don't know the firm you selected to carry them out!"</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c9.p18"><s sid="30" id="brass.c9.s30">"Of course I _know_," said Horace, "only I don't happen to remember at this moment.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c9.s31">Let me see, now.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c9.s32">Was it Liberty?</s> <s sid="33" id="brass.c9.s33">No, I'm almost certain it wasn't Liberty.</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c9.s34">It might have been Maple, but I'm not sure.</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c9.s35">Whoever did do it, they were marvellously cheap."</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c9.p19"><s sid="36" id="brass.c9.s36">"I am glad to hear it," said the Professor, in his most unpleasant tone.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c9.s37">"Where is your dining-room?"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c9.p20"><s sid="38" id="brass.c9.s38">"Why, I rather think," said Horace, helplessly, as he saw a train of attendants laying a round cloth on the floor, "I rather think _this_ is the dining-room."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c9.p21"><s sid="39" id="brass.c9.s39">"You appear to be in some doubt?" said the Professor.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c9.p22"><s sid="40" id="brass.c9.s40">"I leave it to them--it depends where they choose to lay the cloth," said Horace.</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c9.s41">"Sometimes in one place; sometimes in another.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c9.s42">There's a great charm in uncertainty," he faltered.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c9.p23"><s sid="43" id="brass.c9.s43">"Doubtless," said the Professor.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c9.p24"><s sid="44" id="brass.c9.s44">By this time two of the slaves, under the direction of a tall and turbaned black, had set a low ebony stool, inlaid with silver and tortoiseshell in strange devices, on the round carpet, when other attendants followed with a circular silver tray containing covered dishes, which they placed on the stool and salaamed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c9.p25"><s sid="45" id="brass.c9.s45">"Your--ah--groom of the chambers," said the Professor, "seems to have decided that we should dine here.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c9.s46">I observe they are making signs to you that the food is on the table."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c9.p26"><s sid="47" id="brass.c9.s47">"So it is," said Ventimore.</s> <s sid="48" id="brass.c9.s48">"Shall we sit down?"</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c9.p27"><s sid="49" id="brass.c9.s49">"But, my dear Horace," said Mrs. Futvoye, "your butler has forgotten the chairs."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c9.p28"><s sid="50" id="brass.c9.s50">"You don't appear to realise, my dear," said the Professor, "that in such an interior as this chairs would be hopelessly incongruous."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c9.p29"><s sid="51" id="brass.c9.s51">"I'm afraid there aren't any," said Horace, for there was nothing but four fat cushions.</s> <s sid="52" id="brass.c9.s52">"Let's sit down on these," he proposed.</s> <s sid="53" id="brass.c9.s53">"It--it's more fun!"</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c9.p30"><s sid="54" id="brass.c9.s54">"At my time of life," said the Professor, irritably, as he let himself down on the plumpest cushion, "such fun as may be derived from eating one's meals on the floor fails to appeal to my sense of humour.</s> <s sid="55" id="brass.c9.s55">However, I admit that it is thoroughly Oriental."</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c9.p31"><s sid="56" id="brass.c9.s56">"_I_ think it's delightful," said Sylvia; "ever so much nicer than a stiff, conventional dinner-party."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c9.p32"><s sid="57" id="brass.c9.s57">"One may be unconventional," remarked her father, "without escaping the penalty of stiffness.</s> <s sid="58" id="brass.c9.s58">Go away, sir! go away!" he added snappishly, to one of the slaves, who was attempting to pour water over his hands.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c9.s59">"Your servant, Ventimore, appears to imagine that I go out to dinner without taking the trouble to wash my hands previously.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c9.s60">This, I may mention, is _not_ the case."</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c9.p33"><s sid="61" id="brass.c9.s61">"It's only an Eastern ceremony, Professor," said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c9.p34"><s sid="62" id="brass.c9.s62">"I am perfectly well aware of what is customary in the East," retorted the Professor; "it does not follow that such--ah--hygienic precautions are either necessary or desirable at a Western table."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c9.p35"><s sid="63" id="brass.c9.s63">Horace made no reply; he was too much occupied in gazing blankly at the silver dish-covers and wondering what in the world might be underneath; nor was his perplexity relieved when the covers were removed, for he was quite at a loss to guess how he was supposed to help the contents without so much as a fork.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c9.p36"><s sid="64" id="brass.c9.s64">The chief attendant, however, solved that difficulty by intimating in pantomime that the guests were expected to use their fingers.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c9.p37"><s sid="65" id="brass.c9.s65">Sylvia accomplished this daintily and with intense amusement, but her father and mother made no secret of their repugnance.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c9.s66">"If I were dining in the desert with a Sheik, sir," observed the Professor, "I should, I hope, know how to conform to his habits and prejudices.</s> <s sid="67" id="brass.c9.s67">Here, in the heart of London, I confess all this strikes me as a piece of needless pedantry."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c9.p38"><s sid="68" id="brass.c9.s68">"I'm very sorry," said Horace; "I'd have some knives and forks if I could--but I'm afraid these fellows don't even understand what they are, so it's useless to order any.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c9.s69">We--we must rough it a little, that's all.</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c9.s70">I hope that--er--fish is all right, Professor?"</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c9.p39"><s sid="71" id="brass.c9.s71">He did not know precisely what kind of fish it was, but it was fried in oil of sesame and flavoured with a mixture of cinnamon and ginger, and the Professor did not appear to be making much progress with it.</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c9.s72">Ventimore himself would have infinitely preferred the original cod and oyster sauce, but that could not be helped now.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c9.p40"><s sid="73" id="brass.c9.s73">"Thank you," said the Professor, "it is curious--but characteristic.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c9.s74">Not _any_ more, thank you."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c9.p41"><s sid="75" id="brass.c9.s75">Horace could only trust that the next course would be more of a success.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c9.s76">It was a dish of mutton, stewed with peaches, jujubes and sugar, which Sylvia declared was delicious.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c9.s77">Her parents made no comment.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c9.p42"><s sid="78" id="brass.c9.s78">"Might I ask for something to drink?" said the Professor, presently; whereupon a cupbearer poured him a goblet of iced sherbet perfumed with conserve of violets.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c9.p43"><s sid="79" id="brass.c9.s79">"I'm very sorry, my dear fellow," he said, after sipping it, "but if I drink this I shall be ill all next day.</s> <s sid="80" id="brass.c9.s80">If I might have a glass of wine----"</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c9.p44"><s sid="81" id="brass.c9.s81">Another slave instantly handed him a cup of wine, which he tasted and set down with a wry face and a shudder.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c9.s82">Horace tried some afterwards, and was not surprised.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c9.s83">It was a strong, harsh wine, in which goatskin and resin struggled for predominance.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c9.p45"><s sid="84" id="brass.c9.s84">"It's an old and, I make no doubt, a fine wine," observed the Professor, with studied politeness, "but I fancy it must have suffered in transportation.</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c9.s85">I really think that, with my gouty tendency, a little whisky and Apollinaris would be better for me--if you keep such occidental fluids in the house?"</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c9.p46"><s sid="86" id="brass.c9.s86">Horace felt convinced that it would be useless to order the slaves to bring whisky or Apollinaris, which were of course, unknown in the Jinnee's time, so he could do nothing but apologise for their absence.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c9.p47"><s sid="87" id="brass.c9.s87">"No matter," said the Professor; "I am not so thirsty that I cannot wait till I get home."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c9.p48"><s sid="88" id="brass.c9.s88">It was some consolation that both Sylvia and her mother commended the sherbet, and even appreciated--or were so obliging as to say they appreciated--the _entree_, which consisted of rice and mincemeat wrapped in vine-leaves, and certainly was not appetising in appearance, besides being difficult to dispose of gracefully.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c9.p49"><s sid="89" id="brass.c9.s89">It was followed by a whole lamb fried in oil, stuffed with pounded pistachio nuts, pepper, nutmeg, and coriander seeds, and liberally besprinkled with rose-water and musk.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c9.p50"><s sid="90" id="brass.c9.s90">Only Horace had sufficient courage to attack the lamb--and he found reason to regret it.</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c9.s91">Afterwards came fowls stuffed with raisins, parsley, and crumbled bread, and the banquet ended with pastry of weird forms and repellent aspect.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c9.p51"><s sid="92" id="brass.c9.s92">"I hope," said Horace, anxiously, "you don't find this Eastern cookery very--er--unpalatable?"--he himself was feeling distinctly unwell:</s> <s sid="93" id="brass.c9.s93">"it's rather a change from the ordinary routine."</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c9.p52"><s sid="94" id="brass.c9.s94">"I have made a truly wonderful dinner, thank you," replied the Professor, not, it is to be feared, without intention.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c9.s95">"Even in the East I have eaten nothing approaching this."</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c9.p53"><s sid="96" id="brass.c9.s96">"But where did your landlady pick up this extraordinary cooking, my dear Horace?" said Mrs. Futvoye.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c9.s97">"I thought you said she was merely a plain cook.</s> <s sid="98" id="brass.c9.s98">Has she ever lived in the East?"</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c9.p54"><s sid="99" id="brass.c9.s99">"Not exactly _in_ the East," exclaimed Horace; "not what you would call _living_ there.</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c9.s100">The fact is," he continued, feeling that he was in danger of drivelling, and that he had better be as candid as he could, "this dinner _wasn't_ cooked by her.</s> <s sid="101" id="brass.c9.s101">She--she was obliged to go away quite suddenly.</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c9.s102">So the dinner was all sent in by--by a sort of contractor, you know.</s> <s sid="103" id="brass.c9.s103">He supplies the whole thing, waiters and all."</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c9.p55"><s sid="104" id="brass.c9.s104">"I was thinking," said the Professor, "that for a bachelor--an _engaged_ bachelor--you seemed to maintain rather a large establishment."</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c9.p56"><s sid="105" id="brass.c9.s105">"Oh, they're only here for the evening, sir," said Horace.</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c9.s106">"Capital fellows--more picturesque than the local greengrocer--and they don't breathe on the top of your head."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c9.p57"><s sid="107" id="brass.c9.s107">"They're perfect dears, Horace," remarked Sylvia; "only--well, just a _little_ creepy-crawly to look at!"</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c9.p58"><s sid="108" id="brass.c9.s108">"It would ill become me to criticise the style and method of our entertainment," put in the Professor, acidly, "otherwise I might be tempted to observe that it scarcely showed that regard for economy which I should have----"</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c9.p59"><s sid="109" id="brass.c9.s109">"Now, Anthony," put in his wife, "don't let us have any fault-finding.</s> <s sid="110" id="brass.c9.s110">I'm sure Horace has done it all delightfully--yes, delightfully; and even if he _has_ been just a little extravagant, it's not as if he was obliged to be as economical _now_, you know!"</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c9.p60"><s sid="111" id="brass.c9.s111">"My dear," said the Professor, "I have yet to learn that the prospect of an increased income in the remote future is any justification for reckless profusion in the present."</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c9.p61"><s sid="112" id="brass.c9.s112">"If you only knew," said Horace, "you wouldn't call it profusion.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c9.s113">It--it's not at all the dinner I meant it to be, and I'm afraid it wasn't particularly nice--but it's certainly not expensive."</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c9.p62"><s sid="114" id="brass.c9.s114">"Expensive is, of course, a very relative term.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c9.s115">But I think I have the right to ask whether this is the footing on which you propose to begin your married life?"</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c9.p63"><s sid="116" id="brass.c9.s116">It was an extremely awkward question, as the reader will perceive.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c9.s117">If Ventimore replied--as he might with truth--that he had no intention whatever of maintaining his wife in luxury such as that, he stood convicted of selfish indulgence as a bachelor; if, on the other hand, he declared that he _did_ propose to maintain his wife in the same fantastic and exaggerated splendour as the present, it would certainly confirm her father's disbelief in his prudence and economy.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c9.p64"><s sid="118" id="brass.c9.s118">And it was that egregious old ass of a Jinnee, as Horace thought, with suppressed rage, who had let him in for all this, and who was now far beyond all remonstrance or reproach!</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c9.p65"><s sid="119" id="brass.c9.s119">Before he could bring himself to answer the question, the attendants had noiselessly removed the tray and stool, and were handing round rosewater in a silver ewer and basin, the character of which, luckily or otherwise, turned the Professor's inquisitiveness into a different channel.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c9.p66"><s sid="120" id="brass.c9.s120">"These are not bad--really not bad at all," he said, inspecting the design.</s> <s sid="121" id="brass.c9.s121">"Where did you manage to pick them up?"</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c9.p67"><s sid="122" id="brass.c9.s122">"I didn't," said Horace; "they're provided by the--the person who supplies the dinner."</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c9.p68"><s sid="123" id="brass.c9.s123">"Can you give me his address?" said the Professor, scenting a bargain; "because really, you know, these things are probably antiques--much too good to be used for business purposes."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c9.p69"><s sid="124" id="brass.c9.s124">"I'm wrong," said Horace, lamely; "these particular things are--are lent by an eccentric Oriental gentleman, as a great favour."</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="brass.c9.p73"><s sid="130" id="brass.c9.s130">"No," said Horace, in a state of prickly heat; "it wouldn't be any use.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c9.s131">His collection is never shown.</s> <s sid="132" id="brass.c9.s132">He--he's a most peculiar man.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c9.s133">And just now he's abroad."</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="brass.c9.p74"><s sid="134" id="brass.c9.s134">"Ah! pardon me if I've been indiscreet; but I concluded from what you said that this--ah--banquet was furnished by a professional caterer."</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c9.p75"><s sid="135" id="brass.c9.s135">"Oh, the banquet?</s> <s sid="136" id="brass.c9.s136">Yes, _that_ came from the Stores," said Horace, mendaciously.</s> <s sid="137" id="brass.c9.s137">"The--the Oriental Cookery Department.</s> <s sid="138" id="brass.c9.s138">They've just started it, you know; so--so I thought I'd give them a trial.</s> <s sid="139" id="brass.c9.s139">But it's not what I call properly organised yet."</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="brass.c9.p76"><s sid="140" id="brass.c9.s140">The slaves were now, with low obeisances, inviting them to seat themselves on the divan which lined part of the hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="brass.c9.p77"><s sid="141" id="brass.c9.s141">"Ha!" said the Professor, as he rose from his cushion, cracking audibly, "so we're to have our coffee and what not over there, hey?...

<p pid="78" id="brass.c9.p78"><s sid="143" id="brass.c9.s143">"Smoke?" said Horace, "Why, of course!</s> <s sid="144" id="brass.c9.s144">All over the place.</s> <s sid="145" id="brass.c9.s145">Here," he said, clapping his hands, which brought an obsequious slave instantly to his side; "just bring coffee and cigars, will you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="brass.c9.p79"><s sid="146" id="brass.c9.s146">The slave rolled his brandy-ball eyes in obvious perplexity.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="brass.c9.p80" type="speech"><s sid="147" id="brass.c9.s147">"Coffee," said Horace; "you must know what coffee is.</s> <s sid="148" id="brass.c9.s148">And cigarettes.</s> <s sid="149" id="brass.c9.s149">Well, _chibouks_, then--<qs/>'hubble-bubbles'<qe/>--if that's what you call them."</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="brass.c9.p81"><s sid="150" id="brass.c9.s150">But the slave clearly did not understand, and it suddenly struck Horace that, since 'tobacco and coffee were not introduced, even in the East, till long after the Jinnee's time, he, as the founder of the feast, would naturally be unaware how indispensable they had become at the present day.</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="brass.c9.p82"><s sid="151" id="brass.c9.s151">"I'm really awfully sorry," he said; "but they don't seem to have provided any.</s> <s sid="152" id="brass.c9.s152">I shall speak to the manager about it.</s> <s sid="153" id="brass.c9.s153">And, unfortunately, I don't know where my own cigars are."</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="brass.c9.p83"><s sid="154" id="brass.c9.s154">"It's of no consequence," said the Professor, with the sort of stoicism that minds very much.</s> <s sid="155" id="brass.c9.s155">"I am a moderate smoker at best, and Turkish coffee, though delicious, is apt to keep me awake.</s> <s sid="156" id="brass.c9.s156">But if you could let me have a look at that brass bottle you got at poor Collingham's sale, I should be obliged to you."</s> </p>

<p pid="84" id="brass.c9.p84"><s sid="157" id="brass.c9.s157">Horace had no idea where it was then, nor could he, until the Professor came to the rescue with a few words of Arabic, manage to make the slaves comprehend what he wished them to find.</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="brass.c9.p85"><s sid="158" id="brass.c9.s158">At length, however, two of them appeared, bearing the brass bottle with every sign of awe, and depositing it at Ventimore's feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="brass.c9.p86"><s sid="159" id="brass.c9.s159">Professor Futvoye, after wiping and adjusting his glasses, proceeded to examine the vessel.</s> <s sid="160" id="brass.c9.s160">"It certainly is a most unusual type of brassware," he said, "as unique in its way as the silver ewer and basin; and, as you thought, there does seem to be something resembling an inscription on the cap, though in this dim light it is almost impossible to be sure."</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="brass.c9.p87"><s sid="161" id="brass.c9.s161">While he was poring over it, Horace seated himself on the divan by Sylvia's side, hoping for one of the whispered conversations permitted to affianced lovers; he had pulled through the banquet somehow, and on the whole he felt thankful things had not gone off worse.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c9.s162">The noiseless and uncanny attendants, whom he did not know whether to regard as Efreets, or demons, or simply illusions, but whose services he had no wish to retain, had all withdrawn.</s> <s sid="163" id="brass.c9.s163">Mrs. Futvoye was peacefully slumbering, and her husband was in a better humour than he had been all the evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="88" id="brass.c9.p88"><s sid="164" id="brass.c9.s164">Suddenly from behind the hangings of one of the archways came strange, discordant sounds, barbaric janglings and thumpings, varied by yowls as of impassioned cats.</s> </p>

<p pid="89" id="brass.c9.p89"><s sid="165" id="brass.c9.s165">Sylvia drew involuntarily closer to Horace; her mother woke with a start, and the Professor looked up from the brass bottle with returning irritation.</s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="brass.c9.p90"><s sid="166" id="brass.c9.s166">"What's this?</s> <s sid="167" id="brass.c9.s167">What's this?" he demanded; "some fresh surprise in store for us?"</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="brass.c9.p91"><s sid="168" id="brass.c9.s168">It was quite as much of a surprise for Horace, but he was spared the humiliation of owning it by the entrance of some half-dozen dusky musicians swathed in white and carrying various strangely fashioned instruments, with which they squatted down in a semi-circle by the opposite wall, and began to twang, and drub, and squall with the complacent cacophony of an Eastern orchestra.</s> <s sid="169" id="brass.c9.s169">Clearly Fakrash was determined that nothing should be wanting to make the entertainment a complete success.</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="brass.c9.p92"><s sid="170" id="brass.c9.s170">"What a very extraordinary noise!" said Mrs. Futvoye; "surely they can't mean it for music?"</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="brass.c9.p93"><s sid="171" id="brass.c9.s171">"Yes, they do," said Horace; "it--it's really more harmonious than it sounds--you have to get accustomed to the--er--notation.</s> <s sid="172" id="brass.c9.s172">When you do, it's rather soothing than otherwise."</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="brass.c9.p94"><s sid="173" id="brass.c9.s173">"I dare say," said the poor lady.</s> <s sid="174" id="brass.c9.s174">"And do _they_ come from the Stores, too?"</s> </p>

<p pid="95" id="brass.c9.p95"><s sid="175" id="brass.c9.s175">"No," said Horace, with a fine assumption of candour, "they don't; they come from--the Arab Encampment at Earl's Court--parties and _fetes_ attended, you know.</s> <s sid="176" id="brass.c9.s176">But they play _here_ for nothing; they--they want to get their name known, you see; very deserving and respectable set of fellows."</s> </p>

<p pid="96" id="brass.c9.p96"><s sid="177" id="brass.c9.s177">"My dear Horace!" remarked Mrs. Futvoye, "if they expect to get engagements for parties and so on, they really ought to try and learn a tune of _some_ sort."</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="brass.c9.p97"><s sid="178" id="brass.c9.s178">"I understand, Horace," whispered Sylvia, "it's very naughty of you to have gone to all this trouble and expense (for, of course, it _has_ cost you a lot) just to please us; but, whatever, dad may say, I love you all the better for doing it!"</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="brass.c9.p98"><s sid="179" id="brass.c9.s179">And her hand stole softly into his, and he felt that he could forgive Fakrash everything, even--even the orchestra.</s> </p>

<p pid="99" id="brass.c9.p99"><s sid="180" id="brass.c9.s180">But there was something unpleasantly spectral about their shadowy forms, which showed in grotesquely baggy and bulgy shapes in the uncertain light.</s> <s sid="181" id="brass.c9.s181">Some of them wore immense and curious white head-dresses, which gave them the appearance of poulticed thumbs; and they all went on scraping and twiddling and caterwauling with a doleful monotony that Horace felt must be getting on his guests' nerves, as it certainly was on his own.</s> </p>

<p pid="100" id="brass.c9.p100"><s sid="182" id="brass.c9.s182">He did not know how to get rid of them, but he sketched a kind of gesture in the air, intended to intimate that, while their efforts had afforded the keenest pleasure to the company generally, they were unwilling to monopolise them any longer, and the artists were at liberty to retire.</s> </p>

<p pid="101" id="brass.c9.p101"><s sid="183" id="brass.c9.s183">Perhaps there is no art more liable to misconstruction than pantomime; certainly, Ventimore's efforts in this direction were misunderstood, for the music became wilder, louder, more aggressively and abominably out of tune--and then a worse thing happened.</s> </p>

<p pid="102" id="brass.c9.p102"><s sid="184" id="brass.c9.s184">For the curtains separated, and, heralded by sharp yelps from the performers, a female figure floated into the hall and began to dance with a slow and sinuous grace.</s> </p>

<p pid="103" id="brass.c9.p103"><s sid="185" id="brass.c9.s185">Her beauty, though of a pronounced Oriental type, was unmistakable, even in the subdued light which fell on her; her diaphanous robe indicated a faultless form; her dark tresses were braided with sequins; she had the long, lustrous eyes, the dusky cheeks artificially whitened, and the fixed scarlet smile of the Eastern dancing-girl of all time.</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="brass.c9.p104"><s sid="186" id="brass.c9.s186">And she paced the floor with her tinkling feet, writhing and undulating like some beautiful cobra, while the players worked themselves up to yet higher and higher stages of frenzy.</s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="brass.c9.p105"><s sid="187" id="brass.c9.s187">Ventimore, as he sat there looking helplessly on, felt a return of his resentment against the Jinnee.</s> <s sid="188" id="brass.c9.s188">It was really too bad of him; he ought, at his age, to have known better!</s> </p>

<p pid="106" id="brass.c9.p106"><s sid="189" id="brass.c9.s189">Not that there was anything objectionable in the performance itself; but still, it was _not_ the kind of entertainment for such an occasion.</s> <s sid="190" id="brass.c9.s190">Horace wished now he had mentioned to Fakrash who the guests were whom he expected, and then perhaps even the Jinnee would have exercised more tact in his arrangements.</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="brass.c9.p107"><s sid="191" id="brass.c9.s191">"And does this girl come from Earl's Court?" inquired Mrs. Futvoye, who was now thoroughly awake.</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="brass.c9.p108"><s sid="192" id="brass.c9.s192">"Oh dear, no," said Horace; "I engaged _her_ at--at Harrod's--the Entertainment Bureau.</s> <s sid="193" id="brass.c9.s193">They told me there she was rather good--struck out a line of her own, don't you know.</s> <s sid="194" id="brass.c9.s194">But perfectly correct; she--she only does this to support an invalid aunt."</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="brass.c9.p109"><s sid="195" id="brass.c9.s195">These statements were, as he felt even in making them, not only gratuitous, but utterly unconvincing, but he had arrived at that condition in which a man discovers with terror the unsuspected amount of mendacity latent in his system.</s> </p>

<p pid="110" id="brass.c9.p110"><s sid="196" id="brass.c9.s196">"I should have thought there were other ways of supporting invalid aunts," remarked Mrs. Futvoye.</s> <s sid="197" id="brass.c9.s197">"What is this young lady's name?"</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="brass.c9.p111"><s sid="198" id="brass.c9.s198">"Tinkler," said Horace, on the spur of the moment.</s> <s sid="199" id="brass.c9.s199">"Miss Clementine Tinkler."</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="brass.c9.p112"><s sid="200" id="brass.c9.s200">"But surely she is a foreigner?"</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="brass.c9.p113" type="speech"><s sid="201" id="brass.c9.s201">"Mademoiselle, I ought to have said.</s> <s sid="202" id="brass.c9.s202">And Tinkla--with an <qs/>'a,'<qe/> you know.</s> <s sid="203" id="brass.c9.s203">I believe her mother was of Arabian extraction--but I really don't know," explained Horace, conscious that Sylvia had withdrawn her hand from his, and was regarding him with covert anxiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="brass.c9.p114"><s sid="204" id="brass.c9.s204">"I really _must_ put a stop to this," he thought.</s> </p>

<p pid="115" id="brass.c9.p115"><s sid="205" id="brass.c9.s205">"You're getting bored by all this, darling," he said aloud; "so am I.</s> <s sid="206" id="brass.c9.s206">I'll tell them to go."</s> <s sid="207" id="brass.c9.s207">And he rose and held out his hand as a sign that the dance should cease.</s> </p>

<p pid="116" id="brass.c9.p116"><s sid="208" id="brass.c9.s208">It ceased at once; but, to his unspeakable horror, the dancer crossed the floor with a swift jingling rush, and sank in a gauzy heap at his feet, seizing his hand in both hers and covering it with kisses, while she murmured speeches in some tongue unknown to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="brass.c9.p117"><s sid="209" id="brass.c9.s209">"Is this a usual feature in Miss Tinkla's entertainments, may I ask?" said Mrs. Futvoye, bristling with not unnatural indignation.</s> </p>

<p pid="118" id="brass.c9.p118"><s sid="210" id="brass.c9.s210">"I really don't know," said the unhappy Horace; "I can't make out what she's saying."</s> </p>

<p pid="119" id="brass.c9.p119"><s sid="211" id="brass.c9.s211">"If I understand her rightly," said the Professor, "she is addressing you as the 'light of her eyes and the vital spirit of her heart.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="brass.c9.p120"><s sid="212" id="brass.c9.s212">"Oh!" said Horace, "she's quite mistaken, you know.</s> <s sid="213" id="brass.c9.s213">It--it's the emotional artist temperament--they don't _mean_ anything by it.</s> <s sid="214" id="brass.c9.s214">My--my dear young lady," he added, "you've danced most delightfully, and I'm sure we're all most deeply indebted to you; but we won't detain you any longer.</s> <s sid="215" id="brass.c9.s215">Professor," he added, as she made no offer to rise, "_will_ you kindly explain to them in Arabic that I should be obliged by their going at once?"</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="brass.c9.p121"><s sid="216" id="brass.c9.s216">The Professor said a few words, which had the desired effect.</s> <s sid="217" id="brass.c9.s217">The girl gave a little scream and scudded through the archway, and the musicians seized their instruments and scuttled after her.</s> </p>

<p pid="122" id="brass.c9.p122"><s sid="218" id="brass.c9.s218">"I am so sorry," said Horace, whose evening seemed to him to have been chiefly spent in apologies; "it's not at all the kind of entertainment one would expect from a place like Whiteley's."</s> </p>

<p pid="123" id="brass.c9.p123"><s sid="219" id="brass.c9.s219">"By no means," agreed the Professor; "but I understood you to say Miss Tinkla was recommended to you by Harrod's?"</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="brass.c9.p124"><s sid="220" id="brass.c9.s220">"Very likely, sir," said Horace; "but that doesn't affect the case.</s> <s sid="221" id="brass.c9.s221">I shouldn't expect it from _them_."</s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="brass.c9.p125"><s sid="222" id="brass.c9.s222">"Probably they don't know how shamelessly that young person conducts herself," said Mrs. Futvoye.</s> <s sid="223" id="brass.c9.s223">"And I think it only right that they should be told."</s> </p>

<p pid="126" id="brass.c9.p126"><s sid="224" id="brass.c9.s224">"I shall complain, of course," said Horace.</s> <s sid="225" id="brass.c9.s225">"I shall put it very strongly."</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="brass.c9.p127"><s sid="226" id="brass.c9.s226">"A protest would have more weight coming from a woman," said Mrs. Futvoye; "and, as a shareholder in the company, I shall feel bound----"</s> </p>

<p pid="128" id="brass.c9.p128"><s sid="227" id="brass.c9.s227">"No, I wouldn't," said Horace; "in fact, you mustn't.</s> <s sid="228" id="brass.c9.s228">For, now I come to think of it, she didn't come from Harrod's, after all, or Whiteley's either."</s> </p>

<p pid="129" id="brass.c9.p129"><s sid="229" id="brass.c9.s229">"Then perhaps you will be good enough to inform us where she _did_ come from?"</s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="brass.c9.p130"><s sid="230" id="brass.c9.s230">"I would if I knew," said Horace; "but I don't."</s> </p>

<p pid="131" id="brass.c9.p131"><s sid="231" id="brass.c9.s231">"What!" cried the Professor, sharply, "do you mean to say you can't account for the existence of a dancing-girl who--in my daughter's presence--kisses your hand and addresses you by endearing epithets?"</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="brass.c9.p132"><s sid="232" id="brass.c9.s232">"Oriental metaphor!" said Horace.</s> <s sid="233" id="brass.c9.s233">"She was a little overstrung.</s> <s sid="234" id="brass.c9.s234">Of course, if I had had any idea she would make such a scene as that---- Sylvia," he broke off, "_you_ don't doubt me?"</s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="brass.c9.p133"><s sid="235" id="brass.c9.s235">"No, Horace," said Sylvia, simply, "I'm sure you must have _some_ explanation--only I do think it would be better if you gave it."</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="brass.c9.p134"><s sid="236" id="brass.c9.s236">"If I _told_ you the truth," said Horace, slowly, "you would none of you believe me!"</s> </p>

<p pid="135" id="brass.c9.p135"><s sid="237" id="brass.c9.s237">"Then you admit," put in the Professor, "that hitherto you have _not_ been telling the truth?"</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="brass.c9.p136"><s sid="238" id="brass.c9.s238">"Not as invariably as I could have wished," Horace confessed.</s> </p>

<p pid="137" id="brass.c9.p137"><s sid="239" id="brass.c9.s239">"So I suspected.</s> <s sid="240" id="brass.c9.s240">Then, unless you can bring yourself to be perfectly candid, you can hardly wonder at our asking you to consider your engagement as broken off?"</s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="brass.c9.p138"><s sid="241" id="brass.c9.s241">"Broken off!" echoed Horace.</s> <s sid="242" id="brass.c9.s242">"Sylvia, you won't give me up!</s> <s sid="243" id="brass.c9.s243">You _know_ I wouldn't do anything unworthy of you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="139" id="brass.c9.p139"><s sid="244" id="brass.c9.s244">"I'm certain that you can't have done anything which would make me love you one bit the less if I knew it.</s> <s sid="245" id="brass.c9.s245">So why not be quite open with us?"</s> </p>

<p pid="140" id="brass.c9.p140"><s sid="246" id="brass.c9.s246">"Because, darling," said Horace, "I'm in such a fix that it would only make matters worse."</s> </p>

<p pid="141" id="brass.c9.p141"><s sid="247" id="brass.c9.s247">"In that case," said the Professor, "and as it is already rather late, perhaps you will allow one of your numerous retinue to call a four-wheeler?"</s> </p>

<p pid="170" id="brass.c9.p170"><s sid="309" id="brass.c9.s309">"Certainly," said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="171" id="brass.c9.p171"><s sid="310" id="brass.c9.s310">"Then, if I were you, I should go away at once, for a complete change of air and scene."</s> </p>

<p pid="173" id="brass.c9.p173"><s sid="312" id="brass.c9.s312">"Never mind your work, my boy: leave it for a while, try a sea-voyage, go round the world, get quite away from these associations."</s> </p>

<p pid="174" id="brass.c9.p174"><s sid="313" id="brass.c9.s313">"But I might come across the Jinnee again," objected Horace; "_he's_ travelling, as I told you."</s> </p>

<p pid="177" id="brass.c9.p177"><s sid="318" id="brass.c9.s318">"No, no, my dear boy," said the Professor, soothingly, "not mad--nothing of the sort; perhaps your mental equilibrium is just a trifle--it's quite intelligible.</s> <s sid="319" id="brass.c9.s319">You see, the sudden turn in your professional prospects, coupled with your engagement to Sylvia--I've known stronger minds than yours thrown off their balance--temporarily, of course, quite temporarily--by less than that."</s> </p>

<p pid="178" id="brass.c9.p178"><s sid="320" id="brass.c9.s320">"You believe I am suffering from delusions?"</s> </p>

<p pid="179" id="brass.c9.p179"><s sid="321" id="brass.c9.s321">"I don't say that.</s> <s sid="322" id="brass.c9.s322">I think you may see ordinary things in a distorted light."</s> </p>

<p pid="180" id="brass.c9.p180"><s sid="323" id="brass.c9.s323">"Anyhow, you don't believe there really was a Jinnee inside that bottle?"</s> </p>

<p pid="182" id="brass.c9.p182"><s sid="326" id="brass.c9.s326">"Well," said Horace, "you saw all those black slaves; you ate, or tried to eat, that unutterably beastly banquet; you heard that music--and then there was the dancing-girl.</s> <s sid="327" id="brass.c9.s327">And this hall we're in, this robe I've got on--are _they_ delusions?</s> <s sid="328" id="brass.c9.s328">Because if they are, I'm afraid you will have to admit that _you're_ mad too."</s> </p>

<p pid="183" id="brass.c9.p183"><s sid="329" id="brass.c9.s329">"Ingeniously put," said the Professor.</s> <s sid="330" id="brass.c9.s330">"I fear it is unwise to argue with you.</s> <s sid="331" id="brass.c9.s331">Still, I will venture to assert that a strong imagination like yours, over-heated and saturated with Oriental ideas--to which I fear I may have contributed--is not incapable of unconsciously assisting in its own deception.</s> <s sid="332" id="brass.c9.s332">In other words, I think that you may have provided all this yourself from various quarters without any clear recollection of the fact."</s> </p>

<p pid="184" id="brass.c9.p184"><s sid="333" id="brass.c9.s333">"That's very scientific and satisfactory as far as it goes, my dear Professor," said Horace; "but there's one piece of evidence which may upset your theory--and that's this brass bottle."</s> </p>

<p pid="185" id="brass.c9.p185"><s sid="334" id="brass.c9.s334">"If your reasoning powers were in their normal condition," said the Professor, compassionately, "you would see that the mere production of an empty bottle can be no proof of what it contained--or, for that matter, that it ever contained anything at all!"</s> </p>

<p pid="186" id="brass.c9.p186"><s sid="335" id="brass.c9.s335">"Oh, I see _that_," said Horace; "but _this_ bottle has a stopper with what you yourself admit to be an inscription of some sort.</s> <s sid="336" id="brass.c9.s336">Suppose that inscription confirms my story--what then?</s> <s sid="337" id="brass.c9.s337">All I ask you to do is to make it out for yourself before you decide that I'm either a liar or a lunatic."</s> </p>

<p pid="187" id="brass.c9.p187"><s sid="338" id="brass.c9.s338">"I warn you," said the Professor, "that if you are trusting to my being unable to decipher the inscription, you are deceiving yourself.</s> <s sid="339" id="brass.c9.s339">You represent that this bottle belongs to the period of Solomon--that is, about a thousand years B.C. Probably you are not aware that the earliest specimens of Oriental metal-work in existence are not older than the tenth century of our era.</s> <s sid="340" id="brass.c9.s340">But, granting that it is as old as you allege, I shall certainly be able to read any inscription there may be on it.</s> <s sid="341" id="brass.c9.s341">I have made out clay tablets in Cuneiform which were certainly written a thousand years before Solomon's time."</s> </p>

<p pid="188" id="brass.c9.p188"><s sid="342" id="brass.c9.s342">"So much the better," said Horace.</s> <s sid="343" id="brass.c9.s343">"I'm as certain as I can be that, whatever is written on that lid--whether it's Phoenician, or Cuneiform, or anything else--must have some reference to a Jinnee confined in the bottle, or at least bear the seal of Solomon.</s> <s sid="344" id="brass.c9.s344">But there the thing is--examine it for yourself."</s> </p>

<p pid="189" id="brass.c9.p189"><s sid="345" id="brass.c9.s345">"Not now," said the Professor; "it's too late, and the light here is not strong enough.</s> <s sid="346" id="brass.c9.s346">But I'll tell you what I will do.</s> <s sid="347" id="brass.c9.s347">I'll take this stopper thing home with me, and examine it carefully to-morrow--on one condition."</s> </p>

<p pid="190" id="brass.c9.p190"><s sid="348" id="brass.c9.s348">"You have only to name it," said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="191" id="brass.c9.p191"><s sid="349" id="brass.c9.s349">"My condition is, that if I, and one or two other Orientalists to whom I may submit it, come to the conclusion that there is no real inscription at all--or, if any, that a date and meaning must be assigned to it totally inconsistent with your story--you will accept our finding and acknowledge that you have been under a delusion, and dismiss the whole affair from your mind."</s> </p>

<p pid="192" id="brass.c9.p192"><s sid="350" id="brass.c9.s350">"Oh, I don't mind agreeing to _that_," said Horace, "particularly as it's my only chance."</s> </p>

<p pid="193" id="brass.c9.p193"><s sid="351" id="brass.c9.s351">"Very well, then," said the Professor, as he removed the metal cap and put it in his pocket; "you may depend upon hearing from me in a day or two.</s> <s sid="352" id="brass.c9.s352">Meantime, my boy," he continued, almost affectionately, "why not try a short bicycle tour somewhere, hey?</s> <s sid="353" id="brass.c9.s353">You're a cyclist, I know--anything but allow yourself to dwell on Oriental subjects."</s> </p>

<p pid="194" id="brass.c9.p194"><s sid="354" id="brass.c9.s354">"It's not so easy to avoid dwelling on them as you think!" said Horace, with rather a dreary laugh.</s> <s sid="355" id="brass.c9.s355">"And I fancy, Professor, that--whether you like it or not--you'll have to believe in that Jinnee of mine sooner or later."</s> </p>

<p pid="195" id="brass.c9.p195"><s sid="356" id="brass.c9.s356">"I can scarcely conceive," replied the Professor, who was by this time at the outer door, "any degree of evidence which could succeed in convincing me that your brass bottle had ever contained an Arabian Jinnee.</s> <s sid="357" id="brass.c9.s357">However, I shall endeavour to preserve an open mind on the subject.</s> <s sid="358" id="brass.c9.s358">Good evening to you."</s> </p>

<p pid="196" id="brass.c9.p196"><s sid="359" id="brass.c9.s359">As soon as he was alone, Horace paced up and down his deserted halls in a state of simmering rage as he thought how eagerly he had looked forward to his little dinner-party; how intimate and delightful it might have been, and what a monstrous and prolonged nightmare it had actually proved.</s> <s sid="360" id="brass.c9.s360">And at the end of it there he was--in a fantastic, impossible dwelling, deserted by every one, his chances of setting himself right with Sylvia hanging on the slenderest thread; unknown difficulties and complications threatening him from every side!</s> </p>

<p pid="197" id="brass.c9.p197"><s sid="361" id="brass.c9.s361">He owed all this to Fakrash.</s> <s sid="362" id="brass.c9.s362">Yes, that incorrigibly grateful Jinnee, with his antiquated notions and his high-flown professions, had contrived to ruin him more disastrously than if he had been his bitterest foe!</s> <s sid="363" id="brass.c9.s363">Ah! if he could be face to face with him once more--if only for five minutes--he would be restrained by no false delicacy: he would tell him fairly and plainly what a meddling, blundering old fool he was.</s> <s sid="364" id="brass.c9.s364">But Fakrash had taken his flight for ever: there were no means of calling him back--nothing to be done now but go to bed and sleep--if he could!</s> </p>

<p pid="198" id="brass.c9.p198"><s sid="365" id="brass.c9.s365">Exasperated by the sense of his utter helplessness, Ventimore went to the arch which led to his bed-chamber and drew the curtain back with a furious pull.</s> <s sid="366" id="brass.c9.s366">And just within the archway, standing erect with folded arms and the smile of fatuous benignity which Ventimore was beginning to know and dread, was the form of Fakrash-el-Aamash, the Jinnee!</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c10.p18"><s sid="26" id="brass.c10.s26">"I don't know what the custom may be in Arabia," said Horace, "but with us it is not usual for a man to engage a houri to dance after dinner to amuse the lady he is proposing to marry.</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c10.s27">It's the kind of attention she'd be most unlikely to appreciate.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c10.p19"><s sid="28" id="brass.c10.s28">"Then was one of thy guests the damsel whom thou art seeking to marry?"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c10.p20"><s sid="29" id="brass.c10.s29">"She was," said Horace, "and the other two were her father and mother.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c10.s30">From which you may imagine that it was not altogether agreeable for me when your gazelle threw herself at my feet and hugged my knees and declared that I was the light of her eyes.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c10.s31">Of course, it all meant nothing--it's probably the conventional behaviour for a gazelle, and I'm not reflecting upon her in the least.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c10.s32">But, in the circumstances, it _was_ compromising."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c10.p21"><s sid="33" id="brass.c10.s33">"I thought," said Fakrash, "that thou assuredst me that thou wast not contracted to any damsel?"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c10.p22"><s sid="34" id="brass.c10.s34">"I think I only said that there was no one whom I would trouble you to procure as a wife for me," replied Horace; "I certainly was engaged--though, after this evening, my engagement is at an end--unless ... that reminds me, do you happen to know whether there really _was_ an inscription on the seal of your bottle, and what it said?"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c10.p23"><s sid="35" id="brass.c10.s35">"I know naught of any inscription," said the Jinnee; "bring me the seal that I may see it."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c10.p24"><s sid="36" id="brass.c10.s36">"I haven't got it by me at this moment," said Horace; "I lent it to my friend--the father of this young lady I told you of.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c10.s37">You see, Mr. Fakrash, you got me into--I mean, I was in such a hole over this affair that I was obliged to make a clean breast of it to him.</s> <s sid="38" id="brass.c10.s38">And he wouldn't believe it, so it struck me that there might be an inscription of some sort on the seal, saying who you were, and why Solomon had you confined in the bottle.</s> <s sid="39" id="brass.c10.s39">Then the Professor would be obliged to admit that there's something in my story."</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c10.p25"><s sid="40" id="brass.c10.s40">"Truly, I wonder at thee and at the smallness of thy penetration," the Jinnee commented; "for if there were indeed any writing upon this seal, it is not possible that one of thy race should be able to decipher it."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c10.p26"><s sid="41" id="brass.c10.s41">"Oh, I beg your pardon," said Horace; "Professor Futvoye is an Oriental scholar; he can make out any inscription, no matter how many thousands of years old it may be.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c10.s42">If anything's there, he'll decipher it.</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c10.s43">The question is whether anything _is_ there."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c10.p27"><s sid="44" id="brass.c10.s44">The effect of this speech on Fakrash was as unexpected as it was inexplicable: the Jinnee's features, usually so mild, began to work convulsively until they became terrible to look at, and suddenly, with a fierce howl, he shot up to nearly double his ordinary stature.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c10.p28"><s sid="45" id="brass.c10.s45">"O thou of little sense and breeding!" he cried, in a loud voice; "how camest thou to deliver the bottle in which I was confined into the hands of this learned man?"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c10.p29"><s sid="46" id="brass.c10.s46">Ventimore, startled as he was, did not lose his self-possession.</s> <s sid="47" id="brass.c10.s47">"My dear sir," he said, "I did not suppose you could have any further use for it.</s> <s sid="48" id="brass.c10.s48">And, as a matter of fact, I didn't give Professor Futvoye the bottle--which is over there in the corner--but merely the stopper.</s> <s sid="49" id="brass.c10.s49">I wish you wouldn't tower over me like that--it gives me a crick in the neck to talk to you.</s> <s sid="50" id="brass.c10.s50">Why on earth should you make such a fuss about my lending the seal; what possible difference can it make to you even if it does confirm my story?</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c10.s51">And it's of immense importance to _me_ that the Professor should believe I told the truth."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c10.p30"><s sid="52" id="brass.c10.s52">"I spoke in haste," said the Jinnee, slowly resuming his normal size, and looking slightly ashamed of his recent outburst as well as uncommonly foolish.</s> <s sid="53" id="brass.c10.s53">"The bottle truly is of no value; and as for the stopper, since it is but lent, it is no great matter.</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c10.s54">If there be any legend upon the seal, perchance this learned man of whom thou speakest will by this time have deciphered it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c10.p31"><s sid="55" id="brass.c10.s55">"No," said Horace, "he won't tackle it till to-morrow.</s> <s sid="56" id="brass.c10.s56">And it's as likely as not that when he does he won't find any reference to _you_--and I shall be up a taller tree than ever!"</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c10.p32"><s sid="57" id="brass.c10.s57">"Art thou so desirous that he should receive proof that thy story is true?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c10.p33"><s sid="58" id="brass.c10.s58">"Why, of course I am!</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c10.s59">Haven't I been saying so all this time?"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c10.p34"><s sid="60" id="brass.c10.s60">"Who can satisfy him so surely as I?"</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c10.p35"><s sid="61" id="brass.c10.s61">"You!" cried Horace.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c10.s62">"Do you mean to say you really would?</s> <s sid="63" id="brass.c10.s63">Mr. Fakrash, you _are_ an old brick!</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c10.s64">That would be the very thing!"</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c10.p36"><s sid="65" id="brass.c10.s65">"There is naught," said the Jinnee, smiling indulgently, "that I would not do to promote thy welfare, for thou hast rendered me inestimable service.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c10.s66">Acquaint me therefore with the abode of this sage, and I will present myself before him, and if haply he should find no inscription upon the seal, or its purport should be hidden from him, then will I convince him that thou hast spoken the truth and no lie."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c10.p37"><s sid="67" id="brass.c10.s67">Horace very willingly gave him the Professor's address.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c10.s68">"Only don't drop in on him to-night, you know," he thought it prudent to add, "or you might startle him.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c10.s69">Call any time after breakfast to-morrow, and you'll find him in."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c10.p38"><s sid="70" id="brass.c10.s70">"To-night," said Fakrash, "I return to pursue my search after Suleyman (on whom be peace!).</s> <s sid="71" id="brass.c10.s71">For not yet have I found him."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c10.p39"><s sid="72" id="brass.c10.s72">"If you _will_ try to do so many things at once," said Horace, "I don't see how you can expect much result."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c10.p40"><s sid="73" id="brass.c10.s73">"At Nineveh they knew him not--for where I left a city I found but a heap of ruins, tenanted by owls and bats."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c10.p41"><s sid="74" id="brass.c10.s74">"_They say the lion and the lizard keep the Courts_----" murmured Horace, half to himself.</s> <s sid="75" id="brass.c10.s75">"I was afraid you might be disappointed with Nineveh myself.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c10.s76">Why not run over to Sheba?</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c10.s77">You might hear of him there."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c10.p42"><s sid="78" id="brass.c10.s78">"Seba of El-Yemen--the country of Bilkees, the Queen beloved of Suleyman," said the Jinnee.</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c10.s79">"It is an excellent suggestion, and I will follow it without delay."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c10.p43"><s sid="80" id="brass.c10.s80">"But you won't forget to look in on Professor Futvoye to-morrow, will you?"</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c10.p44"><s sid="81" id="brass.c10.s81">"Assuredly I will not.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c10.s82">And now, ere I depart, tell me if there be any other service I may render thee."</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c10.p45"><s sid="83" id="brass.c10.s83">Horace hesitated.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c10.s84">"There _is_ just one," he said, "only I'm afraid you'll be offended if I mention it."</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c10.p46"><s sid="85" id="brass.c10.s85">"On the head and the eye be thy commands!" said the Jinnee; "for whatsoever thou desirest shall be accomplished, provided that it lie within my power to perform it."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c10.p47"><s sid="86" id="brass.c10.s86">"Well," said Horace, "if you're sure you don't mind, I'll tell you.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c10.s87">You've transformed this house into a wonderful place, more like the Alhambra--I don't mean the one in Leicester Square--than a London lodging-house.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c10.s88">But then I am only a lodger here, and the people the house belongs to--excellent people in their way--would very much rather have the house as it was.</s> <s sid="89" id="brass.c10.s89">They have a sort of idea that they won't be able to let these rooms as easily as the others."</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c10.p48"><s sid="90" id="brass.c10.s90">"Base and sordid dogs!" said the Jinnee, with contempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c10.p49"><s sid="91" id="brass.c10.s91">"Possibly," said Horace, "it's narrow-minded of them--but that's the way they look at it.</s> <s sid="92" id="brass.c10.s92">They've actually left rather than stay here.</s> <s sid="93" id="brass.c10.s93">And it's _their_ house--not mine."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c10.p50"><s sid="94" id="brass.c10.s94">"If they abandon this dwelling, thou wilt remain in the more secure possession."</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c10.p51"><s sid="95" id="brass.c10.s95">"Oh, _shall_ I, though?</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c10.s96">They'll go to law and have me turned out, and I shall have to pay ruinous damages into the bargain.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c10.s97">So, you see, what you intended as a kindness will only bring me bad luck."</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c10.p52"><s sid="98" id="brass.c10.s98">"Come--without more words--to the statement of thy request," said Fakrash, "for I am in haste."</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c10.p53"><s sid="99" id="brass.c10.s99">"All I want you to do," replied Horace, in some anxiety as to what the effect of his request would be, "is to put everything here back to what it was before.</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c10.s100">It won't take you a minute."</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c10.p54"><s sid="101" id="brass.c10.s101">"Of a truth," exclaimed Fakrash, "to bestow a favour upon thee is but a thankless undertaking, for not once, but twice, hast thou rejected my benefits--and now, behold, I am at a loss to devise means to gratify thee!"</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c10.p55"><s sid="102" id="brass.c10.s102">"I know I've abused your good nature," said Horace; "but if you'll only do this, and then convince the Professor that my story is true, I shall be more than satisfied.</s> <s sid="103" id="brass.c10.s103">I'll never ask another favour of you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c10.p56"><s sid="104" id="brass.c10.s104">"My benevolence towards thee hath no bounds--as thou shalt see; and I can deny thee nothing, for truly thou art a worthy and temperate young man.</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c10.s105">Farewell, then, and be it according to thy desire."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c10.p57"><s sid="106" id="brass.c10.s106">He raised his arms above his head, and shot up like a rocket towards the lofty dome, which split asunder to let him pass.</s> <s sid="107" id="brass.c10.s107">Horace, as he gazed after him, had a momentary glimpse of deep blue sky, with a star or two that seemed to be hurrying through the transparent opal scud, before the roof closed in once more.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c10.p58"><s sid="108" id="brass.c10.s108">Then came a low, rumbling sound, with a shock like a mild earthquake: the slender pillars swayed under their horseshoe arches; the big hanging-lanterns went out; the walls narrowed, and the floor heaved and rose--till Ventimore found himself up in his own familiar sitting-room once more, in the dark.</s> <s sid="109" id="brass.c10.s109">Outside he could see the great square still shrouded in grey haze--the street lamps flickering in the wind; a belated reveller was beguiling his homeward way by rattling his stick against the railings as he passed.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c10.p59"><s sid="110" id="brass.c10.s110">Inside the room everything was exactly as before, and Horace found it difficult to believe that a few minutes earlier he had been standing on that same site, but twenty feet or so below his present level, in a spacious blue-tiled hall, with a domed ceiling and gaudy pillared arches.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c10.p60"><s sid="111" id="brass.c10.s111">But he was very far from regretting his short-lived splendour; he burnt with shame and resentment whenever he thought of that nightmare banquet, which was so unlike the quiet, unpretentious little dinner he had looked forward to.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c10.p61"><s sid="112" id="brass.c10.s112">However, it was over now, and it was useless to worry himself about what could not be helped.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c10.s113">Besides, fortunately, there was no great harm done; the Jinnee had been brought to see his mistake, and, to do him justice, had shown himself willing enough to put it right.</s> <s sid="114" id="brass.c10.s114">He had promised to go and see the Professor next day, and the result of the interview could not fail to be satisfactory.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c10.s115">And after this, Ventimore thought, Fakrash would have the sense and good feeling not to interfere in his affairs again.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c10.p62"><s sid="116" id="brass.c10.s116">Meanwhile he could sleep now with a mind free from his worst anxieties, and he went to his room in a spirit of intense thankfulness that he had a Christian bed to sleep in.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c10.s117">He took off his gorgeous robes--the only things that remained to prove to him that the events of that evening had been no delusion--and locked them in his wardrobe with a sense of relief that he would never be required to wear them again, and his last conscious thought before he fell asleep was the comforting reflection that, if there were any barrier between Sylvia and himself, it would be removed in the course of a very few more hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c11.p4"><s sid="4" id="brass.c11.s4">"It was extremely inconvenient," said Horace, "and not at all what I should have expected from you.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c11.s5">But possibly you had some reason for it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c11.p5"><s sid="6" id="brass.c11.s6">"Why, sir," said Mrs. Rapkin, running her hand nervously along the back of a chair, "the fact is, something come over me, and come over Rapkin, as we couldn't stop here another minute not if it was ever so."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c11.p10"><s sid="14" id="brass.c11.s14">"From the state your husband was in last night," said Horace, "I should say he was capable of seeing anything--and double of most things."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c11.p12"><s sid="17" id="brass.c11.s17">"I don't suggest that for a moment, Mrs. Rapkin," said Horace; "only, if the house was as you describe last night, how do you account for its being all right this morning?"</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c11.p14"><s sid="20" id="brass.c11.s20">"I shouldn't wonder if you were right, Mrs. Rapkin," said Horace blandly; "you see, you had been exerting yourself over the cooking, and no doubt were in an over-excited state, and, as you say, those camels had taken hold of your imagination until you were ready to see anything that Rapkin saw, and _he_ was ready to see anything _you_ did.</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c11.s21">It's not at all uncommon.</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c11.s22">Scientific people, I believe, call it 'Collective Hallucination.'"</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c11.p56"><s sid="111" id="brass.c11.s111">"This is plain speaking with a vengeance," he said; "I'm sorry you're dissatisfied.</s> <s sid="112" id="brass.c11.s112">I did my best to carry out your instructions."</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c11.p64"><s sid="129" id="brass.c11.s129">"Oh," said Horace, feeling deathly sick, "in that case it is useless, of course, to suggest any modifications."</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c11.p65"><s sid="130" id="brass.c11.s130">"Absolutely!" said Mr. Wackerbath.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c11.p66"><s sid="131" id="brass.c11.s131">"Very well, then; there's no more to be said," replied Horace.</s> <s sid="132" id="brass.c11.s132">"You will have no difficulty in finding an architect who will be more successful in realising your intentions.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c11.s133">Mr. Beevor, the gentleman you met just now," he added, with a touch of bitterness, "would probably be just your man.</s> <s sid="134" id="brass.c11.s134">Of course I retire altogether.</s> <s sid="135" id="brass.c11.s135">And really, if any one is the sufferer over this, I fancy it's myself.</s> <s sid="136" id="brass.c11.s136">I can't see how you are any the worse."</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c11.p69"><s sid="139" id="brass.c11.s139">"I tell you, sir, I saw it with my own eyes driving to the station this morning; my coachman and footman saw it; my wife saw it--damn it, sir, we _all_ saw it!"</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="brass.c11.p70"><s sid="140" id="brass.c11.s140">Then Horace understood.</s> <s sid="141" id="brass.c11.s141">His indefatigable Jinnee had been at work again!</s> <s sid="142" id="brass.c11.s142">Of course, for Fakrash it must have been what he would term "the easiest of affairs"--especially after a glance at the plans (and Ventimore remembered that the Jinnee had surprised him at work upon them, and even requested to have them explained to him)--to dispense with contractors and bricklayers and carpenters, and construct the entire building in the course of a single night.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="brass.c11.p71"><s sid="143" id="brass.c11.s143">It was a generous and spirited action--but, particularly now that the original designs had been found faulty and rejected, it placed the unfortunate architect in a most invidious position.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="brass.c11.p73"><s sid="145" id="brass.c11.s145">"I--I----" began Horace, utterly broken down; and then he saw, with emotions that may be imagined, the Jinnee himself, in his green robes, standing immediately behind Mr. Wackerbath.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="brass.c11.p74"><s sid="146" id="brass.c11.s146">"Greeting to you," said Fakrash, coming forward with his smile of amiable cunning.</s> <s sid="147" id="brass.c11.s147">"If I mistake not," he added, addressing the startled estate agent, who had jumped visibly, "thou art the merchant for whom my son here," and he laid a hand on Horace's shrinking shoulder, "undertook to construct a mansion?"</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c11.p75"><s sid="148" id="brass.c11.s148">"I am," said Mr. Wackerbath, in some mystification.</s> <s sid="149" id="brass.c11.s149">"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Ventimore, senior?"</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="brass.c11.p76"><s sid="150" id="brass.c11.s150">"No, no," put in Horace; "no relation.</s> <s sid="151" id="brass.c11.s151">He's a sort of informal partner."</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="brass.c11.p77"><s sid="152" id="brass.c11.s152">"Hast thou not found him an architect of divine gifts?" inquired the Jinnee, beaming with pride.</s> <s sid="153" id="brass.c11.s153">"Is not the palace that he hath raised for thee by his transcendent accomplishments a marvel of beauty and stateliness, and one that Sultans might envy?"</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="brass.c11.p78"><s sid="154" id="brass.c11.s154">"No, sir!" shouted the infuriated Mr. Wackerbath; "since you ask my opinion, it's nothing of the sort!</s> <s sid="155" id="brass.c11.s155">It's a ridiculous tom-fool cross between the palm-house at Kew and the Brighton Pavilion!</s> <s sid="156" id="brass.c11.s156">There's no billiard-room, and not a decent bedroom in the house.</s> <s sid="157" id="brass.c11.s157">I've been all over it, so I ought to know; and as for drainage, there isn't a sign of it.</s> <s sid="158" id="brass.c11.s158">And he has the brass--ah, I should say, the unblushing effrontery--to call that a country house!"</s> </p>

<p pid="112" id="brass.c11.p112"><s sid="256" id="brass.c11.s256">"Acquaint me with thy wishes," said Fakrash, a little abashed, "for thou knowest that I can refuse thee naught."</s> </p>

<p pid="113" id="brass.c11.p113"><s sid="257" id="brass.c11.s257">"Then," said Horace, boldly, "couldn't you remove that palace--dissipate it into space or something?"</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="brass.c11.p114"><s sid="258" id="brass.c11.s258">"Verily," said the Jinnee, in an aggravated tone, "to do good acts unto such as thee is but wasted time, for thou givest me no peace till they are undone!"</s> </p>

<p pid="115" id="brass.c11.p115"><s sid="259" id="brass.c11.s259">"This is the last time," urged Horace; "I promise never to ask you for anything again."</s> </p>

<p pid="117" id="brass.c11.p117"><s sid="264" id="brass.c11.s264">"Another surprise for poor old Wackerbath," thought Horace, "but a pleasant one this time.</s> <s sid="265" id="brass.c11.s265">My dear Mr. Fakrash," he said aloud, "I really can't say how grateful I am to you.</s> <s sid="266" id="brass.c11.s266">And now--I hate bothering you like this, but if you _could_ manage to look in on Professor Futvoye----"</s> </p>

<p pid="118" id="brass.c11.p118"><s sid="267" id="brass.c11.s267">"What!" cried the Jinnee, "yet another request?</s> <s sid="268" id="brass.c11.s268">Already!"</s> </p>

<p pid="119" id="brass.c11.p119"><s sid="269" id="brass.c11.s269">"Well, you promised you'd do that before, you know!" said Horace.</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="brass.c11.p120"><s sid="270" id="brass.c11.s270">"For that matter," remarked Fakrash, "I have already fulfilled my promise."</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="brass.c11.p121"><s sid="271" id="brass.c11.s271">"You have?"</s> <s sid="272" id="brass.c11.s272">Horace exclaimed.</s> <s sid="273" id="brass.c11.s273">"And does he believe now that it's all true about that bottle?"</s> </p>

<p pid="122" id="brass.c11.p122"><s sid="274" id="brass.c11.s274">"When I left him," answered the Jinnee, "all his doubts were removed."</s> </p>

<p pid="123" id="brass.c11.p123"><s sid="275" id="brass.c11.s275">"By Jove, you _are_ a trump!" cried Horace, only too glad to be able to commend with sincerity.</s> <s sid="276" id="brass.c11.s276">"And do you think, if I went to him now, I should find him the same as usual?"</s> </p>

<p pid="124" id="brass.c11.p124"><s sid="277" id="brass.c11.s277">"Nay," said Fakrash, with his weak and yet inscrutable smile, "that is more than I can promise thee."</s> </p>

<p pid="125" id="brass.c11.p125"><s sid="278" id="brass.c11.s278">"But why?" asked Horace, "if he knows all?"</s> </p>

<p pid="126" id="brass.c11.p126"><s sid="279" id="brass.c11.s279">There was the oddest expression in the Jinnee's furtive eyes: a kind of elfin mischief combined with a sense of wrong-doing, like a naughty child whose palate is still reminiscent of illicit jam.</s> <s sid="280" id="brass.c11.s280">"Because," he replied, with a sound between a giggle and a chuckle, "because, in order to overcome his unbelief, it was necessary to transform him into a one-eyed mule of hideous appearance."</s> </p>

<p pid="127" id="brass.c11.p127"><s sid="281" id="brass.c11.s281">"_What!_" cried Horace.</s> <s sid="282" id="brass.c11.s282">But, whether to avoid thanks or explanations, the Jinnee had disappeared with his customary abruptness.</s> </p>

<p pid="128" id="brass.c11.p128"><s sid="283" id="brass.c11.s283">"Fakrash!" shouted Horace, "Mr. Fakrash!</s> <s sid="284" id="brass.c11.s284">Come back!</s> <s sid="285" id="brass.c11.s285">Do you hear?</s> <s sid="286" id="brass.c11.s286">I _must_ speak to you!"</s> <s sid="287" id="brass.c11.s287">There was no answer; the Jinnee might be well on his way to Lake Chad, or Jericho, by that time--he was certainly far enough from Great Cloister Street.</s> </p>

<p pid="129" id="brass.c11.p129"><s sid="288" id="brass.c11.s288">Horace sat down at his drawing-table, and, his head buried in his hands, tried to think out this latest complication.</s> <s sid="289" id="brass.c11.s289">Fakrash had transformed Professor Futvoye into a one-eyed mule.</s> <s sid="290" id="brass.c11.s290">It would have seemed incredible, almost unthinkable, once, but so many impossibilities had happened to Horace of late that one more made little or no strain upon his credulity.</s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="brass.c11.p130"><s sid="291" id="brass.c11.s291">What he felt chiefly was the new barrier that this event must raise between himself and Sylvia; to do him justice, the mere fact that the father of his _fiancee_ was a mule did not lessen his ardour in the slightest.</s> <s sid="292" id="brass.c11.s292">Even if he had felt no personal responsibility for the calamity, he loved Sylvia far too well to be deterred by it, and few family cupboards are without a skeleton of some sort.</s> </p>

<p pid="131" id="brass.c11.p131"><s sid="293" id="brass.c11.s293">With courage and the determination to look only on the bright side of things, almost any domestic drawback can be lived down.</s> </p>

<p pid="132" id="brass.c11.p132"><s sid="294" id="brass.c11.s294">But the real point, as he instantly recognised, was whether in the changed condition of circumstances Sylvia would consent to marry _him_.</s> <s sid="295" id="brass.c11.s295">Might she not, after the experiences of that abominable dinner of his the night before, connect him in some way with her poor father's transformation?</s> <s sid="296" id="brass.c11.s296">She might even suspect him of employing this means of compelling the Professor to renew their engagement; and, indeed, Horace was by no means certain himself that the Jinnee might not have acted from some muddle-headed motive of this kind.</s> <s sid="297" id="brass.c11.s297">It was likely enough that the Professor, after learning the truth, should have refused to allow his daughter to marry the _protege_ of so dubious a patron, and that Fakrash had then resorted to pressure.</s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="brass.c11.p133"><s sid="298" id="brass.c11.s298">In any case, Ventimore knew Sylvia well enough to feel sure that pride would steel her heart against him so long as this obstacle remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="brass.c11.p134"><s sid="299" id="brass.c11.s299">It would be unseemly to set down here all that Horace said and thought of the person who had brought all this upon them, but after some wild and futile raving he became calm enough to recognise that his proper place was by Sylvia's side.</s> <s sid="300" id="brass.c11.s300">Perhaps he ought to have told her at first, and then she would have been less unprepared for this--and yet how could he trouble her mind so long as he could cling to the hope that the Jinnee would cease to interfere?</s> </p>

<p pid="135" id="brass.c11.p135"><s sid="301" id="brass.c11.s301">But now he could be silent no longer; naturally the prospect of calling at Cottesmore Gardens just then was anything but agreeable, but he felt it would be cowardly to keep away.</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="brass.c11.p136"><s sid="302" id="brass.c11.s302">Besides, he could cheer them up; he could bring with him a message of hope.</s> <s sid="303" id="brass.c11.s303">No doubt they believed that the Professor's transformation would be permanent--a harrowing prospect for so united a family; but, fortunately, Horace would be able to reassure them on this point.</s> </p>

<p pid="137" id="brass.c11.p137"><s sid="304" id="brass.c11.s304">Fakrash had always revoked his previous performances as soon as he could be brought to understand their fatuity--and Ventimore would take good care that he revoked this.</s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="brass.c11.p138"><s sid="305" id="brass.c11.s305">Nevertheless, it was with a sinking heart and an unsteady hand that he pulled the visitors' bell at the Futvoyes' house that afternoon, for he neither knew in what state he should find that afflicted family, nor how they would regard his intrusion at such a time.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c12.p3"><s sid="6" id="brass.c12.s6">"Not exactly out, sir," said the maid, "but particularly engaged, working hard in his study, and not to be disturbed on no account."</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c12.p4"><s sid="7" id="brass.c12.s7">This was encouraging, too, since a mule could hardly engage in literary labour of any kind.</s> <s sid="8" id="brass.c12.s8">Evidently the Jinnee must either have overrated his supernatural powers, or else have been deliberately amusing himself at Horace's expense.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c12.p5"><s sid="9" id="brass.c12.s9">"Then I will see Miss Futvoye," he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c12.p6"><s sid="10" id="brass.c12.s10">"Miss Sylvia is with the master, sir," said the girl; "but if you'll come into the drawing-room I'll let Mrs. Futvoye know you are here."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c12.p8"><s sid="13" id="brass.c12.s13">"I hardly thought we should see you to-day," she began, in a tone of studied reserve; "but perhaps you came to offer some explanation of the extraordinary manner in which you thought fit to entertain us last night?</s> <s sid="14" id="brass.c12.s14">If so----"</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c12.p9"><s sid="15" id="brass.c12.s15">"The fact is," said Horace, looking into his hat, "I came because I was rather anxious about the Professor.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c12.p12"><s sid="20" id="brass.c12.s20">"I see," said Mrs. Futvoye, regaining her composure; "you were afraid that all those foreign dishes might not have agreed with him.</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c12.s21">But--except that he is a little irritable this afternoon--he is much as usual."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c12.p18"><s sid="28" id="brass.c12.s28">"At least, I may see Sylvia?" he pleaded.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c12.p19"><s sid="29" id="brass.c12.s29">"No," said Mrs. Futvoye; "I really can't have Sylvia disturbed just now.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c12.s30">She is very busy, helping her father.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c12.s31">Anthony has to read a paper at one of his societies to-morrow night, and she is writing it out from his dictation."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c12.p20"><s sid="32" id="brass.c12.s32">If any departure from strict truth can ever be excusable, this surely was one; unfortunately, just then Sylvia herself burst into the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c12.p21"><s sid="33" id="brass.c12.s33">"Mother," she cried, without seeing Horace in her agitation, "do come to papa, quick!</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c12.s34">He has just begun kicking again, and I can't manage him alone.... Oh, _you_ here?" she broke off, as she saw who was in the room.</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c12.s35">"Why do you come here now, Horace?</s> <s sid="36" id="brass.c12.s36">Please, _please_ go away!</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c12.s37">Papa is rather unwell--nothing serious, only--oh, _do_ go away!"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c12.p22"><s sid="38" id="brass.c12.s38">"Darling!" said Horace, going to her and taking both her hands, "I know all--do you understand?--_all_!"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c12.p23"><s sid="39" id="brass.c12.s39">"Mamma!" cried Sylvia, reproachfully, "have you told him--already?</s> <s sid="40" id="brass.c12.s40">When we settled that even Horace wasn't to know till--till papa recovers!"</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c12.p24"><s sid="41" id="brass.c12.s41">"I have told him nothing, my dear," replied her mother.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c12.s42">"He can't possibly know, unless--but no, that isn't possible.</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c12.s43">And, after all," she added, with a warning glance at her daughter, "I don't know why we should make any mystery about a mere attack of gout.</s> <s sid="44" id="brass.c12.s44">But I had better go and see if your father wants anything."</s> <s sid="45" id="brass.c12.s45">And she hurried out of the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c12.p25"><s sid="46" id="brass.c12.s46">Sylvia sat down and gazed silently into the fire.</s> <s sid="47" id="brass.c12.s47">"I dare say you don't know how dreadfully people kick when they've got gout," she remarked presently.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c12.p26"><s sid="48" id="brass.c12.s48">"Oh yes, I do," said Horace, sympathetically; "at least, I can guess."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c12.p27"><s sid="49" id="brass.c12.s49">"Especially when it's in both legs," continued Sylvia.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c12.p28"><s sid="50" id="brass.c12.s50">"Or," said Horace gently, "in all four."</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c12.p29"><s sid="51" id="brass.c12.s51">"Ah, you _do_ know!" cried Sylvia.</s> <s sid="52" id="brass.c12.s52">"Then it's all the more horrid of you to come!"</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c12.p30"><s sid="53" id="brass.c12.s53">"Dearest," said Horace, "is not this just the time when my place should be near you--and him?"</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c12.p31"><s sid="54" id="brass.c12.s54">"Not near papa, Horace!" she put in anxiously; "it wouldn't be at all safe."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c12.p32"><s sid="55" id="brass.c12.s55">"Do you really think I have any fear for myself?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c12.p33"><s sid="56" id="brass.c12.s56">"Are you sure you quite know--what he is like now?"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c12.p34"><s sid="57" id="brass.c12.s57">"I understand," said Horace, trying to put it as considerately as possible, "that a casual observer, who didn't know your father, might mistake him, at first sight, for--for some sort of quadruped."</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c12.p35"><s sid="58" id="brass.c12.s58">"He's a mule," sobbed Sylvia, breaking down entirely.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c12.s59">"I could bear it better if he had been a _nice_ mule.... B--but he isn't!"</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c12.p36"><s sid="60" id="brass.c12.s60">"Whatever he may be," declared Horace, as he knelt by her chair endeavouring to comfort her, "nothing can alter my profound respect for him.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c12.s61">And you must let me see him, Sylvia; because I fully believe I shall be able to cheer him up."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c12.p37"><s sid="62" id="brass.c12.s62">"If you imagine you can persuade him to--to laugh it off!" said Sylvia, tearfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c12.p38"><s sid="63" id="brass.c12.s63">"I wasn't proposing to try to make him see the humorous side of his situation," Horace mildly explained.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c12.s64">"I trust I have more tact than that.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c12.s65">But he may be glad to know that, at the worst, it is only a temporary inconvenience.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c12.s66">I'll take care that he's all right again before very long."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c12.p39"><s sid="67" id="brass.c12.s67">She started up and looked at him, her eyes widened with dawning dread and mistrust.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c12.p40"><s sid="68" id="brass.c12.s68">"If you can speak like that," she said, "it must have been _you_ who--no, I can't believe it--that would be too horrible!"</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c12.p41"><s sid="69" id="brass.c12.s69">"I who did _what_, Sylvia?</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c12.s70">Weren't you there when--when it happened?"</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c12.p42"><s sid="71" id="brass.c12.s71">"No," she replied.</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c12.s72">"I was only told of it afterwards.</s> <s sid="73" id="brass.c12.s73">Mother heard papa talking loudly in his study this morning, as if he was angry with somebody, and at last she grew so uneasy she couldn't bear it any longer, and went in to see what was the matter with him.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c12.s74">Dad was quite alone and looked as usual, only a little excited; and then, without the slightest warning, just as she entered the room, he--he changed slowly into a mule before her eyes!</s> <s sid="75" id="brass.c12.s75">Anybody but mamma would have lost her head and roused the whole house."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c12.p43"><s sid="76" id="brass.c12.s76">"Thank Heaven she didn't!" said Horace, fervently.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c12.s77">"That was what I was most afraid of."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c12.p44"><s sid="78" id="brass.c12.s78">"Then--oh, Horace, it _was_ you!</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c12.s79">It's no use denying it.</s> <s sid="80" id="brass.c12.s80">I feel more certain of it every moment!"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c12.p45"><s sid="81" id="brass.c12.s81">"Now, Sylvia!" he protested, still anxious, if possible, to keep the worst from her, "what could have put such an idea as that into your head?"</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c12.p46"><s sid="82" id="brass.c12.s82">"I don't know," she said slowly.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c12.s83">"Several things last night.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c12.s84">No one who was really nice, and like everybody else, would live in such queer rooms like those, and dine on cushions, with dreadful black slaves, and--and dancing-girls and things.</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c12.s85">You pretended you were quite poor."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c12.p47"><s sid="86" id="brass.c12.s86">"So I am, darling.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c12.s87">And as for my rooms, and--and the rest, they're all gone, Sylvia.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c12.s88">If you went to Vincent Square to-day, you wouldn't find a trace of them!"</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c12.p48"><s sid="89" id="brass.c12.s89">"That only shows!" said Sylvia.</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c12.s90">"But why should you play such a cruel, and--and ungentlemanly trick on poor dad?</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c12.s91">If you had ever really loved me----!"</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c12.p49"><s sid="92" id="brass.c12.s92">"But I do, Sylvia, you can't really believe me capable of such an outrage!</s> <s sid="93" id="brass.c12.s93">Look at me and tell me so."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c12.p50"><s sid="94" id="brass.c12.s94">"No, Horace," said Sylvia frankly.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c12.s95">"I don't believe _you_ did it.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c12.s96">But I believe you know who _did_.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c12.s97">And you had better tell me at once!"</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c12.p51"><s sid="98" id="brass.c12.s98">"If you're quite sure you can stand it," he replied, "I'll tell you everything."</s> <s sid="99" id="brass.c12.s99">And, as briefly as possible, he told her how he had unsealed the brass bottle, and all that had come of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c12.p52"><s sid="100" id="brass.c12.s100">She bore it, on the whole, better than he had expected; perhaps, being a woman, it was some consolation to her to remind him that she had foretold something of this kind from the very first.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c12.p53"><s sid="101" id="brass.c12.s101">"But, of course, I never really thought it would be so awful as this!" she said.</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c12.s102">"Horace, how _could_ you be so careless as to let a great wicked thing like that escape out of its bottle?"</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c12.p54"><s sid="103" id="brass.c12.s103">"I had a notion it was a manuscript," said Horace--"till he came out.</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c12.s104">But he isn't a great wicked thing, Sylvia.</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c12.s105">He's an amiable old Jinnee enough.</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c12.s106">And he'd do anything for me.</s> <s sid="107" id="brass.c12.s107">Nobody could be more grateful and generous than he has been."</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c12.p55"><s sid="108" id="brass.c12.s108">"Do you call it generous to change the poor, dear dad into a mule?" inquired Sylvia, with a little curl of her upper lip.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c12.p56"><s sid="109" id="brass.c12.s109">"That was an oversight," said Horace; "he meant no harm by it.</s> <s sid="110" id="brass.c12.s110">In Arabia they do these things--or used to in his day.</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c12.s111">Not that that's much excuse for him.</s> <s sid="112" id="brass.c12.s112">Still, he's not so young as he was, and besides, being bottled up for all those centuries must have narrowed him rather.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c12.s113">You must try and make allowances for him, darling."</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c12.p57"><s sid="114" id="brass.c12.s114">"I shan't," said Sylvia, "unless he apologises to poor father, and puts him right at once."</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c12.p58"><s sid="115" id="brass.c12.s115">"Why, of course, he'll do that," Horace answered confidently.</s> <s sid="116" id="brass.c12.s116">"I'll see that he does.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c12.s117">I don't mean to stand any more of his nonsense.</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c12.s118">I'm afraid I've been just a little too slack for fear of hurting his feelings; but this time he's gone too far, and I shall talk to him like a Dutch uncle.</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c12.s119">He's always ready to do the right thing when he's once shown where he has gone wrong--only he takes such a lot of showing, poor old chap!"</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c12.p59"><s sid="120" id="brass.c12.s120">"But when do you think he'll--do the right thing?"</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c12.p60"><s sid="121" id="brass.c12.s121">"Oh, as soon as I see him again."</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c12.p61"><s sid="122" id="brass.c12.s122">"Yes; but when _will_ you see him again?"</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c12.p62"><s sid="123" id="brass.c12.s123">"That's more than I can say.</s> <s sid="124" id="brass.c12.s124">He's away just now--in China, or Peru, or somewhere."</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c12.p63"><s sid="125" id="brass.c12.s125">"Horace!</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c12.s126">Then he won't be back for months and months!"</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c12.p64"><s sid="127" id="brass.c12.s127">"Oh yes, he will.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c12.s128">He can do the whole trip, _aller et retour_, you know, in a few hours.</s> <s sid="129" id="brass.c12.s129">He's an active old beggar for his age.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c12.s130">In the meantime, dearest, the chief thing is to keep up your father's spirits.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c12.s131">So I think I'd better---- I was just telling Sylvia, Mrs. Futvoye," he said, as that lady re-entered the room, "that I should like to see the Professor at once."</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c12.p65"><s sid="132" id="brass.c12.s132">"It's quite, _quite_ impossible!" was the nervous reply.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c12.s133">"He's in such a state that he's unable to see any one.</s> <s sid="134" id="brass.c12.s134">You don't know how fractious gout makes him!"</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c12.p66"><s sid="135" id="brass.c12.s135">"Dear Mrs. Futvoye," said Horace, "believe me, I know more than you suppose."</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c12.p67"><s sid="136" id="brass.c12.s136">"Yes, mother, dear," put in Sylvia, "he knows everything--_really_ everything.</s> <s sid="137" id="brass.c12.s137">And perhaps it might do dad good to see him."</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c12.p68"><s sid="138" id="brass.c12.s138">Mrs. Futvoye sank helplessly down on a settee.</s> <s sid="139" id="brass.c12.s139">"Oh, dear me!" she said.</s> <s sid="140" id="brass.c12.s140">"I don't know _what_ to say.</s> <s sid="141" id="brass.c12.s141">I really don't.</s> <s sid="142" id="brass.c12.s142">If you had seen him plunge at the mere suggestion of a doctor!"</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c12.p69"><s sid="143" id="brass.c12.s143">Privately, though naturally he could not say so, Horace thought a vet. might be more appropriate, but eventually he persuaded Mrs. Futvoye to conduct him to her husband's study.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="brass.c12.p70"><s sid="144" id="brass.c12.s144">"Anthony, love," she said, as she knocked gently at the door, "I've brought Horace Ventimore to see you for a few moments, if he may."</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="brass.c12.p71"><s sid="145" id="brass.c12.s145">It seemed from the sounds of furious snorting and stamping within, that the Professor resented this intrusion on his privacy.</s> <s sid="146" id="brass.c12.s146">"My dear Anthony," said his devoted wife, as she unlocked the door and turned the key on the inside after admitting Horace, "try to be calm.</s> <s sid="147" id="brass.c12.s147">Think of the servants downstairs.</s> <s sid="148" id="brass.c12.s148">Horace is _so_ anxious to help."</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="brass.c12.p72"><s sid="149" id="brass.c12.s149">As for Ventimore, he was speechless--so inexpressibly shocked was he by the alteration in the Professor's appearance.</s> <s sid="150" id="brass.c12.s150">He had never seen a mule in sorrier condition or in so vicious a temper.</s> <s sid="151" id="brass.c12.s151">Most of the lighter furniture had been already reduced to matchwood; the glass doors of the bookcase were starred or shivered; precious Egyptian pottery and glass were strewn in fragments on the carpets, and even the mummy, though it still smiled with the same enigmatic cheerfulness, seemed to have suffered severely from the Professorial hoofs.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="brass.c12.p73"><s sid="152" id="brass.c12.s152">Horace instinctively felt that any words of conventional sympathy would jar here; indeed, the Professor's attitude and expression reminded him irresistibly of a certain "Blondin Donkey" he had seen enacted by music-hall artists, at the point where it becomes sullen and defiant.</s> <s sid="153" id="brass.c12.s153">Only, he had laughed helplessly at the Blondin Donkey, and somehow he felt no inclination to laugh now.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="brass.c12.p74"><s sid="154" id="brass.c12.s154">"Believe me, sir," he began, "I would not disturb you like this unless--steady there, for Heaven's sake Professor, don't kick till you've heard me out!"</s> <s sid="155" id="brass.c12.s155">For, the mule, in a clumsy, shambling way which betrayed the novice, was slowly revolving on his own axis so as to bring his hind-quarters into action, while still keeping his only serviceable eye upon his unwelcome visitor.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c12.p75"><s sid="156" id="brass.c12.s156">"Listen to me, sir," said Horace, manoeuvring in his turn.</s> <s sid="157" id="brass.c12.s157">"I'm not to blame for this, and if you brain me, as you seem to be endeavouring to do, you'll simply destroy the only living man who can get you out of this."</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="brass.c12.p76"><s sid="158" id="brass.c12.s158">The mule appeared impressed by this, and backed cumbrously into a corner, from which he regarded Horace with a mistrustful, but attentive, eye.</s> <s sid="159" id="brass.c12.s159">"If, as I imagine, sir," continued Horace, "you are, though temporarily deprived of speech, perfectly capable of following an argument, will you kindly signify it by raising your right ear?"</s> <s sid="160" id="brass.c12.s160">The mule's right ear rose with a sharp twitch.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="brass.c12.p77"><s sid="161" id="brass.c12.s161">"Now we can get on," said Horace.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c12.s162">"First let me tell you that I repudiate all responsibility for the proceedings of that infernal Jinnee.... I wouldn't stamp like that--you might go through the floor, you know.... Now, if you will only exercise a little patience----"</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="brass.c12.p78"><s sid="163" id="brass.c12.s163">At this the exasperated animal made a sudden run at him with his mouth open, which obliged Horace to shelter himself behind a large leather arm-chair.</s> <s sid="164" id="brass.c12.s164">"You really _must_ keep cool, sir," he remonstrated; "your nerves are naturally upset.</s> <s sid="165" id="brass.c12.s165">If I might suggest a little champagne--you could manage it in--in a bucket, and it would help you to pull yourself together.</s> <s sid="166" id="brass.c12.s166">A whisk of your--er--tail would imply consent."</s> <s sid="167" id="brass.c12.s167">The Professor's tail instantly swept some rare Arabian glass lamps and vases from a shelf at his rear, whereupon Mrs. Futvoye went out, and returned presently with a bottle of champagne and a large china _jardiniere_, as the best substitute she could find for a bucket.</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="brass.c12.p79"><s sid="168" id="brass.c12.s168">When the mule had drained the flower-pot greedily and appeared refreshed, Horace proceeded:</s> <s sid="169" id="brass.c12.s169">"I have every hope, sir," he said, "that before many hours you will be smiling--pray don't prance like that, I mean what I say--smiling over what now seems to you, very justly, a most annoying and serious catastrophe.</s> <s sid="170" id="brass.c12.s170">I shall speak seriously to Fakrash (the Jinnee, you know), and I am sure that, as soon as he realises what a frightful blunder he has made, he will be the first to offer you every reparation in his power.</s> <s sid="171" id="brass.c12.s171">For, old foozle as he is, he's thoroughly good-hearted."</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="brass.c12.p80"><s sid="172" id="brass.c12.s172">The Professor drooped his ears at this, and shook his head with a doleful incredulity that made him look more like the Pantomime Donkey than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="81" id="brass.c12.p81"><s sid="173" id="brass.c12.s173">"I think I understand him fairly well by this time, sir," said Horace, "and I'll answer for it that there's no real harm in him.</s> <s sid="174" id="brass.c12.s174">I give you my word of honour that, if you'll only remain quiet and leave everything to me, you shall very soon be released from this absurd position.</s> <s sid="175" id="brass.c12.s175">That's all I came to tell you, and now I won't trouble you any longer.</s> <s sid="176" id="brass.c12.s176">If you _could_ bring yourself, as a sign that you bear me no ill-feeling, to give me your--your off-foreleg at parting, I----"</s> </p>

<p pid="82" id="brass.c12.p82"><s sid="177" id="brass.c12.s177">But the Professor turned his back in so pointed and ominous a manner that Horace judged it better to withdraw without insisting further.</s> <s sid="178" id="brass.c12.s178">"I'm afraid," he said to Mrs. Futvoye, after they had rejoined Sylvia in the drawing-room--"I'm afraid your husband is still a little sore with me about this miserable business."</s> </p>

<p pid="83" id="brass.c12.p83"><s sid="179" id="brass.c12.s179">"I don't know what else you can expect," replied the lady, rather tartly; "he can't help feeling--as we all must and do, after what you said just now--that, but for you, this would never have happened!"</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="brass.c13.p71"><s sid="116" id="brass.c13.s116">"I should just like to observe," he said, as soon as he could speak, "that if we've been seen, we shall probably cause a sensation.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c13.s117">Londoners are not accustomed to seeing people skimming over the chimney-pots like amateur rooks."</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="brass.c13.p72"><s sid="118" id="brass.c13.s118">"Trouble not for that," said Fakrash, "for no mortal eyes are capable of following our flight."</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="brass.c13.p74"><s sid="123" id="brass.c13.s123">"I will bear it in mind," answered the Jinnee, and suddenly sank, or seemed to sink, through a chink in the pavement.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="brass.c13.p75"><s sid="124" id="brass.c13.s124">Horace, after ringing at the Futvoyes' door, was admitted and shown into the drawing-room, where Sylvia presently came to him, looking as lovely as ever, in spite of the pallor due to sleeplessness and anxiety.</s> <s sid="125" id="brass.c13.s125">"It is kind of you to call and inquire," she said, with the unnatural calm of suppressed hysteria.</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c13.s126">"Dad is much the same this morning.</s> <s sid="127" id="brass.c13.s127">He had a fairly good night, and was able to take part of a carrot for breakfast--but I'm afraid he has just remembered that he has to read a paper on 'Oriental Occultism' before the Asiatic Society this evening, and it's worrying him a little....

<p pid="83" id="brass.c13.p83"><s sid="152" id="brass.c13.s152">"If I must," said Sylvia, with a shudder, "I--I'll be as nice to him as I can."</s> </p>

<p pid="85" id="brass.c13.p85"><s sid="155" id="brass.c13.s155">"You are probably not aware of it, sir," said Horace, "but it is the custom here to uncover in the presence of a lady."</s> <s sid="156" id="brass.c13.s156">The Jinnee removed his hat with both hands, and stood silent and impassive.</s> </p>

<p pid="86" id="brass.c13.p86"><s sid="157" id="brass.c13.s157">"Let me present you to Miss Sylvia Futvoye," Ventimore continued, "the lady whose name you have already heard."</s> </p>

<p pid="87" id="brass.c13.p87"><s sid="158" id="brass.c13.s158">There was a momentary gleam in Fakrash's odd, slanting eyes as they lighted on Sylvia's shrinking figure, but he made no acknowledgment of the introduction.</s> </p>

<p pid="89" id="brass.c13.p89"><s sid="160" id="brass.c13.s160">"I didn't ask you for either criticisms or comparisons," said Ventimore, sharply; "there is nobody in the world equal to Miss Futvoye, in my opinion, and you will be good enough to remember that fact.</s> <s sid="161" id="brass.c13.s161">She is exceedingly distressed (as any dutiful daughter would be) by the cruel and senseless trick you have played her father, and she begs that you will rectify it at once.</s> <s sid="162" id="brass.c13.s162">Don't you, Sylvia?"</s> </p>

<p pid="90" id="brass.c13.p90"><s sid="163" id="brass.c13.s163">"Yes, indeed!" said Sylvia, almost in a whisper, "if--if it isn't troubling you too much!"</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="brass.c13.p91"><s sid="164" id="brass.c13.s164">"I have been turning over thy words in my mind," said Fakrash to Horace, still ignoring Sylvia, "and I am convinced that thou art right.</s> <s sid="165" id="brass.c13.s165">Even if the contents of the seal were known of all men, they would raise no clamour about affairs that concern them not.</s> <s sid="166" id="brass.c13.s166">Therefore it is nothing to me in whose hands the seal may be.</s> <s sid="167" id="brass.c13.s167">Dost thou not agree with me in this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="brass.c13.p92"><s sid="168" id="brass.c13.s168">"Of course I do," said Horace.</s> <s sid="169" id="brass.c13.s169">"And it naturally follows that----"</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="brass.c13.p93"><s sid="170" id="brass.c13.s170">"It naturally follows, as thou sayest," said the Jinnee, with a cunning assumption of indifference, "that I have naught to gain by demanding back the seal as the price of restoring this damsel's father to his original form.</s> <s sid="171" id="brass.c13.s171">Wherefore, so far as I am concerned, let him remain a mule for ever; unless, indeed, thou art ready to comply with my conditions."</s> </p>

<p pid="94" id="brass.c13.p94"><s sid="172" id="brass.c13.s172">"Conditions!" cried Horace, utterly unprepared for this conclusion.</s> <s sid="173" id="brass.c13.s173">"What can you possibly want from me?</s> <s sid="174" id="brass.c13.s174">But state them.</s> <s sid="175" id="brass.c13.s175">I'll agree to anything, in reason!"</s> </p>

<p pid="97" id="brass.c13.p97"><s sid="179" id="brass.c13.s179">"Maiden," said the Jinnee, addressing Sylvia for the first time, "the matter rests with thee.</s> <s sid="180" id="brass.c13.s180">Wilt thou release this my son from his contract, since thou art no fit wife for such as he?"</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="brass.c13.p98"><s sid="181" id="brass.c13.s181">"How can I," cried Sylvia, "when I love him and he loves me?</s> <s sid="182" id="brass.c13.s182">What a wicked tyrannical old thing you must be to expect it!</s> <s sid="183" id="brass.c13.s183">I _can't_ give him up."</s> </p>

<p pid="99" id="brass.c13.p99"><s sid="184" id="brass.c13.s184">"It is but giving up what can never be thine," said Fakrash.</s> <s sid="185" id="brass.c13.s185">"And be not anxious for him, for I will reward and console him a thousandfold for the loss of thy society.</s> <s sid="186" id="brass.c13.s186">A little while, and he shall remember thee no more."</s> </p>

<p pid="102" id="brass.c13.p102"><s sid="190" id="brass.c13.s190">"Oh, I couldn't!" cried Sylvia.</s> <s sid="191" id="brass.c13.s191">"I can't let poor father remain a mule all his life when one word--and yet what _am_ I to do?</s> <s sid="192" id="brass.c13.s192">Horace, what shall I say?</s> <s sid="193" id="brass.c13.s193">Advise me....

<p pid="103" id="brass.c13.p103"><s sid="194" id="brass.c13.s194">"Heaven help us both!" groaned Ventimore.</s> <s sid="195" id="brass.c13.s195">"If I could only see the right thing to do.</s> <s sid="196" id="brass.c13.s196">Look here, Mr. Fakrash," he added, "this is a matter that requires consideration.</s> <s sid="197" id="brass.c13.s197">Will you relieve us of your presence for a short time, while we talk it over?"</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="brass.c13.p104"><s sid="198" id="brass.c13.s198">"With all my heart," said the Jinnee, in the most obliging manner in the world, and vanished instantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="brass.c13.p105"><s sid="199" id="brass.c13.s199">"Now, darling," began Horace, after he had gone, "if that unspeakable old scoundrel is really in earnest, there's no denying that he's got us in an extremely tight place.</s> <s sid="200" id="brass.c13.s200">But I can't bring myself to believe that he _does_ mean it.</s> <s sid="201" id="brass.c13.s201">I fancy he's only trying us.</s> <s sid="202" id="brass.c13.s202">And what I want you to do is not to consider me in the matter at all."</s> </p>

<p pid="107" id="brass.c13.p107"><s sid="205" id="brass.c13.s205">"I?" said Horace, "when you are all I have in the world!</s> <s sid="206" id="brass.c13.s206">That's so likely, Sylvia!</s> <s sid="207" id="brass.c13.s207">But we are bound to look facts in the face.</s> <s sid="208" id="brass.c13.s208">To begin with, even if this hadn't happened, your people wouldn't let our engagement continue.</s> <s sid="209" id="brass.c13.s209">For my prospects have changed again, dearest.</s> <s sid="210" id="brass.c13.s210">I'm even worse off than when we first met, for that confounded Jinnee has contrived to lose my first and only client for me--the one thing worth having he ever gave me."</s> <s sid="211" id="brass.c13.s211">And he told her the story of the mushroom palace and Mr. Wackerbath's withdrawal.</s> <s sid="212" id="brass.c13.s212">"So you see, darling," he concluded, "I haven't even a home to offer you; and if I had, it would be miserably uncomfortable for you with that old Marplot continually dropping in on us--especially if, as I'm afraid he has, he's taken some unreasonable dislike to you."</s> </p>

<p pid="108" id="brass.c13.p108"><s sid="213" id="brass.c13.s213">"But surely you can talk him over?" said Sylvia; "you said you could do anything you liked with him."</s> </p>

<p pid="109" id="brass.c13.p109"><s sid="214" id="brass.c13.s214">"I'm beginning to find," he replied, ruefully enough, "that he's not so easily managed as I thought.</s> <s sid="215" id="brass.c13.s215">And for the present, I'm afraid, if we are to get the Professor out of this, that there's nothing for it but to humour old Fakrash."</s> </p>

<p pid="119" id="brass.c13.p119"><s sid="236" id="brass.c13.s236">"This," said Horace, "is the--er--author of the Professor's misfortunes, and he had come here at my request to undo his work."</s> </p>

<p pid="120" id="brass.c13.p120"><s sid="237" id="brass.c13.s237">"It _would_ be so kind of him!" exclaimed the distressed lady, who was by this time far beyond either surprise or resentment.</s> <s sid="238" id="brass.c13.s238">"I'm sure, if he knew all we have gone through----!" and she led the way to her husband's room.</s> </p>

<p pid="121" id="brass.c13.p121"><s sid="239" id="brass.c13.s239">As soon as the door was opened the Professor seemed to recognise his tormentor in spite of his changed raiment, and was so powerfully agitated that he actually reeled on his four legs, and "stood over" in a lamentable fashion.</s> </p>

<p pid="122" id="brass.c13.p122"><s sid="240" id="brass.c13.s240">"O man of distinguished attainments!" began the Jinnee, "whom I have caused, for reasons that are known unto thee, to assume the shape of a mule, speak, I adjure thee, and tell me where thou hast deposited the inscribed seal which is in thy possession."</s> </p>

<p pid="123" id="brass.c13.p123"><s sid="241" id="brass.c13.s241">The Professor spoke; and the effect of articulate speech proceeding from the mouth of what was to all outward seeming an ordinary mule was strange beyond description.</s> <s sid="242" id="brass.c13.s242">"I'll see you damned first," he said sullenly.</s> <s sid="243" id="brass.c13.s243">"You can't do worse to me than you've done already!"</s> </p>

<p pid="126" id="brass.c13.p126"><s sid="246" id="brass.c13.s246">The Jinnee unlocked the drawer, and took out the metal cap, which he placed in the breast pocket of his incongruous frock-coat.</s> <s sid="247" id="brass.c13.s247">"So far, well," he said; "next thou must deliver up to me the transcription thou hast made, and swear to preserve an inviolable secrecy regarding the meaning thereof."</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="brass.c13.p136"><s sid="266" id="brass.c13.s266">"Do as you're told, my dear!" snapped the ungrateful mule; "do as you're told.</s> <s sid="267" id="brass.c13.s267">You'll only be in the way here.</s> <s sid="268" id="brass.c13.s268">Do you suppose he doesn't know his own beastly business?"</s> </p>

<p pid="137" id="brass.c13.p137"><s sid="269" id="brass.c13.s269">They left accordingly; whereupon Fakrash took the cup--an ordinary breakfast cup with a Greek key-border pattern in pale blue round the top--and, drenching the mule with the contents, exclaimed, "Quit this form and return to the form in which thou wast!"</s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="brass.c13.p138"><s sid="270" id="brass.c13.s270">For a dreadful moment or two it seemed as if no effect was to be produced; the animal simply stood and shivered, and Ventimore began to feel an agonising suspicion that the Jinnee really had, as he had first asserted, forgotten how to perform this particular incantation.</s> </p>

<p pid="139" id="brass.c13.p139"><s sid="271" id="brass.c13.s271">All at once the mule reared, and began to beat the air frantically with his fore-hoofs; after which he fell heavily backward into the nearest armchair (which was, fortunately, a solid and capacious piece of furniture) with his fore-legs hanging limply at his side, in a semi-human fashion.</s> <s sid="272" id="brass.c13.s272">There was a brief convulsion, and then, by some gradual process unspeakably impressive to witness, the man seemed to break through the mule, the mule became merged in the man--and Professor Futvoye, restored to his own natural form and habit, sat gasping and trembling in the chair before them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="brass.c14.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c14.s1">As soon as the Professor seemed to have regained his faculties, Horace opened the door and called in Sylvia and her mother, who were, as was only to be expected, overcome with joy on seeing the head of the family released from his ignoble condition of a singularly ill-favoured quadruped.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c14.p2"><s sid="2" id="brass.c14.s2">"There, there," said the Professor, as he submitted to their embraces and incoherent congratulations, "it's nothing to make a fuss about.</s> <s sid="3" id="brass.c14.s3">I'm quite myself again, as you can see.</s> <s sid="4" id="brass.c14.s4">And," he added, with an unreasonable outburst of ill-temper, "if one of you had only had the common sense to think of such a simple remedy as sprinkling a little cold water over me when I was first taken like that, I should have been spared a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c14.s5">But that's always the way with women--lose their heads the moment anything goes wrong!</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c14.s6">If I had not kept perfectly cool myself--"</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c14.p3"><s sid="7" id="brass.c14.s7">"It was very, very stupid of us not to think of it, papa," said Sylvia, tactfully ignoring the fact that there was scarcely an undamaged article in the room; "still, you know, if _we_ had thrown the water it mightn't have had the same effect."</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c14.p4"><s sid="8" id="brass.c14.s8">"I'm not in a condition to argue now," said her father; "you didn't trouble to try it, and there's no more to be said."</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c14.p6"><s sid="11" id="brass.c14.s11">"As I am already indebted to you, sir," said the Professor, "for about twenty-four hours of the most poignant and humiliating mental and bodily anguish a human being can endure, inflicted for no valid reason that I can discover, except the wanton indulgence of your unholy powers, I can only say that any gratitude of which I am conscious is of a very qualified description.</s> <s sid="12" id="brass.c14.s12">As for you, Ventimore," he added, turning to Horace, "I don't know--I can only guess at--the part you have played in this wretched business; but in any case you will understand, once for all, that all relations between us must cease."</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c14.p7"><s sid="13" id="brass.c14.s13">"Papa," said Sylvia, tremulously, "Horace and I have already agreed that--that we must separate."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c14.p11"><s sid="19" id="brass.c14.s19">"Excellent is the saying," remarked the imperturbable Jinnee, "'Let the rat that is between the paws of the leopard observe rigidly all the rules of politeness and refrain from words of provocation.'</s> <s sid="20" id="brass.c14.s20">For to return thee to the form of a mule once more would be no difficult undertaking."</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c14.p12"><s sid="21" id="brass.c14.s21">"I think I failed to make myself clear," the Professor hastened to observe--"failed to make myself clear.</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c14.s22">I--I merely meant to congratulate you on your fortunate escape from the consequences of what I--I don't doubt was an error of justice.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c14.s23">I--I am sure that, in the future, you will employ your--your very remarkable abilities to better purpose, and I would suggest that the greatest service you can do this unfortunate young man here is to abstain from any further attempts to promote his interests."</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c14.p14"><s sid="26" id="brass.c14.s26">"Far be this from me," replied Fakrash.</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c14.s27">"For he has become unto me even as a favourite son, whom I design to place upon the golden pinnacle of felicity.</s> <s sid="28" id="brass.c14.s28">Therefore, I have chosen for him a wife, who is unto this damsel of thine as the full moon to the glow-worm, and as the bird of Paradise to an unfledged sparrow.</s> <s sid="29" id="brass.c14.s29">And the nuptials shall be celebrated before many hours."</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c14.p15"><s sid="30" id="brass.c14.s30">"Horace!" cried Sylvia, justly incensed, "why--_why_ didn't you tell me this before?"</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c14.p16"><s sid="31" id="brass.c14.s31">"Because," said the unhappy Horace, "this is the very first I've heard of it.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c14.s32">He's always springing some fresh surprise on me," he added, in a whisper--"but they never come to anything much.</s> <s sid="33" id="brass.c14.s33">And he can't marry me against my will, you know."</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c14.p17"><s sid="34" id="brass.c14.s34">"No," said Sylvia, biting her lip.</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c14.s35">"I never supposed he could do that, Horace."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c14.p18"><s sid="36" id="brass.c14.s36">"I'll settle this at once," he replied.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c14.s37">"Now, look here, Mr. Jinnee," he added, "I don't know what new scheme you have got in your head--but if you are proposing to marry me to anybody in particular----"</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c14.p19"><s sid="38" id="brass.c14.s38">"Have I not informed thee that I have it in contemplation to obtain for thee the hand of a King's daughter of marvellous beauty and accomplishments?"</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c14.p20"><s sid="39" id="brass.c14.s39">"You know perfectly well you never mentioned it before," said Horace, while Sylvia gave a little low cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c14.p21"><s sid="40" id="brass.c14.s40">"Repine not, O damsel," counselled the Jinnee, "since it is for his welfare.</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c14.s41">For, though as yet he believeth it not, when he beholds the resplendent beauty of her countenance he will swoon away with delight and forget thy very existence."</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c14.p22"><s sid="42" id="brass.c14.s42">"I shall do nothing of the sort," said Horace, savagely.</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c14.s43">"Just understand that I don't intend to marry any Princess.</s> <s sid="44" id="brass.c14.s44">You may prevent me--in fact, you _have_--from marrying this lady, but you can't force me to marry anybody else.</s> <s sid="45" id="brass.c14.s45">I defy you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c14.p23"><s sid="46" id="brass.c14.s46">"When thou hast seen thy bride's perfections thou wilt need no compulsion," said Fakrash.</s> <s sid="47" id="brass.c14.s47">"And if thou shouldst refuse, know this: that thou wilt be exposing those who are dear to thee in this household to calamities of the most unfortunate description."</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c14.p24"><s sid="48" id="brass.c14.s48">The awful vagueness of this threat completely crushed Horace; he could not think, he did not even dare to imagine, what consequences he might bring upon his beloved Sylvia and her helpless parents by persisting in his refusal.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c14.p25"><s sid="49" id="brass.c14.s49">"Give me time," he said heavily; "I want to talk this over with you."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c14.p26"><s sid="50" id="brass.c14.s50">"Pardon me, Ventimore," said the Professor, with acidulous politeness; "but, interesting as the discussion of your matrimonial arrangements is to you and your--a--protector, I should greatly prefer that you choose some more fitting place for arriving at a decision which is in the circumstances a foregone conclusion.</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c14.s51">I am rather tired and upset, and I should be obliged if you and this gentleman could bring this most trying interview to a close as soon as you conveniently can."</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c14.p27"><s sid="52" id="brass.c14.s52">"You hear, Mr. Fakrash?" said Horace, between his teeth, "it is quite time we left.</s> <s sid="53" id="brass.c14.s53">If you go at once, I will follow you very shortly."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c14.p28"><s sid="54" id="brass.c14.s54">"Thou wilt find me awaiting thee," answered the Jinnee, and, to Mrs. Futvoye's and Sylvia's alarm, disappeared through one of the bookcases.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c14.p29"><s sid="55" id="brass.c14.s55">"Well," said Horace, gloomily, "you see how I'm situated?</s> <s sid="56" id="brass.c14.s56">That obstinate old devil has cornered me.</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c14.s57">I'm done for!"</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c14.p30"><s sid="58" id="brass.c14.s58">"Don't say that," said the Professor; "you appear to be on the eve of a most brilliant alliance, in which I am sure you have our best wishes--the best wishes of us all," he added pointedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c14.p31"><s sid="59" id="brass.c14.s59">"Sylvia," said Horace, still lingering, "before I go, tell me that, whatever I may have to do, you will understand that--that it will be for your sake!"</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c14.p32"><s sid="60" id="brass.c14.s60">"Please don't talk like that," she said.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c14.s61">"We may never see one another again.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c14.s62">Don't let my last recollection of you be of--of a hypocrite, Horace!"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c14.p33"><s sid="63" id="brass.c14.s63">"A hypocrite!" he cried.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c14.s64">"Sylvia, this is too much!</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c14.s65">What have I said or done to make you think me that?"</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c14.p34"><s sid="66" id="brass.c14.s66">"Oh, I am not so simple as you suppose, Horace," she replied.</s> <s sid="67" id="brass.c14.s67">"I see now why all this has happened: why poor dad was tormented; why you insisted on my setting you free.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c14.s68">But I would have released you without _that_!</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c14.s69">Indeed, all this elaborate artifice wasn't in the least necessary!"</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c14.p35"><s sid="70" id="brass.c14.s70">"You believe I was an accomplice in that old fool's plot?" he said.</s> <s sid="71" id="brass.c14.s71">"You believe me such a cur as that?"</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c14.p36"><s sid="72" id="brass.c14.s72">"I don't blame you," she said.</s> <s sid="73" id="brass.c14.s73">"I don't believe you could help yourself.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c14.s74">He can make you do whatever he chooses.</s> <s sid="75" id="brass.c14.s75">And then, you are so rich now, it is natural that you should want to marry some one--some one more suited to you--like this lovely Princess of yours."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c14.p37"><s sid="76" id="brass.c14.s76">"Of mine!" groaned the exasperated Horace.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c14.s77">"When I tell you I've never even seen her!</s> <s sid="78" id="brass.c14.s78">As if any Princess in the world would marry me to please a Jinnee out of a brass bottle!</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c14.s79">And if she did, Sylvia, you can't believe that any Princess would make me forget you!"</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c14.p38"><s sid="80" id="brass.c14.s80">"It depends so very much on the Princess," was all Sylvia could be induced to say.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c14.p39"><s sid="81" id="brass.c14.s81">"Well," said Horace, "if that's all the faith you have in me, I suppose it's useless to say any more.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c14.s82">Good-bye, Mrs. Futvoye; good-bye, Professor.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c14.s83">I wish I could tell you how deeply I regret all the trouble I have brought on you by my own folly.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c14.s84">All I can say is, that I will bear anything in future rather than expose you or any of you to the smallest risk."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c14.p40"><s sid="85" id="brass.c14.s85">"I trust, indeed," said the Professor, stiffly, "that you will use all the influence at your command to secure me from any repetition of an experience that might well have unmanned a less equable temperament than my own."</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c14.p41"><s sid="86" id="brass.c14.s86">"Good-bye, Horace," said Mrs. Futvoye, more kindly.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c14.s87">"I believe you are more to be pitied than blamed, whatever others may think.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c14.s88">And _I_ don't forget--if Anthony does--that, but for you, he might, instead of sitting there comfortably in his armchair, be lashing out with his hind legs and kicking everything to pieces at this very moment!"</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c14.p42"><s sid="89" id="brass.c14.s89">"I deny that I lashed out!" said the Professor.</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c14.s90">"My--a--hind quarters may have been under imperfect control--but I never lost my reasoning powers or my good humour for a single instant.</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c14.s91">I can say that truthfully."</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c14.p43"><s sid="92" id="brass.c14.s92">If the Professor could say that truthfully amidst the general wreck in which he sat, like another Marius, he had little to learn in the gentle art of self-deception; but there was nothing to gain by contradicting him then.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c14.p44"><s sid="93" id="brass.c14.s93">"Good-bye, Sylvia," said Horace, and held out his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c14.p45"><s sid="94" id="brass.c14.s94">"Good-bye," she said, without offering to take it or look at him--and, after a miserable pause, he left the study.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c14.s95">But before he had reached the front door he heard a swish and swirl of drapery behind him, and felt her light hand on his arm.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c14.s96">"Ah, no!" she said, clinging to him, "I can't let you go like this.</s> <s sid="97" id="brass.c14.s97">I didn't mean all the things I said just now.</s> <s sid="98" id="brass.c14.s98">I _do_ believe in you, Horace--at least, I'll try hard to....

<p pid="46" id="brass.c14.p46"><s sid="100" id="brass.c14.s100">"I shall _not_ be too happy," he said, as he held her close to his heart and kissed her pathetically drawn mouth and flushed cheeks.</s> <s sid="101" id="brass.c14.s101">"And I shall think of you always."</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c14.p47"><s sid="102" id="brass.c14.s102">"And you won't fall in love with your Princess?" entreated Sylvia, at the end of her altruism.</s> <s sid="103" id="brass.c14.s103">"Promise!"</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c14.p48"><s sid="104" id="brass.c14.s104">"If I am ever provided with one," he replied, "I shall loathe her--for not being you.</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c14.s105">But don't let us lose heart, darling.</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c14.s106">There must be some way of talking that old idiot out of this nonsense and bringing him round to common sense.</s> <s sid="107" id="brass.c14.s107">I'm not going to give in just yet!"</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c14.p49"><s sid="108" id="brass.c14.s108">These were brave words--but, as they both felt, the situation had little enough to warrant them, and, after one last long embrace, they parted, and he was no sooner on the steps than he felt himself caught up as before and borne through the air with breathless speed, till he was set down, he could not have well said how, in a chair in his own sitting-room at Vincent Square.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c14.p50"><s sid="109" id="brass.c14.s109">"Well," he said, looking at the Jinnee, who was standing opposite with a smile of intolerable complacency, "I suppose you feel satisfied with yourself over this business?"</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="brass.c14.p51"><s sid="110" id="brass.c14.s110">"It hath indeed been brought to a favourable conclusion," said Fakrash.</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c14.s111">"Well hath the poet written----"</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c14.p52"><s sid="112" id="brass.c14.s112">"I don't think I can stand any more 'Elegant Extracts' this afternoon," interrupted Horace.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c14.s113">"Let us come to business.</s> <s sid="114" id="brass.c14.s114">You seem," he went on, with a strong effort to keep himself in hand, "to have formed some plan for marrying me to a King's daughter.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c14.s115">May I ask you for full particulars?"</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c14.p53"><s sid="116" id="brass.c14.s116">"No honour and advancement can be in excess of thy deserts," answered the Jinnee.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c14.p54"><s sid="117" id="brass.c14.s117">"Very kind of you to say so--but you are probably unaware that, as society is constituted at the present time, the objections to such an alliance would be quite insuperable."</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c14.p55"><s sid="118" id="brass.c14.s118">"For me," said the Jinnee, "few obstacles are insuperable.</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c14.s119">But speak thy mind freely."</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c14.p56"><s sid="120" id="brass.c14.s120">"I will," said Horace.</s> <s sid="121" id="brass.c14.s121">"To begin with, no European Princess of the Blood Royal would entertain the idea for a moment.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c14.s122">And if she did, she would forfeit her rank and cease to be a Princess, and I should probably be imprisoned in a fortress for _lese majeste_ or something."</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c14.p59"><s sid="127" id="brass.c14.s127">"Her nose," recited the Jinnee, with enthusiasm, "is like unto the keen edge of a polished sword; her hair resembleth jewels, and her cheeks are ruddy as wine.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c14.s128">She hath heavy lips, and when she looketh aside she putteth to shame the wild cows...."</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c14.p60"><s sid="129" id="brass.c14.s129">"My good, excellent friend," said Horace, by no means impressed by this catalogue of charms, "one doesn't marry to mortify wild cows."</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="brass.c14.p92"><s sid="187" id="brass.c14.s187">"What thou hast just said is not altogether without wisdom," said Fakrash, to whom this was evidently a new point of view.</s> <s sid="188" id="brass.c14.s188">"Art thou, indeed, so utterly unknown?"</s> </p>

<p pid="93" id="brass.c14.p93"><s sid="189" id="brass.c14.s189">"Unknown?" repeated Horace; "I should rather think I was!</s> <s sid="190" id="brass.c14.s190">I'm simply an inconsiderable unit in the population of the vastest city in the world; or, rather, not a unit--a cipher.</s> <s sid="191" id="brass.c14.s191">And, don't you see, a man to be worthy of your exalted kinswoman ought to be a celebrity.</s> <s sid="192" id="brass.c14.s192">There are plenty of them about."</s> </p>

<p pid="104" id="brass.c14.p104"><s sid="229" id="brass.c14.s229">He read on till he reached the memorable encounter between the King's daughter and Jarjarees, who presented himself "in a most hideous shape, with hands like winnowing forks, and legs like masts, and eyes like burning torches"--which was calculated to unnerve the stoutest novice.</s> <s sid="230" id="brass.c14.s230">The Efreet began by transforming himself from a lion to a scorpion, upon which the Princess became a serpent; then he changed to an eagle, and she to a vulture; he to a black cat, and she to a cock; he to a fish, and she to a larger fish still.</s> </p>

<p pid="105" id="brass.c14.p105"><s sid="231" id="brass.c14.s231">"If Fakrash can shove me through all that without a fatal hitch somewhere," Ventimore told himself, "I shall be agreeably disappointed in him," But, after reading a few more lines, he cheered up.</s> <s sid="232" id="brass.c14.s232">For the Efreet finished as a flame, and the Princess as a "body of fire."</s> <s sid="233" id="brass.c14.s233">"And when we looked towards him," continued the narrator, "we perceived that he had become a heap of ashes."</s> </p>

<p pid="114" id="brass.c14.p114"><s sid="250" id="brass.c14.s250">"If that means anything at all," he reasoned, "it means that Seyf and Bedeea are both deceased.</s> <s sid="251" id="brass.c14.s251">Even Jinneeyeh seem to be mortal.</s> <s sid="252" id="brass.c14.s252">Or perhaps she became so by marrying a mortal; I dare say that Fakrash himself wouldn't have lasted all this time if he hadn't been bottled, like a tinned tomato.</s> <s sid="253" id="brass.c14.s253">But I'm glad I found this out, because Fakrash is evidently unaware of it, and, if he _should_ persist in any more of this nonsense, I think I see my way now to getting the better of him."</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c15.p8"><s sid="18" id="brass.c15.s18">"It is agreed," said Fakrash, "for I am confident that Bedeea will accept thee joyfully."</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c15.p9"><s sid="19" id="brass.c15.s19">"We shall see," said Horace.</s> <s sid="20" id="brass.c15.s20">"But it might be as well if you went and prepared her a little.</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c15.s21">I suppose you know where to find her--and you've only twenty-four hours, you know."</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c15.p10"><s sid="22" id="brass.c15.s22">"More than is needed," answered the Jinnee, with such childlike confidence, that Horace felt almost ashamed of so easy a victory.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c15.s23">"But the sun is already high.</s> <s sid="24" id="brass.c15.s24">Arise, my son, put on these robes"--and with this he flung on the bed the magnificent raiment which Ventimore had last worn on the night of his disastrous entertainment--"and when thou hast broken thy fast, prepare to accompany me."</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c15.p11"><s sid="25" id="brass.c15.s25">"Before I agree to that," said Horace, sitting up in bed, "I should like to know where you're taking me to."</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c15.p13"><s sid="27" id="brass.c15.s27">It seemed to Horace that it was as well to humour him, and he got up accordingly, washed and shaved, and, putting on his dazzling robe of cloth-of-gold thickly sewn with gems, he joined Fakrash--who, by the way, was similarly, if less gorgeously, arrayed--in the sitting-room, in a state of some mystification.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c15.p14"><s sid="28" id="brass.c15.s28">"Eat quickly," commanded the Jinnee, "for the time is short."</s> <s sid="29" id="brass.c15.s29">And Horace, after hastily disposing of a cold poached egg and a cup of coffee, happened to go to the windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c15.p17"><s sid="36" id="brass.c15.s36">"It belongs to thee," said the Jinnee; "descend then, and make thy progress in it through the City."</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c15.p18"><s sid="37" id="brass.c15.s37">"I will not," said Horace.</s> <s sid="38" id="brass.c15.s38">"Even to oblige you I simply can't drive along the streets in a thing like the band-chariot of a travelling circus."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c15.p20"><s sid="41" id="brass.c15.s41">"Oh, very well," said Horace, irritably.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c15.s42">"If you insist on my making a fool of myself, I suppose I must.</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c15.s43">But where am I to drive, and why?"</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c15.p21"><s sid="44" id="brass.c15.s44">"That," replied Fakrash, "thou shalt discover at the fitting moment."</s> <s sid="45" id="brass.c15.s45">And so, amidst the shouts of the spectators, Ventimore climbed up into the strange-looking vehicle, while the Jinnee took his seat by his side.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c15.s46">Horace had a parting glimpse of Mr. and Mrs. Rapkin's respective noses flattened against the basement window, and then two dusky slaves mounted to a seat at the back of the chariot, and the horses started off at a stately trot in the direction of Rochester Row.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c15.p22"><s sid="47" id="brass.c15.s47">"I think you might tell me what all this means," he said.</s> <s sid="48" id="brass.c15.s48">"You've no conception what an ass I feel, stuck up here like this!"</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c15.p23"><s sid="49" id="brass.c15.s49">"Dismiss bashfulness from thee, since all this is designed to render thee more acceptable in the eyes of the Princess Bedeea," said the Jinnee.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c15.p24"><s sid="50" id="brass.c15.s50">Horace said no more, though he could not but think that this parade would be thrown away.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c15.p25"><s sid="51" id="brass.c15.s51">But as they turned into Victoria Street and seemed to be heading straight for the Abbey, a horrible thought occurred to him.</s> <s sid="52" id="brass.c15.s52">After all, his only authority for the marriage and decease of Bedeea was the "Arabian Nights," which was not unimpeachable evidence.</s> <s sid="53" id="brass.c15.s53">What if she were alive and waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom?</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c15.s54">No one but Fakrash would have conceived such an idea as marrying him to a Jinneeyeh in Westminster Abbey; but he was capable of any extravagance, and there were apparently no limits to his power.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c15.p26"><s sid="55" id="brass.c15.s55">"Mr. Fakrash," he said hoarsely, "surely this isn't my--my wedding day?</s> <s sid="56" id="brass.c15.s56">You're not going to have the ceremony _there_?"</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c15.p27"><s sid="57" id="brass.c15.s57">"Nay," said the Jinnee, "be not impatient.</s> <s sid="58" id="brass.c15.s58">For this edifice would be totally unfitted for the celebration of such nuptials as thine."</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c15.p28"><s sid="59" id="brass.c15.s59">As he spoke, the chariot left the Abbey on the right and turned down the Embankment.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c15.s60">The relief was so intense that Horace's spirits rose irrepressibly.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c15.s61">It was absurd to suppose that even Fakrash could have arranged the ceremony in so short a time.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c15.s62">He was merely being taken for a drive, and fortunately his best friends could not recognise him in his Oriental disguise.</s> <s sid="63" id="brass.c15.s63">And it was a glorious morning, with a touch of frost in the air and a sky of streaky turquoise and pale golden clouds; the broad river glittered in the sunshine; the pavements were lined with admiring crowds, and the carriage rolled on amidst frantic enthusiasm, like some triumphal car.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c15.p29"><s sid="64" id="brass.c15.s64">"How they're cheering us!" said Horace.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c15.s65">"Why, they couldn't make more row for the Lord Mayor himself."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c15.p30"><s sid="66" id="brass.c15.s66">"What is this Lord Mayor of whom thou speakest?" inquired Fakrash.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c15.p31"><s sid="67" id="brass.c15.s67">"The Lord Mayor?" said Horace.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c15.s68">"Oh, he's unique.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c15.s69">There's nobody in the world quite like him.</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c15.s70">He administers the law, and if there's any distress in any part of the earth he relieves it.</s> <s sid="71" id="brass.c15.s71">He entertains monarchs and Princes and all kinds of potentates at his banquets, and altogether he's a tremendous swell."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c15.p32"><s sid="72" id="brass.c15.s72">"Hath he dominion over the earth and the air and all that is therein?"</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c15.p33"><s sid="73" id="brass.c15.s73">"Within his own precincts, I believe he has," said Horace, rather lazily, "but I really don't know precisely how wide his powers are."</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c15.s74">He was vainly trying to recollect whether such matters as sky-signs, telephones, and telegraphs in the City were within the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction or the County Council's.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c15.p34"><s sid="75" id="brass.c15.s75">Fakrash remained silent just as they were driving underneath Charing Cross Railway Bridge, when he started perceptibly at the thunder of the trains overhead and the piercing whistles of the engines.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c15.s76">"Tell me," he said, clutching Horace by the arm, "what meaneth this?"</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c15.p35"><s sid="77" id="brass.c15.s77">"You don't mean to say," said Horace, "that you have been about London all these days, and never noticed things like these before?"</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c15.p36"><s sid="78" id="brass.c15.s78">"Till now," said the Jinnee, "I have had no leisure to observe them and discover their nature."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c15.p37"><s sid="79" id="brass.c15.s79">"Well," said Horace, anxious to let the Jinnee see that he had not the monopoly of miracles, "since your days we have discovered how to tame or chain the great forces of Nature and compel them to do our will.</s> <s sid="80" id="brass.c15.s80">We control the Spirits of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and make them give us light and heat, carry our messages, fight our quarrels for us, transport us wherever we wish to go, with a certainty and precision that throw even your performances, my dear sir, entirely into the shade."</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c15.p38"><s sid="81" id="brass.c15.s81">Considering what a very large majority of civilised persons would be as powerless to construct the most elementary machine as to create the humblest kind of horse, it is not a little odd how complacently we credit ourselves with all the latest achievements of our generation.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c15.s82">Most of us accept the amazement of the simple-minded barbarian on his first introduction to modern inventions as a gratifying personal tribute: we feel a certain superiority, even if we magnanimously refrain from boastfulness.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c15.s83">And yet our own particular share in these discoveries is limited to making use of them under expert guidance, which any barbarian, after overcoming his first terror, is quite as competent to do as we are.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c15.p39"><s sid="84" id="brass.c15.s84">It is a harmless vanity enough, and especially pardonable in Ventimore's case, when it was so desirable to correct any tendency to "uppishness" on the part of the Jinnee.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c15.p40"><s sid="85" id="brass.c15.s85">"And doth the Lord Mayor dispose of these forces at his will?" inquired Fakrash, on whom Ventimore's explanation had evidently produced some impression.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c15.p41"><s sid="86" id="brass.c15.s86">"Certainly," said Horace; "whenever he has occasion."</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c15.p42"><s sid="87" id="brass.c15.s87">The Jinnee seemed engrossed in his own thoughts, for he said no more just then.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c15.p43"><s sid="88" id="brass.c15.s88">They were now nearing St.</s> <s sid="89" id="brass.c15.s89">Paul's Cathedral, and Horace's first suspicion returned with double force.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c15.p44"><s sid="90" id="brass.c15.s90">"Mr. Fakrash, answer me," he said.</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c15.s91">"Is this my wedding day or not?</s> <s sid="92" id="brass.c15.s92">If it is, it's time I was told!"</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c15.p45"><s sid="93" id="brass.c15.s93">"Not yet," said the Jinnee, enigmatically, and indeed it proved to be another false alarm, for they turned down Cannon Street and towards the Mansion House.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c15.p46"><s sid="94" id="brass.c15.s94">"Perhaps you can tell me why we're going through Victoria Street, and what all this crowd has come out for?" asked Ventimore.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c15.s95">For the throng was denser than ever; the people surged and swayed in serried ranks behind the City police, and gazed with a wonder and awe that for once seemed to have entirely silenced the Cockney instinct of _persiflage_.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c15.p47"><s sid="96" id="brass.c15.s96">"For what else but to do thee honour?" answered Fakrash.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c15.p48"><s sid="97" id="brass.c15.s97">"What bosh!" said Horace.</s> <s sid="98" id="brass.c15.s98">"They mistake me for the Shah or somebody--and no wonder, in this get-up."</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c15.p49"><s sid="99" id="brass.c15.s99">"Not so," said the Jinnee.</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c15.s100">"Thy names are familiar to them."</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="brass.c15.p50"><s sid="101" id="brass.c15.s101">Horace glanced up at the hastily improvised decorations; on one large strip of bunting which spanned the street he read:</s> <s sid="102" id="brass.c15.s102">"Welcome to the City's most distinguished guest!"</s> <s sid="103" id="brass.c15.s103">"They can't mean me," he thought; and then another legend caught his eye:</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c15.s104">"Well done, Ventimore!"</s> <s sid="105" id="brass.c15.s105">And an enthusiastic householder next door had burst into poetry and displayed the couplet--</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="brass.c15.p52"><s sid="107" id="brass.c15.s107">"They _do_ mean me!" he exclaimed.</s> <s sid="108" id="brass.c15.s108">"Now, Mr. Fakrash, _will_ you kindly explain what tomfoolery you've been up to now?</s> <s sid="109" id="brass.c15.s109">I know you're at the bottom of this business."</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="brass.c15.p53"><s sid="110" id="brass.c15.s110">It struck him that the Jinnee was slightly embarrassed.</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c15.s111">"Didst thou not say," he replied, "that he who should receive the freedom of the City from his fellow-men would be worthy of Bedeea-el-Jemal?"</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="brass.c15.p54"><s sid="112" id="brass.c15.s112">"I may have said something of the sort.</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c15.s113">But, good heavens! you don't mean that you have contrived that _I_ should receive the freedom of the City?"</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="brass.c15.p55"><s sid="114" id="brass.c15.s114">"It was the easiest affair possible," said the Jinnee, but he did not attempt to meet Horace's eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="brass.c15.p56"><s sid="115" id="brass.c15.s115">"Was it, though?" said Horace, in a white rage.</s> <s sid="116" id="brass.c15.s116">"I don't want to be inquisitive, but I should like to know what I've done to deserve it?"</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="brass.c15.p57"><s sid="117" id="brass.c15.s117">"Why trouble thyself with the reason?</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c15.s118">Let it suffice thee that such honour is bestowed upon thee."</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="brass.c15.p58"><s sid="119" id="brass.c15.s119">By this time the chariot had crossed Cheapside and was entering King Street.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="brass.c15.p59"><s sid="120" id="brass.c15.s120">"This really won't do!" urged Horace.</s> <s sid="121" id="brass.c15.s121">"It's not fair to me.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c15.s122">Either I've done something, or you must have made the Corporation _believe_ I've done something, to be received like this.</s> <s sid="123" id="brass.c15.s123">And, as we shall be in the Guildhall in a very few seconds, you may as well tell me what it is!"</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="brass.c15.p60"><s sid="124" id="brass.c15.s124">"Regarding that matter," replied the Jinnee, in some confusion, "I am truly as ignorant as thyself."</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="brass.c15.p61"><s sid="125" id="brass.c15.s125">As he spoke they drove through some temporary wooden gates into the courtyard, where the Honourable Artillery Company presented arms to them, and the carriage drew up before a large marquee decorated with shields and clustered banners.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="brass.c15.p62"><s sid="126" id="brass.c15.s126">"Well, Mr. Fakrash," said Horace, with suppressed fury, as he alighted, "you have surpassed yourself this time.</s> <s sid="127" id="brass.c15.s127">You've got me into a nice scrape, and you'll have to pull me through it as well as you can."</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="brass.c15.p63"><s sid="128" id="brass.c15.s128">"Have no uneasiness," said the Jinnee, as he accompanied his _protege_ into the marquee, which was brilliant with pretty women in smart frocks, officers in scarlet tunics and plumed hats, and servants in State liveries.</s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="brass.c15.p64"><s sid="129" id="brass.c15.s129">Their entrance was greeted by a politely-subdued buzz of applause and admiration, and an official, who introduced himself as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick-makers' Company, advanced to meet them.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c15.s130">"The Lord Mayor will receive you in the library," he said.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c15.s131">"If you will have the kindness to follow me----"</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="brass.c15.p65"><s sid="132" id="brass.c15.s132">Horace followed him mechanically.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c15.s133">"I'm in for it now," he thought, "whatever it is.</s> <s sid="134" id="brass.c15.s134">If I can only trust Fakrash to back me up--but I'm hanged if I don't believe he's more nervous than I am!"</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="brass.c15.p66"><s sid="135" id="brass.c15.s135">As they came into the noble Library of the Guildhall a fine string band struck up, and Horace, with the Jinnee in his rear, made his way through a lane of distinguished spectators towards a dais, on the steps of which, in his gold-trimmed robes and black-feather hat, stood the Lord Mayor, with his sword and mace-bearers on either hand, and behind him a row of beaming sheriffs.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="brass.c15.p67"><s sid="136" id="brass.c15.s136">A truly stately and imposing figure did the Chief Magistrate for that particular year present: tall, dignified, with a lofty forehead whose polished temples reflected the light, an aquiline nose, and piercing black eyes under heavy white eyebrows, a frosty pink in his wrinkled cheeks, and a flowing silver beard with a touch of gold still lingering under the lower lip: he seemed, as he stood there, a worthy representative of the greatest and richest city in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="brass.c15.p68"><s sid="137" id="brass.c15.s137">Horace approached the steps with an unpleasant sensation of weakness at the knees, and no sort of idea what he was expected to do or say when he arrived.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="brass.c15.p69"><s sid="138" id="brass.c15.s138">And, in his perplexity, he turned for support and guidance to his self-constituted mentor--only to discover that the Jinnee, whose short-sightedness and ignorance had planted him in this present false position, had mysteriously and perfidiously disappeared, and left him to grapple with the situation single-handed.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c16.p15"><s sid="23" id="brass.c16.s23">"Very," said Horace, guiltily, and not a little concerned on the official's account.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c16.p16"><s sid="24" id="brass.c16.s24">"A mere form!" said the Lord Mayor; "but I for one, Mr. Ventimore--I for one should be sorry to see the picturesque old practices die out.</s> <s sid="25" id="brass.c16.s25">To my mind," he added, as he finished a _pate de foie gras_ sandwich, "the modern impatience to sweep away all the ancient landmarks (whether they be superannuated or not) is one of the most disquieting symptoms of the age.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c16.s26">You won't have any more champagne?</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c16.s27">Then I think we had better be making our way to the Great Hall for the Event of the Day."</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c16.p20"><s sid="35" id="brass.c16.s35">The Hall was crowded, and Ventimore found himself the object of a popular demonstration which would have filled him with joy and pride if he could only have felt that he had done anything whatever to justify it, for it was ridiculous to suppose that he had rendered himself a public benefactor by restoring a convicted Jinnee to freedom and society generally.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c16.p21"><s sid="36" id="brass.c16.s36">His only consolation was that the English are a race not given to effusiveness without very good reason, and that before the ceremony was over he would be enabled to gather what were the particular services which had excited such unbounded enthusiasm.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c16.p23"><s sid="41" id="brass.c16.s41">At length the proceedings began by a sort of solemn affectation of having merely met there for the ordinary business of the day, which to Horace just then seemed childish in the extreme; it was resolved that "items 1 to 4 on the agenda need not be discussed," which brought them to item 5.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c16.p24"><s sid="42" id="brass.c16.s42">Item 5 was a resolution, read by the Town Clerk, that "the freedom of the City should be presented to Horace Ventimore, Esq., Citizen and Candlestick-maker" (which last Horace was not aware of being, but supposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the buffet in the Library), "in recognition of his services"--the resolution ran, and Horace listened with all his ears--"especially in connection with ..." It was most unfortunate--but at this precise point the official was seized with an attack of coughing, in which all was lost but the conclusion of the sentence, " ... that have justly entitled him to the gratitude and admiration of his fellow-countrymen."</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c16.p26"><s sid="45" id="brass.c16.s45">After this the City Chamberlain read him an address, to which Horace listened in resigned bewilderment.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c16.s46">The Chamberlain referred to the unanimity and enthusiasm with which the resolution had been carried, and said that it was his pleasing and honourable duty, as the mouthpiece of that ancient City, to address what he described with some inadequacy as "a few words" to one by adding whose name to their roll of freemen the Corporation honoured rather themselves than the recipient of their homage.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c16.p27"><s sid="47" id="brass.c16.s47">It was flattering, but to Horace's ear the phrases sounded excessive, almost fulsome--though, of course, that depended very much on what he had done, which he had still to ascertain.</s> <s sid="48" id="brass.c16.s48">The orator proceeded to read him the "Illustrious List of London's Roll of Fame," a recital which made Horace shiver with apprehension.</s> <s sid="49" id="brass.c16.s49">For what names they were!</s> <s sid="50" id="brass.c16.s50">What glorious deeds they had performed!</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c16.s51">How was it possible that he--plain Horace Ventimore, a struggling architect who had missed his one great chance--could have achieved (especially without even being aware of it) anything that would not seem ludicrously insignificant by comparison?</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c16.p28"><s sid="52" id="brass.c16.s52">He had a morbid fancy that the marble goddesses, or whoever they were, at the base of Nelson's monument opposite, were regarding him with stony disdain and indignation; that the statue of Wellington knew him for an arrant impostor, and averted his head with cold contempt; and that the effigy of Lord Mayor Beckford on the right of the dais would come to life and denounce him in another moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c16.p29"><s sid="53" id="brass.c16.s53">"Turning now to your own distinguished services," he suddenly heard the City Chamberlain resuming, "you are probably aware, sir, that it is customary on these occasions to mention specifically the particular merit which had been deemed worthy of civic recognition."</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c16.p30"><s sid="54" id="brass.c16.s54">Horace was greatly relieved to hear it, for it struck him as a most sensible and, in his own particular case, essential formality.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c16.p31"><s sid="55" id="brass.c16.s55">"But, on the present occasion, sir," proceeded the speaker, "I feel, as all present must feel, that it would be unnecessary--nay, almost impertinent--were I to weary the public ear by a halting recapitulation of deeds with which it is already so appreciatively familiar."</s> <s sid="56" id="brass.c16.s56">At this he was interrupted by deafening and long-continued applause, at the end of which he continued:</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c16.s57">"I have only therefore, to greet you in the name of the Corporation, and to offer you the right hand of fellowship as a Freeman, and Citizen, and Candlestick-maker of London."</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c16.p32"><s sid="58" id="brass.c16.s58">As he shook hands he presented Horace with a copy of the Oath of Allegiance, intimating that he was to read it aloud.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c16.s59">Naturally, Ventimore had not the least objection to swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria, or to be obedient to the Lord Mayor, and warn him of any conspiracies against the Queen's peace which might chance to come under his observation; so he took the oath cheerfully enough, and hoped that this was really the end of the ceremony.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c16.p33"><s sid="60" id="brass.c16.s60">However, to his great chagrin and apprehension, the Lord Mayor rose with the evident intention of making a speech.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c16.s61">He said that the conclusion of the City to bestow the highest honour in their gift upon Mr. Horace Ventimore had been--here he hesitated--somewhat hastily arrived at.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c16.s62">Personally, he would have liked a longer time to prepare, to make the display less inadequate to, and worthier of, this exceptional occasion.</s> <s sid="63" id="brass.c16.s63">He thought that was the general feeling.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c16.s64">(It evidently was, judging from the loud and unanimous cheering).</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c16.s65">However, for reasons which--for reasons with which they were as well acquainted as himself, the notice had been short.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c16.s66">The Corporation had yielded (as they always did, as it would always be their pride and pleasure to yield) to popular pressure which was practically irresistible, and had done the best they could in the limited--he might almost say the unprecedentedly limited--period allowed them.</s> <s sid="67" id="brass.c16.s67">The proudest leaf in Mr. Ventimore's chaplet of laurels to-day was, he would venture to assert, the sight of the extraordinary enthusiasm and assemblage, not only in that noble hall, but in the thoroughfares of this mighty Metropolis.</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c16.s68">Under the circumstances, this was a marvellous tribute to the admiration and affection which Mr. Ventimore had succeeded in inspiring in the great heart of the people, rich and poor, high and low.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c16.s69">He would not detain his hearers any longer; all that remained for him to do was to ask Mr. Ventimore's acceptance of a golden casket containing the roll of freedom, and he felt sure that their distinguished guest, before proceeding to inscribe his name on the register, would oblige them all by some account from his own lips of--of the events in which he had figured so prominently and so creditably.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c16.p34"><s sid="70" id="brass.c16.s70">Horace received the casket mechanically; there was a universal cry of "Speech!" from the audience, to which he replied by shaking his head in helpless deprecation--but in vain; he found himself irresistibly pressed towards the rail in front of the dais, and the roar of applause which greeted him saved him from all necessity of attempting to speak for nearly two minutes.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c16.p35"><s sid="71" id="brass.c16.s71">During that interval he had time to clear his brain and think what he had better do or say in his present unenviable dilemma.</s> <s sid="72" id="brass.c16.s72">For some time past a suspicion had been growing in his mind, until it had now almost swollen into certainty.</s> <s sid="73" id="brass.c16.s73">He felt that, before he compromised himself, or allowed his too generous entertainers to compromise themselves irretrievably, it was absolutely necessary to ascertain his real position, and, to do that, he must make some sort of speech.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c16.s74">With this resolve, all his nervousness and embarrassment and indecision melted away; he faced the assembly coolly and gallantly, convinced that his best alternative now lay in perfect candour.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c16.p36"><s sid="75" id="brass.c16.s75">"My Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen," he began, in a clear voice which penetrated to the farthest gallery and commanded instant attention.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c16.s76">"If you expect to hear from me any description of what I've done to be received like this, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c16.s77">For my own belief is that I've done nothing whatever."</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c16.p37"><s sid="78" id="brass.c16.s78">There was a general outcry of "No, no!" at this, and a fervid murmur of protest.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c16.p38"><s sid="79" id="brass.c16.s79">"It's all very well to say 'No, no,'" said Horace, "and I am extremely grateful to you all for the interruption.</s> <s sid="80" id="brass.c16.s80">Still, I can only repeat that I am absolutely unaware of having ever rendered my Country, or this great City, a single service deserving of the slightest acknowledgment.</s> <s sid="81" id="brass.c16.s81">I wish I could feel I had--but the truth is that, if I have, the fact has entirely slipped from my memory."</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c16.p39"><s sid="82" id="brass.c16.s82">Again there were murmurs, this time with a certain under-current of irritation; and he could hear the Lord Mayor behind him remarking to the City Chamberlain that this was not at all the kind of speech for the occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c16.p40"><s sid="83" id="brass.c16.s83">"I know what you're thinking," said Horace.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c16.s84">"You're thinking this is mock modesty on my part.</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c16.s85">But it's nothing of the sort.</s> <s sid="86" id="brass.c16.s86">_I_ don't know what I've done--but I presume you are all better informed.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c16.s87">Because the Corporation wouldn't have given me that very charming casket--you wouldn't all of you be here like this--unless you were under a strong impression that I'd done _something_ to deserve it."</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c16.s88">At this there was a fresh outburst of applause.</s> <s sid="89" id="brass.c16.s89">"Just so," said Horace, calmly.</s> <s sid="90" id="brass.c16.s90">"Well, now, will any of you be kind enough to tell me, in a few words, _what_ you suppose I've done?"</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c16.p41"><s sid="91" id="brass.c16.s91">There was a dead silence, in which every one looked at his or her neighbour and smiled feebly.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c16.p42"><s sid="92" id="brass.c16.s92">"My Lord Mayor," continued Horace, "I appeal to you to tell me and this distinguished assembly why on earth we're all here!"</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c16.p43"><s sid="93" id="brass.c16.s93">The Lord Mayor rose.</s> <s sid="94" id="brass.c16.s94">"I think it sufficient to say," he announced with dignity, "that the Corporation and myself were unanimously of opinion that this distinction should be awarded--for reasons which it is unnecessary and--hum--ha--invidious to enter into here."</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c16.p44"><s sid="95" id="brass.c16.s95">"I am sorry," persisted Horace, "but I must press your lordship for those reasons.</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c16.s96">I have an object....

<p pid="45" id="brass.c16.p45"><s sid="105" id="brass.c16.s105">There was a breathless hush upon this; the silence grew so intense that to borrow a slightly involved metaphor from a distinguished friend of the writer's, you might have picked up a pin in it!</s> <s sid="106" id="brass.c16.s106">Horace leaned sideways against the rail in an easy attitude, so as to face the Lord Mayor, as well as a portion of his audience.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c17.p3"><s sid="7" id="brass.c17.s7">Many feet beneath him spread the dull, leaden summit of the dome, its raised ridges stretching, like huge serpents over the curve, beyond which was a glimpse of the green roof of the nave and the two west towers, with their grey columns and urn-topped buttresses and gilded pineapples, which shone ruddily in the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c17.p4"><s sid="8" id="brass.c17.s8">He had an impression of Ludgate Hill and Fleet Street as a deep, winding ravine, steeped in partial shadow; of long sierras of roofs and chimney-pots, showing their sharp outlines above mouse-coloured smoke-wreaths; of the broad, pearl-tinted river, with oily ripples and a golden glitter where the sunlight touched it; of the gleaming slope of mud under the wharves and warehouses on the Surrey side; of barges and steamers moored in black clusters; of a small tug fussing noisily down the river, leaving a broadening arrow-head in its wake.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c17.p5"><s sid="9" id="brass.c17.s9">Cautiously he moved round towards the east, where the houses formed a blurred mosaic of cream, slate, indigo, and dull reds and browns, above which slender rose-flushed spires and towers pierced the haze, stained in countless places by pillars of black, grey, and amber smoke, and lightened by plumes and jets of silvery steam, till all blended by imperceptible gradations into a sky of tenderest gold slashed with translucent blue.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c17.p6"><s sid="10" id="brass.c17.s10">It was a magnificent view, and none the less so because the indistinctness of all beyond a limited radius made the huge City seem not only mystical, but absolutely boundless in extent.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c17.s11">But although Ventimore was distinctly conscious of all this, he was scarcely in a state to appreciate its grandeur just then.</s> <s sid="12" id="brass.c17.s12">He was much too concerned with wondering why Fakrash had chosen to plant him up there in so insecure a position, and how he was ever to be rescued from it, since the Jinnee had apparently disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c17.p7"><s sid="13" id="brass.c17.s13">He was not far off, however, for presently Horace saw him stalk round the narrow cornice with an air of being perfectly at home on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c17.p9"><s sid="16" id="brass.c17.s16">"Because I desired to have speech with thee in private," replied the Jinnee.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c17.p18"><s sid="36" id="brass.c17.s36">"What doth it signify why the whole populace should come forth to acclaim thee and do thee honour, so long as they did so?" said Fakrash, sullenly.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c17.s37">"For the report of thy fame would reach Bedeea-el-Jemal."</s> </p>

<p pid="79" id="brass.c17.p79"><s sid="193" id="brass.c17.s193">Horace determined to make one last appeal to Fakrash's sense of gratitude, since it had always seemed the dominant trait in his character.</s> </p>

<p pid="144" id="brass.c18.p144"><s sid="310" id="brass.c18.s310">And yet, in the very moment of triumph, quixotic as such scruples may seem to some, Ventimore's conscience smote him.</s> <s sid="311" id="brass.c18.s311">He could not help a certain pity for the old creature, who was shaking there convulsively prepared to re-enter his bottle-prison rather than incur a wholly imaginary doom.</s> <s sid="312" id="brass.c18.s312">Fakrash had aged visibly within the last hour; now he looked even older than his three thousand and odd years.</s> <s sid="313" id="brass.c18.s313">True, he had led Horace a fearful life of late, but at first, at least, his intentions had been good.</s> <s sid="314" id="brass.c18.s314">His gratitude, if mistaken in its form, was the sign of a generous disposition.</s> <s sid="315" id="brass.c18.s315">Not every Jinnee, surely, would have endeavoured to press untold millions and honours and dignities of all kinds upon him, in return for a service which most mortals would have considered amply repaid by a brace of birds and an invitation to an evening party.</s> </p>

<p pid="153" id="brass.c18.p153"><s sid="335" id="brass.c18.s335">Accordingly, he made a rush for the jar and slipped the metal cover over the mouth of the neck, which was so hot that it blistered his fingers, and, seizing the poker, he hammered down the secret catch until the lid fitted as closely as Suleyman himself could have required.</s> </p>

<p pid="154" id="brass.c18.p154"><s sid="336" id="brass.c18.s336">Then he stuffed the bottle into a kit-bag, adding a few coals to give it extra weight, and toiled off with it to the nearest steamboat pier, where he spent his remaining pence in purchasing a ticket to the Temple.</s> </p>

<p pid="174" id="brass.c18.p174"><s sid="388" id="brass.c18.s388">"Why, do you mean to say you've forgotten how you went to that auction for papa, and came away without having managed to get a single thing?" she said.</s> <s sid="389" id="brass.c18.s389">"What a short memory you must have!"</s> </p>

<p pid="175" id="brass.c18.p175"><s sid="390" id="brass.c18.s390">There was only tender mockery in her eyes; absolutely no recollection of the sinister purchase he had made at that sale, or how nearly it had separated them for ever.</s> <s sid="391" id="brass.c18.s391">So he hastened to admit that perhaps he had _not_ been particularly successful at the auction in question.</s> </p>

<p pid="176" id="brass.c18.p176"><s sid="392" id="brass.c18.s392">Sir Lawrence next addressed him across the table.</s> <s sid="393" id="brass.c18.s393">"I was just telling Mrs. Futvoye," he said, "how much I regretted that I had not the privilege of your acquaintance during my year of office.</s> <s sid="394" id="brass.c18.s394">A Lord Mayor, as you doubtless know, has exceptional facilities for exercising hospitality, and it would have afforded me real pleasure if your first visit to the Guildhall could have been paid under my--hm--ha--auspices."</s> </p>

<p pid="177" id="brass.c18.p177"><s sid="395" id="brass.c18.s395">"You are very kind," said Horace, very much on his guard; "I could not wish to pay it under better."</s> </p>

<p pid="178" id="brass.c18.p178"><s sid="396" id="brass.c18.s396">"I flatter myself," said the ex-Lord Mayor, "that, while in office, I did my humble best to maintain the traditions of the City, and I was fortunate enough to have the honour of receiving more than the average number of celebrities as guests.</s> <s sid="397" id="brass.c18.s397">But I had one great disappointment, I must tell you.</s> <s sid="398" id="brass.c18.s398">It had always been a dream of mine that it might fall to my lot to present some distinguished fellow-countryman with the freedom of the City.</s> <s sid="399" id="brass.c18.s399">By some curious chance, when the opportunity seemed about to occur, the thing was put off and I missed it--missed it by the nearest hair-breadth!"</s> </p>

<p pid="179" id="brass.c18.p179"><s sid="400" id="brass.c18.s400">"Ah, well, Sir Lawrence," said Ventimore, "one can't have _everything_!"</s> </p>

<p pid="180" id="brass.c18.p180"><s sid="401" id="brass.c18.s401">"For my part," put in Lady Pountney, who had only caught a word or two of her husband's remarks, "what _I_ miss most is having the sentinels present arms whenever I went out for a drive.</s> <s sid="402" id="brass.c18.s402">They did it so nicely and respectfully.</s> <s sid="403" id="brass.c18.s403">I confess I enjoyed that.</s> <s sid="404" id="brass.c18.s404">My husband never cared much for it.</s> <s sid="405" id="brass.c18.s405">Indeed, he wouldn't even use the State coach unless he was absolutely obliged.</s> <s sid="406" id="brass.c18.s406">He was as obstinate as a mule about it!"</s> </p>

<p pid="181" id="brass.c18.p181"><s sid="407" id="brass.c18.s407">"I see, Lady Pountney," the Professor put in, "that you share the common prejudice against mules.</s> <s sid="408" id="brass.c18.s408">It's quite a mistaken one.</s> <s sid="409" id="brass.c18.s409">The mule has never been properly appreciated in this country.</s> <s sid="410" id="brass.c18.s410">He is really the gentlest and most docile of creatures!"</s> </p>

<p pid="182" id="brass.c18.p182"><s sid="411" id="brass.c18.s411">"I can't say I like them myself," said Lady Pountney; "such a mongrel sort of animal--neither one thing nor the other!"</s> </p>

<p pid="183" id="brass.c18.p183"><s sid="412" id="brass.c18.s412">"And they're hideous too, Anthony," added his wife.</s> <s sid="413" id="brass.c18.s413">"And not at all clever!"</s> </p>

<p pid="184" id="brass.c18.p184"><s sid="414" id="brass.c18.s414">"There you're mistaken, my dear," said the Professor; "they are capable of almost human intelligence.</s> <s sid="415" id="brass.c18.s415">I have had considerable personal experience of what a mule can do," he informed Lady Pountney, who seemed still incredulous.</s> <s sid="416" id="brass.c18.s416">"More than most people indeed, and I can assure you, my dear Lady Pountney, that they readily adapt themselves to almost any environment, and will endure the greatest hardships without exhibiting any signs of distress.</s> <s sid="417" id="brass.c18.s417">I see by your expression, Ventimore, that you don't agree with me, eh?"</s> </p>

<p pid="185" id="brass.c18.p185"><s sid="418" id="brass.c18.s418">Horace had to set his teeth hard for a moment, lest he should disgrace himself by a peal of untimely mirth--but by a strong effort of will he managed to command his muscles.</s> </p>

<p pid="186" id="brass.c18.p186"><s sid="419" id="brass.c18.s419">"Well, sir," he said, "I've only chanced to come into close contact with one mule in my life, and, frankly, I've no desire to repeat the experience."</s> </p>

<p pid="187" id="brass.c18.p187"><s sid="420" id="brass.c18.s420">"You happened to come upon an unfavourable specimen, that's all," said the Professor.</s> <s sid="421" id="brass.c18.s421">"There are exceptions to every rule."</s> </p>

<p pid="188" id="brass.c18.p188"><s sid="422" id="brass.c18.s422">"This animal," Horace said, "was certainly exceptional enough in every way."</s> </p>

<p pid="189" id="brass.c18.p189"><s sid="423" id="brass.c18.s423">"Do tell us all about it," pleaded one of the Miss Wackerbaths, and all the ladies joined in the entreaty until Horace found himself under the necessity of improvising a story, which, it must be confessed, fell exceedingly flat.</s> </p>

<p pid="190" id="brass.c18.p190"><s sid="424" id="brass.c18.s424">This final ordeal past, he grew silent and thoughtful, as he sat there by Sylvia's side, looking out through the glazed gallery outside upon the spring foliage along the Embankment, the opaline river, and the shot towers and buildings on the opposite bank glowing warm brown against an evening sky of silvery blue.</s> </p>

<p pid="191" id="brass.c18.p191"><s sid="425" id="brass.c18.s425">Not for the first time did it seem strange, incredible almost, to him that all these people should be so utterly without any recollection of events which surely might have been expected to leave some trace upon the least retentive memory--and yet it only proved once more how thoroughly and honourably the old Jinnee, now slumbering placidly in his bottle deep down in unfathomable mud, opposite the very spot where they were dining, had fulfilled his last undertaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="192" id="brass.c18.p192"><s sid="426" id="brass.c18.s426">Fakrash, the brass bottle, and all the fantastic and embarrassing performances were indeed as totally forgotten as though they had never been.</s> </p>
