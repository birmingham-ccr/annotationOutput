<title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="duke.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="duke.c1.s1">On a bright autumn day, as long ago as the year 943, there was a great bustle in the Castle of Bayeux in Normandy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="duke.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="duke.c1.s2">The hall was large and low, the roof arched, and supported on thick short columns, almost like the crypt of a Cathedral; the walls were thick, and the windows, which had no glass, were very small, set in such a depth of wall that there was a wide deep window seat, upon which the rain might beat, without reaching the interior of the room.</s> <s sid="3" id="duke.c1.s3">And even if it had come in, there was nothing for it to hurt, for the walls were of rough stone, and the floor of tiles.</s> <s sid="4" id="duke.c1.s4">There was a fire at each end of this great dark apartment, but there were no chimneys over the ample hearths, and the smoke curled about in thick white folds in the vaulted roof, adding to the wreaths of soot, which made the hall look still darker.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="duke.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="duke.c1.s5">The fire at the lower end was by far the largest and hottest.</s> <s sid="6" id="duke.c1.s6">Great black cauldrons hung over it, and servants, both men and women, with red faces, bare and grimed arms, and long iron hooks, or pots and pans, were busied around it.</s> <s sid="7" id="duke.c1.s7">At the other end, which was raised about three steps above the floor of the hall, other servants were engaged.</s> <s sid="8" id="duke.c1.s8">Two young maidens were strewing fresh rushes on the floor; some men were setting up a long table of rough boards, supported on trestles, and then ranging upon it silver cups, drinking horns, and wooden trenchers.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="duke.c1.p4"><s sid="9" id="duke.c1.s9">Benches were placed to receive most of the guests, but in the middle, at the place of honour, was a high chair with very thick crossing legs, and the arms curiously carved with lions' faces and claws; a clumsy wooden footstool was set in front, and the silver drinking-cup on the table was of far more beautiful workmanship than the others, richly chased with vine leaves and grapes, and figures of little boys with goats' legs.</s> <s sid="10" id="duke.c1.s10">If that cup could have told its story, it would have been a strange one, for it had been made long since, in the old Roman times, and been carried off from Italy by some Northman pirate.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="duke.c1.p5"><s sid="11" id="duke.c1.s11">From one of these scenes of activity to the other, there moved a stately old lady: her long thick light hair, hardly touched with grey, was bound round her head, under a tall white cap, with a band passing under her chin: she wore a long sweeping dark robe, with wide hanging sleeves, and thick gold ear-rings and necklace, which had possibly come from the same quarter as the cup.</s> <s sid="12" id="duke.c1.s12">She directed the servants, inspected both the cookery and arrangements of the table, held council with an old steward, now and then looked rather anxiously from the window, as if expecting some one, and began to say something about fears that these loitering youths would not bring home the venison in time for Duke William's supper.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="duke.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="duke.c1.s13">Presently, she looked up rejoiced, for a few notes of a bugle-horn were sounded; there was a clattering of feet, and in a few moments there bounded into the hall, a boy of about eight years old, his cheeks and large blue eyes bright with air and exercise, and his long light-brown hair streaming behind him, as he ran forward flourishing a bow in his hand, and crying out, <qs/>"I hit him, I hit him!</s> <s sid="14" id="duke.c1.s14">Dame Astrida, do you hear?</s> <s sid="15" id="duke.c1.s15">'Tis a stag of ten branches, and I hit him in the neck."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="duke.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="duke.c1.s16"><qs/>"You! my Lord Richard! you killed him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="duke.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="duke.c1.s17"><qs/>"Oh, no, I only struck him.</s> <s sid="18" id="duke.c1.s18">It was Osmond's shaft that took him in the eye, and--Look you, Fru Astrida, he came thus through the wood, and I stood here, it might be, under the great elm with my bow thus"<qe/><sls/>--And Richard was beginning to act over again the whole scene of the deer-hunt, but Fru, that is to say, Lady Astrida, was too busy to listen, and broke in with, <sle/><qs/>"Have they brought home the haunch?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="duke.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="duke.c1.s19"><qs/>"Yes, Walter is bringing it.</s> <s sid="20" id="duke.c1.s20">I had a long arrow--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="duke.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="duke.c1.s22">A stout forester was at this instant seen bringing in the venison, and Dame Astrida hastened to meet it, and gave directions, little Richard following her all the way, and talking as eagerly as if she was attending to him, showing how he shot, how Osmond shot, how the deer bounded, and how it fell, and then counting the branches of its antlers, always ending with, <qs/>"This is something to tell my father.</s> <s sid="23" id="duke.c1.s23">Do you think he will come soon?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="duke.c1.p12"><s sid="24" id="duke.c1.s24">In the meantime two men entered the hall, one about fifty, the other, one or two-and-twenty, both in hunting dresses of plain leather, crossed by broad embroidered belts, supporting a knife, and a bugle-horn.</s> <s sid="25" id="duke.c1.s25">The elder was broad-shouldered, sun-burnt, ruddy, and rather stern-looking; the younger, who was also the taller, was slightly made, and very active, with a bright keen grey eye, and merry smile.</s> <s sid="26" id="duke.c1.s26">These were Dame Astrida's son, Sir Eric de Centeville, and her grandson, Osmond; and to their care Duke William of Normandy had committed his only child, Richard, to be fostered, or brought up.</s> <s sid="27" id="duke.c1.s27">{1}</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="duke.c1.p13"><s sid="28" id="duke.c1.s28">It was always the custom among the Northmen, that young princes should thus be put under the care of some trusty vassal, instead of being brought up at home, and one reason why the Centevilles had been chosen by Duke William was, that both Sir Eric and his mother spoke only the old Norwegian tongue, which he wished young Richard to understand well, whereas, in other parts of the Duchy, the Normans had forgotten their own tongue, and had taken up what was then called the Langued'oui, a language between German and Latin, which was the beginning of French.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="duke.c1.p14"><s sid="29" id="duke.c1.s29">On this day, Duke William himself was expected at Bayeux, to pay a visit to his son before setting out on a journey to settle the disputes between the Counts of Flanders and Montreuil, and this was the reason of Fru Astrida's great preparations.</s> <s sid="30" id="duke.c1.s30">No sooner had she seen the haunch placed upon a spit, which a little boy was to turn before the fire, than she turned to dress something else, namely, the young Prince Richard himself, whom she led off to one of the upper rooms, and there he had full time to talk, while she, great lady though she was, herself combed smooth his long flowing curls, and fastened his short scarlet cloth tunic, which just reached to his knee, leaving his neck, arms, and legs bare.</s> <s sid="31" id="duke.c1.s31">He begged hard to be allowed to wear a short, beautifully ornamented dagger at his belt, but this Fru Astrida would not allow.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="duke.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="duke.c1.s32"><qs/>"You will have enough to do with steel and dagger before your life is at an end,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"without seeking to begin over soon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="duke.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="duke.c1.s33"><qs/>"To be sure I shall,"<qe/> answered Richard.</s> <s sid="34" id="duke.c1.s34"><qs/>"I will be called Richard of the Sharp Axe, or the Bold Spirit, I promise you, Fru Astrida.</s> <s sid="35" id="duke.c1.s35">We are as brave in these days as the Sigurds and Ragnars you sing of!</s> <s sid="36" id="duke.c1.s36">I only wish there were serpents and dragons to slay here in Normandy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="duke.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="duke.c1.s37"><qs/>"Never fear but you will find even too many of them,"<qe/><sss/> said Dame Astrida; <sse/><qs/>"there be dragons of wrong here and everywhere, quite as venomous as any in my Sagas."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="duke.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="duke.c1.s38"><qs/>"I fear them not,"<qe/><sls/> said Richard, but half understanding her, <sle/><qs/>"if you would only let me have the dagger!</s> <s sid="39" id="duke.c1.s39">But, hark! hark!"<qe/> he darted to the window.</s> <s sid="40" id="duke.c1.s40"><qs/>"They come, they come!</s> <s sid="41" id="duke.c1.s41">There is the banner of Normandy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="duke.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="duke.c1.s42">Away ran the happy child, and never rested till he stood at the bottom of the long, steep, stone stair, leading to the embattled porch.</s> <s sid="43" id="duke.c1.s43">Thither came the Baron de Centeville, and his son, to receive their Prince.</s> <s sid="44" id="duke.c1.s44">Richard looked up at Osmond, saying, <qs/>"Let me hold his stirrup,"<qe/> and then sprang up and shouted for joy, as under the arched gateway there came a tall black horse, bearing the stately form of the Duke of Normandy.</s> <s sid="45" id="duke.c1.s45">His purple robe was fastened round him by a rich belt, sustaining the mighty weapon, from which he was called <qs/>"William of the long Sword,"<qe/> his legs and feet were cased in linked steel chain-work, his gilded spurs were on his heels, and his short brown hair was covered by his ducal cap of purple, turned up with fur, and a feather fastened in by a jewelled clasp.</s> <s sid="46" id="duke.c1.s46">His brow was grave and thoughtful, and there was something both of dignity and sorrow in his face, at the first moment of looking at it, recalling the recollection that he had early lost his young wife, the Duchess Emma, and that he was beset by many cares and toils; but the next glance generally conveyed encouragement, so full of mildness were his eyes, and so kind the expression of his lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="duke.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="duke.c1.s47">And now, how bright a smile beamed upon the little Richard, who, for the first time, paid him the duty of a pupil in chivalry, by holding the stirrup while he sprung from his horse.</s> <s sid="48" id="duke.c1.s48">Next, Richard knelt to receive his blessing, which was always the custom when children met their parents.</s> <s sid="49" id="duke.c1.s49">The Duke laid his hand on his head, saying, <qs/>"God of His mercy bless thee, my son,"<qe/> and lifting him in his arms, held him to his breast, and let him cling to his neck and kiss him again and again, before setting him down, while Sir Eric came forward, bent his knee, kissed the hand of his Prince, and welcomed him to his Castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="duke.c1.p21"><s sid="50" id="duke.c1.s50">It would take too long to tell all the friendly and courteous words that were spoken, the greeting of the Duke and the noble old Lady Astrida, and the reception of the Barons who had come in the train of their Lord.</s> <s sid="51" id="duke.c1.s51">Richard was bidden to greet them, but, though he held out his hand as desired, he shrank a little to his father's side, gazing at them in dread and shyness.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="duke.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="duke.c1.s52">There was Count Bernard, of Harcourt, called the <qs/>"Dane,"<qe/> {2} with his shaggy red hair and beard, to which a touch of grey had given a strange unnatural tint, his eyes looking fierce and wild under his thick eyebrows, one of them mis-shapen in consequence of a sword cut, which had left a broad red and purple scar across both cheek and forehead.</s> <s sid="53" id="duke.c1.s53">There, too, came tall Baron Rainulf, of Ferrieres, cased in a linked steel hauberk, that rang as he walked, and the men-at-arms, with helmets and shields, looking as if Sir Eric's armour that hung in the hail had come to life and was walking about.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="duke.c1.p23"><s sid="54" id="duke.c1.s54">They sat down to Fru Astrida's banquet, the old Lady at the Duke's right hand, and the Count of Harcourt on his left; Osmond carved for the Duke, and Richard handed his cup and trencher.</s> <s sid="55" id="duke.c1.s55">All through the meal, the Duke and his Lords talked earnestly of the expedition on which they were bound to meet Count Arnulf of Flanders, on a little islet in the river Somme, there to come to some agreement, by which Arnulf might make restitution to Count Herluin of Montreuil, for certain wrongs which he had done him.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="duke.c1.p24"><s sid="56" id="duke.c1.s56">Some said that this would be the fittest time for requiring Arnulf to yield up some towns on his borders, to which Normandy had long laid claim, but the Duke shook his head, saying that he must seek no selfish advantage, when called to judge between others.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="duke.c1.p25"><s sid="57" id="duke.c1.s57">Richard was rather tired of their grave talk, and thought the supper very long; but at last it was over, the Grace was said, the boards which had served for tables were removed, and as it was still light, some of the guests went to see how their steeds had been bestowed, others to look at Sir Eric's horses and hounds, and others collected together in groups.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="duke.c1.p26"><s sid="58" id="duke.c1.s58">The Duke had time to attend to his little boy, and Richard sat upon his knee and talked, told about all his pleasures, how his arrow had hit the deer to-day, how Sir Eric let him ride out to the chase on his little pony, how Osmond would take him to bathe in the cool bright river, and how he had watched the raven's nest in the top of the old tower.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="duke.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="duke.c1.s59">Duke William listened, and smiled, and seemed as well pleased to hear as the boy was to tell.</s> <s sid="60" id="duke.c1.s60"><qs/>"And, Richard,"<qe/><sss/> said he at last, <sse/><qs/>"have you nought to tell me of Father Lucas, and his great book?</s> <s sid="61" id="duke.c1.s61">What, not a word?</s> <s sid="62" id="duke.c1.s62">Look up, Richard, and tell me how it goes with the learning."<qe/></s> <s sid="63" id="duke.c1.s63">{3}</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="duke.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="duke.c1.s64"><qs/>"Oh, father!"<qe/><sls/> said Richard, in a low voice, playing with the clasp of his father's belt, and looking down, <sle/><qs/>"I don't like those crabbed letters on the old yellow parchment."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="duke.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="duke.c1.s65"><qs/>"But you try to learn them, I hope!"<qe/> said the Duke.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="duke.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="duke.c1.s66"><qs/>"Yes, father, I do, but they are very hard, and the words are so long, and Father Lucas will always come when the sun is so bright, and the wood so green, that I know not how to bear to be kept poring over those black hooks and strokes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="duke.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="duke.c1.s67"><qs/>"Poor little fellow,"<qe/> said Duke William, smiling and Richard, rather encouraged, went on more boldly.</s> <s sid="68" id="duke.c1.s68"><qs/>"You do not know this reading, noble father?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="duke.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="duke.c1.s69"><qs/>"To my sorrow, no,"<qe/> said the Duke.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="duke.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="duke.c1.s70"><qs/>"And Sir Eric cannot read, nor Osmond, nor any one, and why must I read, and cramp my fingers with writing, just as if I was a clerk, instead of a young Duke?"<qe/></s> <s sid="71" id="duke.c1.s71">Richard looked up in his father's face, and then hung his head, as if half-ashamed of questioning his will, but the Duke answered him without displeasure.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="duke.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="duke.c1.s72"><qs/>"It is hard, no doubt, my boy, to you now, but it will be the better for you in the end.</s> <s sid="73" id="duke.c1.s73">I would give much to be able myself to read those holy books which I must now only hear read to me by a clerk, but since I have had the wish, I have had no time to learn as you have now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="duke.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="duke.c1.s74"><qs/>"But Knights and Nobles never learn,"<qe/> said Richard.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="duke.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="duke.c1.s75"><qs/>"And do you think it a reason they never should?</s> <s sid="76" id="duke.c1.s76">But you are wrong, my boy, for the Kings of France and England, the Counts of Anjou, of Provence, and Paris, yes, even King Hako of Norway, {4} can all read."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="duke.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="duke.c1.s77"><qs/>"I tell you, Richard, when the treaty was drawn up for restoring this King Louis to his throne, I was ashamed to find myself one of the few crown vassals who could not write his name thereto."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="duke.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="duke.c1.s78"><qs/>"But none is so wise or so good as you, father,"<qe/> said Richard, proudly.</s> <s sid="79" id="duke.c1.s79"><qs/>"Sir Eric often says so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="duke.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="duke.c1.s80"><qs/>"Sir Eric loves his Duke too well to see his faults,"<qe/><sss/> said Duke William; <sse/><qs/>"but far better and wiser might I have been, had I been taught by such masters as you may be.</s> <s sid="81" id="duke.c1.s81">And hark, Richard, not only can all Princes here read, but in England, King Ethelstane would have every Noble taught; they study in his own palace, with his brothers, and read the good words that King Alfred the truth-teller put into their own tongue for them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="duke.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="duke.c1.s82"><qs/>"I hate the English,"<qe/> said Richard, raising his head and looking very fierce.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="duke.c1.p43"><s sid="89" id="duke.c1.s89">Duke William looked grave.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="duke.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="duke.c1.s90"><qs/>"Fru Astrida must sing you no more such Sagas,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"if they fill your mind with these revengeful thoughts, fit only for the worshippers of Odin and Thor.</s> <s sid="91" id="duke.c1.s91">Neither Ragnar nor his sons knew better than to rejoice in this deadly vengeance, but we, who are Christians, know that it is for us to forgive."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="duke.c1.p45" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="duke.c1.s92"><qs/>"The English had slain their father!"<qe/> said Richard, looking up with wondering dissatisfied eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="duke.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="duke.c2.s3">The men of the household sat ranged on benches on one side of the hall, the women on the other; a great red fire, together with an immense flickering lamp which hung from the ceiling, supplied the light; the windows were closed with wooden shutters, and the whole apartment had a cheerful appearance.</s> <s sid="4" id="duke.c2.s4">Two or three large hounds were reposing in front of the hearth, and among them sat little Richard of Normandy, now smoothing down their broad silken ears; now tickling the large cushions of their feet with the end of one of Osmond's feathers; now fairly pulling open the eyes of one of the good-natured sleepy creatures, which only stretched its legs, and remonstrated with a sort of low groan, rather than a growl.</s> <s sid="5" id="duke.c2.s5">The boy's eyes were, all the time, intently fixed on Dame Astrida, as if he would not lose one word of the story she was telling him; how Earl Rollo, his grandfather, had sailed into the mouth of the Seine, and how Archbishop Franco, of Rouen, had come to meet him and brought him the keys of the town, and how not one Neustrian of Rouen had met with harm from the brave Northmen.</s> <s sid="6" id="duke.c2.s6">Then she told him of his grandfather's baptism, and how during the seven days that he wore his white baptismal robes, he had made large gifts to all the chief churches in his dukedom of Normandy.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="duke.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="duke.c2.s7"><qs/>"Oh, but tell of the paying homage!"<qe/><sss/> said Richard; <sse/><qs/>"and how Sigurd Bloodaxe threw down simple King Charles!</s> <s sid="8" id="duke.c2.s8">Ah! how would I have laughed to see it!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="duke.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="duke.c2.s9"><qs/>"Nay, nay, Lord Richard,"<qe/><sss/> said the old lady, <sse/><qs/>"I love not that tale.</s> <s sid="10" id="duke.c2.s10">That was ere the Norman learnt courtesy, and rudeness ought rather to be forgotten than remembered, save for the sake of amending it.</s> <s sid="11" id="duke.c2.s11">No, I will rather tell you of our coming to Centeville, and how dreary I thought these smooth meads, and broad soft gliding streams, compared with mine own father's fiord in Norway, shut in with the tall black rocks, and dark pines above them, and far away the snowy mountains rising into the sky.</s> <s sid="12" id="duke.c2.s12">Ah! how blue the waters were in the long summer days when I sat in my father's boat in the little fiord, and--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="duke.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="duke.c2.s13">Dame Astrida was interrupted.</s> <s sid="14" id="duke.c2.s14">A bugle note rang out at the castle gate; the dogs started to their feet, and uttered a sudden deafening bark; Osmond sprung up, exclaiming, <qs/>"Hark!"<qe/><sls/> and trying to silence the hounds; and Richard running to Sir Eric, cried, <sle/><qs/>"Wake, wake, Sir Eric, my father is come!</s> <s sid="15" id="duke.c2.s15">Oh, haste to open the gate, and admit him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="duke.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="duke.c2.s16"><qs/>"Peace, dogs!"<qe/> said Sir Eric, slowly rising, as the blast of the horn was repeated.</s> <s sid="17" id="duke.c2.s17"><qs/>"Go, Osmond, with the porter, and see whether he who comes at such an hour be friend or foe.</s> <s sid="18" id="duke.c2.s18">Stay you here, my Lord,"<qe/> he added, as Richard was running after Osmond; and the little boy obeyed, and stood still, though quivering all over with impatience.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="duke.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="duke.c2.s19"><qs/>"Tidings from the Duke, I should guess,"<qe/> said Fru Astrida.</s> <s sid="20" id="duke.c2.s20"><qs/>"It can scarce be himself at such an hour."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="duke.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="duke.c2.s21"><qs/>"Oh, it must be, dear Fru Astrida!"<qe/> said Richard.</s> <s sid="22" id="duke.c2.s22"><qs/>"He said he would come again.</s> <s sid="23" id="duke.c2.s23">Hark, there are horses' feet in the court!</s> <s sid="24" id="duke.c2.s24">I am sure that is his black charger's tread!</s> <s sid="25" id="duke.c2.s25">And I shall not be there to hold his stirrup!</s> <s sid="26" id="duke.c2.s26">Oh!</s> <s sid="27" id="duke.c2.s27">Sir Eric, let me go."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="duke.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="duke.c2.s28">Sir Eric, always a man of few words, only shook his head, and at that moment steps were heard on the stone stairs.</s> <s sid="29" id="duke.c2.s29">Again Richard was about to spring forward, when Osmond returned, his face showing, at a glance, that something was amiss; but all that he said was, <qs/>"Count Bernard of Harcourt, and Sir Rainulf de Ferrieres,"<qe/> and he stood aside to let them pass.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="duke.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="duke.c2.s30">Richard stood still in the midst of the hall, disappointed.</s> <s sid="31" id="duke.c2.s31">Without greeting to Sir Eric, or to any within the hall, the Count of Harcourt came forward to Richard, bent his knee before him, took his hand, and said with a broken voice and heaving breast, <qs/>"Richard, Duke of Normandy, I am thy liegeman and true vassal;"<qe/> then rising from his knees while Rainulf de Ferrieres went through the same form, the old man covered his face with his hands and wept aloud.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="duke.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="duke.c2.s32"><qs/>"Is it even so?"<qe/><sls/> said the Baron de Centeville; and being answered by a mournful look and sigh from Ferrieres, he too bent before the boy, and repeated the words, <sle/><qs/>"I am thy liegeman and true vassal, and swear fealty to thee for my castle and barony of Centeville."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="duke.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="duke.c2.s33"><qs/>"Oh, no, no!"<qe/> cried Richard, drawing back his hand in a sort of agony, feeling as if he was in a frightful dream from which he could not awake.</s> <s sid="34" id="duke.c2.s34"><qs/>"What means it?</s> <s sid="35" id="duke.c2.s35">Oh!</s> <s sid="36" id="duke.c2.s36">Fru Astrida, tell me what means it?</s> <s sid="37" id="duke.c2.s37">Where is my father?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="duke.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="duke.c2.s39"><qs/>"Alas, my child!"<qe/> said the old lady, putting her arm round him, and drawing him close to her, whilst her tears flowed fast, and Richard stood, reassured by her embrace, listening with eyes open wide, and deep oppressed breathing, to what was passing between the four nobles, who spoke earnestly among themselves, without much heed of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="duke.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="duke.c2.s40"><qs/>"The Duke dead!"<qe/> repeated Sir Eric de Centeville, like one stunned and stupefied.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="duke.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="duke.c2.s41"><qs/>"Even so,"<qe/> said Rainulf, slowly and sadly, and the silence was only broken by the long-drawn sobs of old Count Bernard.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="duke.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="duke.c2.s42"><qs/>"But how? when? where?"<qe/> broke forth Sir Eric, presently.</s> <s sid="43" id="duke.c2.s43"><qs/>"There was no note of battle when you went forth.</s> <s sid="44" id="duke.c2.s44">Oh, why was not I at his side?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="duke.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="duke.c2.s45"><qs/>"He fell not in battle,"<qe/> gloomily replied Sir Rainulf.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="duke.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="duke.c2.s46"><qs/>"Ha! could sickness cut him down so quickly?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="duke.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="duke.c2.s47"><qs/>"It was not sickness,"<qe/> answered Ferrieres.</s> <s sid="48" id="duke.c2.s48"><qs/>"It was treachery.</s> <s sid="49" id="duke.c2.s49">He fell in the Isle of Pecquigny, by the hand of the false Fleming!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="duke.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="duke.c2.s50"><qs/>"Lives the traitor yet?"<qe/> cried the Baron de Centeville, grasping his good sword.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="duke.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="duke.c2.s51"><qs/>"He lives and rejoices in his crime,"<qe/><sss/> said Ferrieres, <sse/><qs/>"safe in his own merchant towns."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="duke.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="duke.c2.s52"><qs/>"I can scarce credit you, my Lords!"<qe/> said Sir Eric.</s> <s sid="53" id="duke.c2.s53"><qs/>"Our Duke slain, and his enemy safe, and you here to tell the tale!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="duke.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="duke.c2.s54"><qs/>"I would I were stark and stiff by my Lord's side!"<qe/><sss/> said Count Bernard, <sse/><qs/>"but for the sake of Normandy, and of that poor child, who is like to need all that ever were friends to his house.</s> <s sid="55" id="duke.c2.s55">I would that mine eyes had been blinded for ever, ere they had seen that sight!</s> <s sid="56" id="duke.c2.s56">And not a sword lifted in his defence!</s> <s sid="57" id="duke.c2.s57">Tell you how it passed, Rainulf!</s> <s sid="58" id="duke.c2.s58">My tongue will not speak it!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="duke.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="duke.c2.s59">He threw himself on a bench and covered his face with his mantle, while Rainulf de Ferrieres proceeded:</s> <s sid="60" id="duke.c2.s60"><qs/>"You know how in an evil hour our good Duke appointed to meet this caitiff, Count of Flanders, in the Isle of Pecquigny, the Duke and Count each bringing twelve men with them, all unarmed.</s> <s sid="61" id="duke.c2.s61">Duke Alan of Brittany was one on our side, Count Bernard here another, old Count Bothon and myself; we bore no weapon--would that we had--but not so the false Flemings.</s> <s sid="62" id="duke.c2.s62">Ah me!</s> <s sid="63" id="duke.c2.s63">I shall never forget Duke William's lordly presence when he stepped ashore, and doffed his bonnet to the knave Arnulf."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="duke.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="duke.c2.s64"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/> interposed Bernard.</s> <s sid="65" id="duke.c2.s65"><qs/>"And marked you not the words of the traitor, as they met?</s> <s sid="66" id="duke.c2.s66"><alt-qs/>'My Lord,'<alt-qe/><alt-sss/><sss/> quoth he, <sse/><alt-sse/><alt-qs/>'you are my shield and defence.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="duke.c2.s67">{6} Would that I could cleave his treason-hatching skull with my battle-axe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="duke.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="duke.c2.s68"><qs/>"So,"<qe/><sss/> continued Rainulf, <sse/><qs/>"they conferred together, and as words cost nothing to Arnulf, he not only promised all restitution to the paltry Montreuil, but even was for offering to pay homage to our Duke for Flanders itself; but this our William refused, saying it were foul wrong to both King Louis of France, and Kaiser Otho of Germany, to take from them their vassal.</s> <s sid="69" id="duke.c2.s69">They took leave of each other in all courtesy, and we embarked again.</s> <s sid="70" id="duke.c2.s70">It was Duke William's pleasure to go alone in a small boat, while we twelve were together in another.</s> <s sid="71" id="duke.c2.s71">Just as we had nearly reached our own bank, there was a shout from the Flemings that their Count had somewhat further to say to the Duke, and forbidding us to follow him, the Duke turned his boat and went back again.</s> <s sid="72" id="duke.c2.s72">No sooner had he set foot on the isle,"<qe/><sls/> proceeded the Norman, clenching his hands, and speaking between his teeth, <sle/><qs/>"than we saw one Fleming strike him on the head with an oar; he fell senseless, the rest threw themselves upon him, and the next moment held up their bloody daggers in scorn at us!</s> <s sid="73" id="duke.c2.s73">You may well think how we shouted and yelled at them, and plied our oars like men distracted, but all in vain, they were already in their boats, and ere we could even reach the isle, they were on the other side of the river, mounted their horses, fled with coward speed, and were out of reach of a Norman's vengeance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="duke.c2.p28" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="duke.c2.s74"><qs/>"But they shall not be so long!"<qe/> cried Richard, starting forward; for to his childish fancy this dreadful history was more like one of Dame Astrida's legends than a reality, and at the moment his thought was only of the blackness of the treason.</s> <s sid="75" id="duke.c2.s75"><qs/>"Oh, that I were a man to chastise them!</s> <s sid="76" id="duke.c2.s76">One day they shall feel--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="duke.c2.p29"><s sid="77" id="duke.c2.s77">He broke off short, for he remembered how his father had forbidden his denunciations of vengeance, but his words were eagerly caught up by the Barons, who, as Duke William had said, were far from possessing any temper of forgiveness, thought revenge a duty, and were only glad to see a warlike spirit in their new Prince.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="duke.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="duke.c2.s78"><qs/>"Ha! say you so, my young Lord?"<qe/> exclaimed old Count Bernard, rising.</s> <s sid="79" id="duke.c2.s79"><qs/>"Yes, and I see a sparkle in your eye that tells me you will one day avenge him nobly!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="duke.c2.p31" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="duke.c2.s80">Richard drew up his head, and his heart throbbed high as Sir Eric made answer, <qs/>"Ay, truly, that will he!</s> <s sid="81" id="duke.c2.s81">You might search Normandy through, yea, and Norway likewise, ere you would find a temper more bold and free.</s> <s sid="82" id="duke.c2.s82">Trust my word, Count Bernard, our young Duke will be famed as widely as ever were his forefathers!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="duke.c2.p32" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="duke.c2.s83"><qs/>"I believe it well!"<qe/> said Bernard.</s> <s sid="84" id="duke.c2.s84"><qs/>"He hath the port of his grandfather, Duke Rollo, and much, too, of his noble father!</s> <s sid="85" id="duke.c2.s85">How say you, Lord Richard, will you be a valiant leader of the Norman race against our foes?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="duke.c2.p33" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="duke.c2.s86"><qs/>"That I will!"<qe/> said Richard, carried away by the applause excited by those few words of his.</s> <s sid="87" id="duke.c2.s87"><qs/>"I will ride at your head this very night if you will but go to chastise the false Flemings."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="duke.c2.p34" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="duke.c2.s88"><qs/>"You shall ride with us to-morrow, my Lord,"<qe/><sss/> answered Bernard, <sse/><qs/>"but it must be to Rouen, there to be invested with your ducal sword and mantle, and to receive the homage of your vassals."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="duke.c2.p35"><s sid="89" id="duke.c2.s89">Richard drooped his head without replying, for this seemed to bring to him the perception that his father was really gone, and that he should never see him again.</s> <s sid="90" id="duke.c2.s90">He thought of all his projects for the day of his return, how he had almost counted the hours, and had looked forward to telling him that Father Lucas was well pleased with him!</s> <s sid="91" id="duke.c2.s91">And now he should never nestle into his breast again, never hear his voice, never see those kind eyes beam upon him.</s> <s sid="92" id="duke.c2.s92">Large tears gathered in his eyes, and ashamed that they should be seen, he sat down on a footstool at Fru Astrida's feet, leant his forehead on his hands, and thought over all that his father had done and said the last time they were together.</s> <s sid="93" id="duke.c2.s93">He fancied the return that had been promised, going over the meeting and the greeting, till he had almost persuaded himself that this dreadful story was but a dream.</s> <s sid="94" id="duke.c2.s94">But when he looked up, there were the Barons, with their grave mournful faces, speaking of the corpse, which Duke Alan of Brittany was escorting to Rouen, there to be buried beside the old Duke Rollo, and the Duchess Emma, Richard's mother.</s> <s sid="95" id="duke.c2.s95">Then he lost himself in wonder how that stiff bleeding body could be the same as the father whose arm was so lately around him, and whether his father's spirit knew how he was thinking of him; and in these dreamy thoughts, the young orphan Duke of Normandy, forgotten by his vassals in their grave councils, fell asleep, and scarce wakened enough to attend to his prayers, when Fru Astrida at length remembered him, and led him away to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="duke.c2.p36" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="duke.c2.s96">When Richard awoke the next morning, he could hardly believe that all that had passed in the evening was true, but soon he found that it was but too real, and all was prepared for him to go to Rouen with the vassals; indeed, it was for no other purpose than to fetch him that the Count of Harcourt had come to Bayeux.</s> <s sid="97" id="duke.c2.s97">Fru Astrida was quite unhappy that <qs/>"the child,"<qe/> as she called him, should go alone with the warriors; but Sir Eric laughed at her, and said that it would never do for the Duke of Normandy to bring his nurse with him in his first entry into Rouen, and she must be content to follow at some space behind under the escort of Walter the huntsman.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="duke.c2.p37"><s sid="98" id="duke.c2.s98">So she took leave of Richard, charging both Sir Eric and Osmond to have the utmost care of him, and shedding tears as if the parting was to be for a much longer space; then he bade farewell to the servants of the castle, received the blessing of Father Lucas, and mounting his pony, rode off between Sir Eric and Count Bernard.</s> <s sid="99" id="duke.c2.s99">Richard was but a little boy, and he did not think so much of his loss, as he rode along in the free morning air, feeling himself a Prince at the head of his vassals, his banner displayed before him, and the people coming out wherever he passed to gaze on him, and call for blessings on his name.</s> <s sid="100" id="duke.c2.s100">Rainulf de Ferrieres carried a large heavy purse filled with silver and gold, and whenever they came to these gazing crowds, Richard was well pleased to thrust his hands deep into it, and scatter handfuls of coins among the gazers, especially where he saw little children.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="duke.c2.p38"><s sid="101" id="duke.c2.s101">They stopped to dine and rest in the middle of the day, at the castle of a Baron, who, as soon as the meal was over, mounted his horse, and joined them in their ride to Rouen.</s> <s sid="102" id="duke.c2.s102">So far it had not been very different from Richard's last journey, when he went to keep Christmas there with his father; but now they were beginning to come nearer the town, he knew the broad river Seine again, and saw the square tower of the Cathedral, and he remembered how at that very place his father had met him, and how he had ridden by his side into the town, and had been led by his hand up to the hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="duke.c2.p39"><s sid="103" id="duke.c2.s103">His heart was very heavy, as he recollected there was no one now to meet and welcome him; scarcely any one to whom he could even tell his thoughts, for those tall grave Barons had nothing to say to such a little boy, and the very respect and formality with which they treated him, made him shrink from them still more, especially from the grim-faced Bernard; and Osmond, his own friend and playfellow, was obliged to ride far behind, as inferior in rank.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="duke.c2.p40" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="duke.c2.s104">They entered the town just as it was growing dark.</s> <s sid="105" id="duke.c2.s105">Count Bernard looked back and arrayed the procession; Eric de Centeville bade Richard sit upright and not look weary, and then all the Knights held back while the little Duke rode alone a little in advance of them through the gateway.</s> <s sid="106" id="duke.c2.s106">There was a loud shout of <qs/>"Long live the little Duke!"<qe/> and crowds of people were standing round to gaze upon his entry, so many that the bag of coins was soon emptied by his largesses.</s> <s sid="107" id="duke.c2.s107">The whole city was like one great castle, shut in by a wall and moat, and with Rollo's Tower rising at one end like the keep of a castle, and it was thither that Richard was turning his horse, when the Count of Harcourt said, <qs/>"Nay, my Lord, to the Church of our Lady."<qe/></s> <s sid="108" id="duke.c2.s108">{7}</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="duke.c2.p41"><s sid="109" id="duke.c2.s109">It was then considered a duty to be paid to the deceased, that their relatives and friends should visit them as they lay in state, and sprinkle them with drops of holy water, and Richard was now to pay this token of respect.</s> <s sid="110" id="duke.c2.s110">He trembled a little, and yet it did not seem quite so dreary, since he should once more look on his father's face, and he accordingly rode towards the Cathedral.</s> <s sid="111" id="duke.c2.s111">It was then very unlike what it is now; the walls were very thick, the windows small and almost buried in heavy carved arches, the columns within were low, clumsy, and circular, and it was usually so dark that the vaulting of the roof could scarcely be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="duke.c2.p42"><s sid="112" id="duke.c2.s112">Now, however, a whole flood of light poured forth from every window, and when Richard came to the door, he saw not only the two tall thick candles that always burnt on each side of the Altar, but in the Chancel stood a double row ranged in a square, shedding a pure, quiet brilliancy throughout the building, and chiefly on the silver and gold ornaments of the Altar.</s> <s sid="113" id="duke.c2.s113">Outside these lights knelt a row of priests in dark garments, their heads bowed over their clasped hands, and their chanted psalms sounding sweet, and full of soothing music.</s> <s sid="114" id="duke.c2.s114">Within that guarded space was a bier, and a form lay on it.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="duke.c2.p43"><s sid="115" id="duke.c2.s115">Richard trembled still more with awe, and would have paused, but he was obliged to proceed.</s> <s sid="116" id="duke.c2.s116">He dipped his hand in the water of the font, crossed his brow, and came slowly on, sprinkled the remaining drops on the lifeless figure, and then stood still.</s> <s sid="117" id="duke.c2.s117">There was an oppression on his breast as if he could neither breathe nor move.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="duke.c4.p41"><s sid="79" id="duke.c4.s79">However, Alberic was quite as courteous and respectful to the Duke when they were not at play, as the difference of their rank required; indeed, he had learnt much more of grace and courtliness of demeanour from his mother, a Provencal lady, than was yet to be found among the Normans.</s> <s sid="80" id="duke.c4.s80">The Chaplain of Montemar had begun to teach him to read and write, and he liked learning much better than Richard, who would not have gone on with Father Lucas's lessons at all, if Abbot Martin of Jumieges had not put him in mind that it had been his father's especial desire.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="duke.c4.p42" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="duke.c4.s81">What Richard most disliked was, however, the being obliged to sit in council.</s> <s sid="82" id="duke.c4.s82">The Count of Harcourt did in truth govern the dukedom, but nothing could be done without the Duke's consent, and once a week at least, there was held in the great hall of Rollo's tower, what was called a _Parlement_, or <qs/>"a talkation,"<qe/> where Count Bernard, the Archbishop, the Baron de Centeville, the Abbot of Jumieges, and such other Bishops, Nobles, or Abbots, as might chance to be at Rouen, consulted on the affairs of Normandy; and there the little Duke always was forced to be present, sitting up in his chair of state, and hearing rather than listening to, questions about the repairing and guarding of Castles, the asking of loans from the vassals, the appeals from the Barons of the Exchequer, who were then Nobles sent through the duchy to administer justice, and the discussions about the proceedings of his neighbours, King Louis of France, Count Foulques of Anjou, and Count Herluin of Montreuil, and how far the friendship of Hugh of Paris, and Alan of Brittany might be trusted.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="duke.c4.p43"><s sid="83" id="duke.c4.s83">Very tired of all this did Richard grow, especially when he found that the Normans had made up their minds not to attempt a war against the wicked Count of Flanders.</s> <s sid="84" id="duke.c4.s84">He sighed most wearily, yawned again and again, and moved restlessly about in his chair; but whenever Count Bernard saw him doing so, he received so severe a look and sign that he grew perfectly to dread the eye of the fierce old Dane.</s> <s sid="85" id="duke.c4.s85">Bernard never spoke to him to praise him, or to enter into any of his pursuits; he only treated him with the grave distant respect due to him as a Prince, or else now and then spoke a few stern words to him of reproof for this restlessness, or for some other childish folly.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="duke.c4.p44"><s sid="86" id="duke.c4.s86">Used as Richard was to be petted and made much of by the whole house of Centeville, he resented this considerably in secret, disliked and feared the old Count, and more than once told Alberic de Montemar, that as soon as he was fourteen, when he would be declared of age, he should send Count Bernard to take care of his own Castle of Harcourt, instead of letting him sit gloomy and grim in the Castle hall in the evening, spoiling all their sport.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="duke.c4.p45"><s sid="87" id="duke.c4.s87">Winter had set in, and Osmond used daily to take the little Duke and Alberic to the nearest sheet of ice, for the Normans still prided themselves on excelling in skating, though they had long since left the frost-bound streams and lakes of Norway.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="duke.c6.p4"><s sid="7" id="duke.c6.s7">The country beyond was not like Normandy.</s> <s sid="8" id="duke.c6.s8">First they came to a great forest, which seemed to have no path through it.</s> <s sid="9" id="duke.c6.s9">The King ordered that one of the men, who had rowed them across, should be made to serve as guide, and two of the men-at-arms took him between them, and forced him to lead the way, while others, with their swords and battle-axes, cut down and cleared away the tangled branches and briars that nearly choked the path.</s> <s sid="10" id="duke.c6.s10">All the time, every one was sharply on the look-out for robbers, and the weapons were all held ready for use at a moment's notice.</s> <s sid="11" id="duke.c6.s11">On getting beyond the forest a Castle rose before them, and, though it was not yet late in the day, they resolved to rest there, as a marsh lay not far before them, which it would not have been safe to traverse in the evening twilight.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="duke.c6.p5"><s sid="12" id="duke.c6.s12">The Baron of the Castle received them with great respect to the King, but without paying much attention to the Duke of Normandy, and Richard did not find the second place left for him at the board.</s> <s sid="13" id="duke.c6.s13">He coloured violently, and looked first at the King, and then at Osmond, but Osmond held up his finger in warning; he remembered how he had lost his temper before, and what had come of it, and resolved to try to bear it better; and just then the Baron's daughter, a gentle-looking maiden of fifteen or sixteen, came and spoke to him, and entertained him so well, that he did not think much more of his offended dignity.--When they set off on their journey again, the Baron and several of his followers came with them to show the only safe way across the morass, and a very slippery, treacherous, quaking road it was, where the horses' feet left pools of water wherever they trod.</s> <s sid="14" id="duke.c6.s14">The King and the Baron rode together, and the other French Nobles closed round them; Richard was left quite in the background, and though the French men-at-arms took care not to lose sight of him, no one offered him any assistance, excepting Osmond, who, giving his own horse to Sybald, one of the two Norman grooms who accompanied him, led Richard's horse by the bridle along the whole distance of the marshy path, a business that could scarcely have been pleasant, as Osmond wore his heavy hauberk, and his pointed, iron-guarded boots sunk deep at every step into the bog.</s> <s sid="15" id="duke.c6.s15">He spoke little, but seemed to be taking good heed of every stump of willow or stepping-stone that might serve as a note of remembrance of the path.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="duke.c6.p6"><s sid="16" id="duke.c6.s16">At the other end of the morass began a long tract of dreary-looking, heathy waste, without a sign of life.</s> <s sid="17" id="duke.c6.s17">The Baron took leave of the King, only sending three men-at-arms, to show him the way to a monastery, which was to be the next halting-place.</s> <s sid="18" id="duke.c6.s18">He sent three, because it was not safe for one, even fully armed, to ride alone, for fear of the attacks of the followers of a certain marauding Baron, who was at deadly feud with him, and made all that border a most perilous region.</s> <s sid="19" id="duke.c6.s19">Richard might well observe that he did not like the Vexin half as well as Normandy, and that the people ought to learn Fru Astrida's story of the golden bracelets, which, in his grandfather's time, had hung untouched for a year, in a tree in a forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="duke.c6.p7"><s sid="20" id="duke.c6.s20">It was pretty much the same through the whole journey, waste lands, marshes, and forests alternated.</s> <s sid="21" id="duke.c6.s21">The Castles stood on high mounds frowning on the country round, and villages were clustered round them, where the people either fled away, driving off their cattle with them at the first sight of an armed band, or else, if they remained, proved to be thin, wretched-looking creatures, with wasted limbs, aguish faces, and often iron collars round their necks.</s> <s sid="22" id="duke.c6.s22">Wherever there was anything of more prosperous appearance, such as a few cornfields, vineyards on the slopes of the hills, fat cattle, and peasantry looking healthy and secure, there was sure to be seen a range of long low stone buildings, surmounted with crosses, with a short square Church tower rising in the midst, and interspersed with gnarled hoary old apple-trees, or with gardens of pot-herbs spreading before them to the meadows.</s> <s sid="23" id="duke.c6.s23">If, instead of two or three men-at-arms from a Castle, or of some trembling serf pressed into the service, and beaten, threatened, and watched to prevent treachery, the King asked for a guide at a Convent, some lay brother would take his staff; or else mount an ass, and proceed in perfect confidence and security as to his return homewards, sure that his poverty and his sacred character would alike protect him from any outrage from the most lawless marauder of the neighbourhood.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="duke.c6.p8"><s sid="24" id="duke.c6.s24">Thus they travelled until they reached the royal Castle of Laon, where the Fleur-de-Lys standard on the battlements announced the presence of Gerberge, Queen of France, and her two sons.</s> <s sid="25" id="duke.c6.s25">The King rode first into the court with his Nobles, and before Richard could follow him through the narrow arched gateway, he had dismounted, entered the Castle, and was out of sight.</s> <s sid="26" id="duke.c6.s26">Osmond held the Duke's stirrup, and followed him up the steps which led to the Castle Hall.</s> <s sid="27" id="duke.c6.s27">It was full of people, but no one made way, and Richard, holding his Squire's hand, looked up in his face, inquiring and bewildered.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="duke.c6.p10" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="duke.c6.s29">Richard had no longer any cause to complain of neglect, for the Seneschal instantly made him a very low bow, and calling <qs/>"Place--place for the high and mighty Prince, my Lord Duke of Normandy!"<qe/> ushered him up to the dais or raised part of the floor, where the King and Queen stood together talking.</s> <s sid="30" id="duke.c6.s30">The Queen looked round, as Richard was announced, and he saw her face, which was sallow, and with a sharp sour expression that did not please him, and he backed and looked reluctant, while Osmond, with a warning hand pressed on his shoulder, was trying to remind him that he ought to go forward, kneel on one knee, and kiss her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="duke.c6.p15"><s sid="36" id="duke.c6.s36">Luckily he spoke his own language; but his look and air expressed a good deal of what he said, and Gerberge looked all the more unattractive.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="duke.c6.p17"><s sid="39" id="duke.c6.s39">Richard bowed, partly because Osmond forced down his shoulder; but he thought of old Rollo and Charles the Simple, and his proud heart resolved that he would never kiss the hand of that sour-looking Queen.</s> <s sid="40" id="duke.c6.s40">It was a determination made in pride and defiance, and he suffered for it afterwards; but no more passed now, for the Queen only saw in his behaviour that of an unmannerly young Northman: and though she disliked and despised him, she did not care enough about his courtesy to insist on its being paid.</s> <s sid="41" id="duke.c6.s41">She sat down, and so did the King, and they went on talking; the King probably telling her his adventures at Rouen, while Richard stood on the step of the dais, swelling with sullen pride.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="duke.c7.p31"><s sid="78" id="duke.c7.s78">The cheek continued inflamed and painful for some time, and there was a deep scar long after the pain had ceased, but Richard thought little of it after the first, and would have scorned to bear ill-will to Lothaire for the injury.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="duke.c7.p32"><s sid="79" id="duke.c7.s79">Lothaire left off taunting Richard with his Norman accent, and calling him a young Sea-king.</s> <s sid="80" id="duke.c7.s80">He had felt his strength, and was afraid of him; but he did not like him the better--he never played with him willingly--scowled, and looked dark and jealous, if his father, or if any of the great nobles took the least notice of the little Duke, and whenever he was out of hearing, talked against him with all his natural spitefulness.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="duke.c7.p33"><s sid="81" id="duke.c7.s81">Richard liked Lothaire quite as little, contemning almost equally his cowardly ways and his imperious disposition.</s> <s sid="82" id="duke.c7.s82">Since he had been Duke, Richard had been somewhat inclined to grow imperious himself, though always kept under restraint by Fru Astrida's good training, and Count Bernard's authority, and his whole generous nature would have revolted against treating Alberic, or indeed his meanest vassal, as Lothaire used the unfortunate children who were his playfellows.</s> <s sid="83" id="duke.c7.s83">Perhaps this made him look on with great horror at the tyranny which Lothaire exercised; at any rate he learnt to abhor it more, and to make many resolutions against ordering people about uncivilly when once he should be in Normandy again.</s> <s sid="84" id="duke.c7.s84">He often interfered to protect the poor boys, and generally with success, for the Prince was afraid of provoking such another shake as Richard had once given him, and though he generally repaid himself on his victim in the end, he yielded for the time.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="duke.c7.p34"><s sid="85" id="duke.c7.s85">Carloman, whom Richard often saved from his brother's unkindness, clung closer and closer to him, went with him everywhere, tried to do all he did, grew very fond of Osmond, and liked nothing better than to sit by Richard in some wide window-seat, in the evening, after supper, and listen to Richard's version of some of Fru Astrida's favourite tales, or hear the never-ending history of sports at Centeville, or at Rollo's Tower, or settle what great things they would both do when they were grown up, and Richard was ruling Normandy--perhaps go to the Holy Land together, and slaughter an unheard-of host of giants and dragons on the way.</s> <s sid="86" id="duke.c7.s86">In the meantime, however, poor Carloman gave small promise of being able to perform great exploits, for he was very small for his age and often ailing; soon tired, and never able to bear much rough play.</s> <s sid="87" id="duke.c7.s87">Richard, who had never had any reason to learn to forbear, did not at first understand this, and made Carloman cry several times with his roughness and violence, but this always vexed him so much that he grew careful to avoid such things for the future, and gradually learnt to treat his poor little weakly friend with a gentleness and patience at which Osmond used to marvel, and which he would hardly have been taught in his prosperity at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="duke.c7.p35"><s sid="88" id="duke.c7.s88">Between Carloman and Osmond he was thus tolerably happy at Laon, but he missed his own dear friends, and the loving greetings of his vassals, and longed earnestly to be at Rouen, asking Osmond almost every night when they should go back, to which Osmond could only answer that he must pray that Heaven would be pleased to bring them home safely.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="duke.c7.p36"><s sid="89" id="duke.c7.s89">Osmond, in the meantime, kept a vigilant watch for anything that might seem to threaten danger to his Lord; but at present there was no token of any evil being intended; the only point in which Louis did not seem to be fulfilling his promises to the Normans was, that no preparations were made for attacking the Count of Flanders.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="duke.c7.p37"><s sid="90" id="duke.c7.s90">At Easter the court was visited by Hugh the White, the great Count of Paris, the most powerful man in France, and who was only prevented by his own loyalty and forbearance, from taking the crown from the feeble and degenerate race of Charlemagne.</s> <s sid="91" id="duke.c7.s91">He had been a firm friend of William Longsword, and Osmond remarked how, on his arrival, the King took care to bring Richard forward, talk of him affectionately, and caress him almost as much as he had done at Rouen.</s> <s sid="92" id="duke.c7.s92">The Count himself was really kind and affectionate to the little Duke; he kept him by his side, and seemed to like to stroke down his long flaxen hair, looking in his face with a grave mournful expression, as if seeking for a likeness to his father.</s> <s sid="93" id="duke.c7.s93">He soon asked about the scar which the burn had left, and the King was obliged to answer hastily, it was an accident, a disaster that had chanced in a boyish quarrel.</s> <s sid="94" id="duke.c7.s94">Louis, in fact, was uneasy, and appeared to be watching the Count of Paris the whole time of his visit, so as to prevent him from having any conversation in private with the other great vassals assembled at the court.</s> <s sid="95" id="duke.c7.s95">Hugh did not seem to perceive this, and acted as if he was entirely at his ease, but at the same time he watched his opportunity.</s> <s sid="96" id="duke.c7.s96">One evening, after supper, he came up to the window where Richard and Carloman were, as usual, deep in story telling; he sat down on the stone seat, and taking Richard on his knee, he asked if he had any greetings for the Count de Harcourt.</s> </p>
