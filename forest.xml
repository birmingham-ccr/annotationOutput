<title>CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="forest.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="forest.c1.s1">The circumstances which I am about to relate to my juvenile readers took place in the year 1647.</s> <s sid="2" id="forest.c1.s2">By referring to the history of England, of that date, they will find that King Charles the First, against whom the Commons of England had rebelled, after a civil war of nearly five years, had been defeated, and was confined as a prisoner at Hampton Court.</s> <s sid="3" id="forest.c1.s3">The Cavaliers, or the party who fought for King Charles, had all been dispersed and the Parliamentary army under the command of Cromwell were beginning to control the Commons.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="forest.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="forest.c1.s4">It was in the month of November in this year that King Charles, accompanied by Sir John Berkely, Ashburnham, and Legg, made his escape from Hampton Court, and rode as fast as the horses could carry them toward that part of Hampshire which led to the New Forest.</s> <s sid="5" id="forest.c1.s5">The king expected that his friends had provided a vessel in which he might escape to France, but in this he was disappointed.</s> <s sid="6" id="forest.c1.s6">There was no vessel ready, and after riding for some time along the shore, he resolved to go to Titchfield, a seat belonging to the Earl of Southampton.</s> <s sid="7" id="forest.c1.s7">After a long consultation with those who attended him, he yielded to their advice, which was, to trust to Colonel Hammond, who was governor of the Isle of Wight for the Parliament, but who was supposed to be friendly to the king.</s> <s sid="8" id="forest.c1.s8">Whatever might be the feelings of commiseration of Colonel Hammond toward a king so unfortunately situated, he was firm in his duties toward his employers, and the consequence was that King Charles found himself again a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="forest.c1.p3"><s sid="9" id="forest.c1.s9">But we must now leave the king and retrace history to the commencement of the civil war.</s> <s sid="10" id="forest.c1.s10">A short distance from the town of Lymington, which is not far from Titchfield, where the king took shelter, but on the other side of Southampton Water, and south of the New Forest, to which it adjoins, was a property called Arnwood, which belonged to a Cavalier of the name of Beverley.</s> <s sid="11" id="forest.c1.s11">It was at that time a property of considerable value, being very extensive, and the park ornamented with valuable timber; for it abutted on the New Forest, and might have been supposed to have been a continuation of it.</s> <s sid="12" id="forest.c1.s12">This Colonel Beverley, as we must call him, for he rose to that rank in the king's army, was a valued friend and companion of Prince Rupert, and commanded several troops of cavalry.</s> <s sid="13" id="forest.c1.s13">He was ever at his side in the brilliant charges made by this gallant prince, and at last fell in his arms at the battle of Naseby.</s> <s sid="14" id="forest.c1.s14">Colonel Beverley had married into the family of the Villiers, and the issue of his marriage was two sons and two daughters; but his zeal and sense of duty had induced him, at the commencement of the war, to leave his wife and family at Arnwood, and he was fated never to meet them again.</s> <s sid="15" id="forest.c1.s15">The news of his death had such an effect upon Mrs. Beverley, already worn with anxiety on her husband's account, that a few months afterward she followed him to an early tomb, leaving the four children under the charge of an elderly relative, till such time as the family of the Villiers could protect them; but, as will appear by our history, this was not at that period possible.</s> <s sid="16" id="forest.c1.s16">The life of a king and many other lives were in jeopardy, and the orphans remained at Arnwood, still under the care of their elderly relation, at the time that our history commences.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="forest.c1.p4"><s sid="17" id="forest.c1.s17">The New Forest, my readers are perhaps aware, was first inclosed by William the Conqueror as a royal forest for his own amusement--for in those days most crowned heads were passionately fond of the chase; and they may also recollect that his successor, William Rufus, met his death in this forest by the glancing of an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell.</s> <s sid="18" id="forest.c1.s18">Since that time to the present day it has continued a royal domain.</s> <s sid="19" id="forest.c1.s19">At the period of which we are writing, it had an establishment of verderers and keepers, paid by the crown, amounting to some forty or fifty men.</s> <s sid="20" id="forest.c1.s20">At the commencement of the civil war they remained at their posts, but soon found, in the disorganized state of the country, that their wages were no longer to be obtained; and then, when the king had decided upon raising an army, Beverley, who held a superior office in the Forest, enrolled all the young and athletic men who were employed in the Forest, and marched them away with him to join the king's army.</s> <s sid="21" id="forest.c1.s21">Some few remained, their age not rendering their services of value, and among them was an old and attached servant of Beverley, a man above sixty years of age, whose name was Jacob Armitage, and who had obtained the situation through Colonel Beverley's interest.</s> <s sid="22" id="forest.c1.s22">Those who remained in the Forest lived in cottages many miles asunder, and indemnified themselves for the non-payment of their salaries by killing the deer for sale and for their own subsistence.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="forest.c1.p5"><s sid="23" id="forest.c1.s23">The cottage of Jacob Armitage was situated on the skirts of the New Forest, about a mile and a half from the mansion of Arnwood; and when Colonel Beverley went to join the king's troops, feeling how little security there would be for his wife and children in those troubled times, he requested the old man, by his attachment to the family, not to lose sight of Arnwood, but to call there as often as possible to see if he could be of service to Mrs. Beverley.</s> <s sid="24" id="forest.c1.s24">The colonel would have persuaded Jacob to have altogether taken up his residence at the mansion, but to this the old man objected.</s> <s sid="25" id="forest.c1.s25">He had been all his life under the greenwood tree, and could not bear to leave the forest.</s> <s sid="26" id="forest.c1.s26">He promised the colonel that he would watch over his family, and ever be at hand when required; and he kept his word.</s> <s sid="27" id="forest.c1.s27">The death of Colonel Beverley was a heavy blow to the old forester, and he watched over Mrs. Beverley and the orphans with the greatest solicitude; but when Mrs. Beverley followed her husband to the tomb, he then redoubled his attentions, and was seldom more than a few hours at a time away from the mansion.</s> <s sid="28" id="forest.c1.s28">The two boys were his inseparable companions, and he instructed them, young as they were, in all the secrets of his own calling.</s> <s sid="29" id="forest.c1.s29">Such was the state of affairs at the time that King Charles made his escape from Hampton Court; and I now shall resume my narrative from where it was broken off.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="forest.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="forest.c1.s30">As soon as the escape of Charles I. was made known to Cromwell and the Parliament, troops of horse were dispatched in every direction to the southward, toward which the prints of the horses' hoofs proved that he had gone.</s> <s sid="31" id="forest.c1.s31">As they found that he had proceeded in the direction of the New Forest, the troops were subdivided and ordered to scour the forest, in parties of twelve to twenty, while others hastened down to Southampton, Lymington, and every other seaport or part of the coast from which the king might be likely to embark.</s> <s sid="32" id="forest.c1.s32">Old Jacob had been at Arnwood on the day before, but on this day he had made up his mind to procure some venison, that he might not go there again empty-handed; for Miss Judith Villiers was very partial to venison, and was not slow to remind Jacob, if the larder was for many days deficient in that meat.</s> <s sid="33" id="forest.c1.s33">Jacob had gone out accordingly; he had gained his leeward position of a fine buck, and was gradually nearing him by stealth--now behind a huge oak tree, and then crawling through the high fern, so as to get within shot unperceived, when on a sudden the animal, which had been quietly feeding, bounded away and disappeared in the thicket.</s> <s sid="34" id="forest.c1.s34">At the same time Jacob perceived a small body of horse galloping through the glen in which the buck had been feeding.</s> <s sid="35" id="forest.c1.s35">Jacob had never yet seen the Parliamentary troops, for they had not during the war been sent into that part of the country, but their iron skull-caps, their buff accouterments, and dark habiliments assured him that such these must be; so very different were they from the gayly-equipped Cavalier cavalry commanded by Prince Rupert.</s> <s sid="36" id="forest.c1.s36">At the time that they advanced, Jacob had been lying down in the fern near to some low black-thorn bushes; not wishing to be perceived by them, he drew back between the bushes, intending to remain concealed until they should gallop out of sight; for Jacob thought, <qs/>"I am a king's forester, and they may consider me as an enemy, and who knows how I may be treated by them?"<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="forest.c1.s37">But Jacob was disappointed in his expectations of the troops riding past him; on the contrary, as soon as they arrived at an oak tree within twenty yards of where he was concealed, the order was given to halt and dismount; the sabers of the horsemen clattered in their iron sheaths as the order was obeyed, and the old man expected to be immediately discovered; but one of the thorn bushes was directly between him and the troopers, and effectually concealed him.</s> <s sid="38" id="forest.c1.s38">At last Jacob ventured to raise his head and peep through the bush; and he perceived that the men were loosening the girths of their black horses, or wiping away the perspiration from their sides with handfuls of fern.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="forest.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="forest.c1.s39">A powerfully-formed man, who appeared to command the others, was standing with his hand upon the arched neck of his steed, which appeared as fresh and vigorous as ever, although covered with foam and perspiration.</s> <s sid="40" id="forest.c1.s40"><qs/>"Spare not to rub down, my men,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"for we have tried the mettle of our horses, and have now but one half-hour's breathing-time.</s> <s sid="41" id="forest.c1.s41">We must be on, for the work of the Lord must be done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="forest.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="forest.c1.s42"><qs/>"They say that this forest is many miles in length and breadth,"<qe/><sls/> observed another of the men, <sle/><qs/>"and we may ride many a mile to no purpose; but here is James Southwold, who once was living in it as a verderer; nay, I think that he said that he was born and bred in these woods.</s> <s sid="43" id="forest.c1.s43">Was it not so, James Southwold?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="forest.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="forest.c1.s44"><qs/>"It is even as you say,"<qe/><sls/> replied an active-looking young man; <sle/><qs/>"I was born and bred in this forest, and my father was a verderer before me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="forest.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="forest.c1.s45">Jacob Armitage, who listened to the conversation, immediately recognized the young man in question.</s> <s sid="46" id="forest.c1.s46">He was one of those who had joined the king's army with the other verderers and keepers.</s> <s sid="47" id="forest.c1.s47">It pained him much to perceive that one who had always been considered a frank, true-hearted young man, and who left the forest to fight in defense of his king, was now turned a traitor, and had joined the ranks of the enemy; and Jacob thought how much better it had been for James Southwold, if he had never quitted the New Forest, and had not been corrupted by evil company; <qs/>"he was a good lad,"<qe/><sss/> thought Jacob, <sse/><qs/>"and now he is a traitor and a hypocrite."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="forest.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="forest.c1.s48"><qs/>"If born and bred in this forest, James Southwold,"<qe/><sls/> said the leader of the troop, <sle/><qs/>"you must fain know all its mazes and paths.</s> <s sid="49" id="forest.c1.s49">Now, call to mind, are there no secret hiding-places in which people may remain concealed; no thickets which may cover both man and horse?</s> <s sid="50" id="forest.c1.s50">Peradventure thou mayest point out the very spot where this man Charles may be hidden?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="forest.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="forest.c1.s51"><qs/>"I do know one dell, within a mile of Arnwood,"<qe/><sss/> replied James Southwold, <sse/><qs/>"which might cover double our troop from the eyes of the most wary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="forest.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="forest.c1.s52"><qs/>"We will ride there, then,"<qe/> replied the leader.</s> <s sid="53" id="forest.c1.s53"><qs/>"Arnwood, sayest thou? is not that the property of the Malignant Cavalier Beverley, who was shot down at Naseby?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="forest.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="forest.c1.s54"><qs/>"Even so,"<qe/><sss/> replied Southwold; <sse/><qs/>"and many is the time--that is, in the olden time, before I was regenerated--many is the day of revelry that I have passed there; many the cup of good ale that I have quaffed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="forest.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="forest.c1.s55"><qs/>"And thou shalt quaff it again,"<qe/> replied the leader.</s> <s sid="56" id="forest.c1.s56"><qs/>"Good ale was not intended only for Malignants, but for those who serve diligently.</s> <s sid="57" id="forest.c1.s57">After we have examined the dell which thou speakest of, we will direct our horses' heads toward Arnwood."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="forest.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="forest.c1.s58"><qs/>"Who knows but what the man Charles may be concealed in the Malignant's house?"<qe/> observed another.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="forest.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="forest.c1.s59"><qs/>"In the day I should say no,"<qe/><sss/> replied the leader; <sse/><qs/>"but in the night the Cavaliers like to have a roof over their heads; and, therefore, at night, and not before, will we proceed thither."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="forest.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="forest.c1.s60"><qs/>"I have searched many of their abodes,"<qe/><sss/> observed another, <sse/><qs/>"but search is almost in vain.</s> <s sid="61" id="forest.c1.s61">What with their spring panels, and secret doors, their false ceilings, and double walls, one may ferret forever, and find nothing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="forest.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="forest.c1.s62"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> replied the leader, <sse/><qs/>"their abodes are full of these popish abominations; but there is one way which is sure; and if the man Charles be concealed in any house, I venture to say that I will find him.</s> <s sid="63" id="forest.c1.s63">Fire and smoke will bring him forth; and to every Malignant's house within twenty miles will I apply the torch; but it must be at night, for we are not sure of his being housed during the day.</s> <s sid="64" id="forest.c1.s64">James Southwold, thou knowest well the mansion of Arnwood?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="forest.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="forest.c1.s65"><qs/>"I know well my way to all the offices below--the buttery, the cellar, and the kitchen; but I can not say that I have ever been into the apartments of the upper house."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="forest.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="forest.c1.s66"><qs/>"That it needeth not; if thou canst direct us to the lower entrance it will be sufficient."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="forest.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="forest.c1.s67"><qs/>"That can I, Master Ingram,"<qe/><sss/> replied Southwold, <sse/><qs/>"and to where the best ale used to be found."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="forest.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="forest.c1.s68"><qs/>"Enough, Southwold, enough; our work must be done, and diligently.</s> <s sid="69" id="forest.c1.s69">Now, my men, tighten your girths; we will just ride to the dell: if it conceals not whom we seek, it shall conceal us till night, and then the country shall be lighted up with the flames of Arnwood, while we surround the house and prevent escape.</s> <s sid="70" id="forest.c1.s70">Levelers, to horse!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="forest.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="forest.c1.s71">The troopers sprung upon their saddles, and went off at a hard trot, Southwold leading the way.</s> <s sid="72" id="forest.c1.s72">Jacob remained among the fern until they were out of sight, and then rose up.</s> <s sid="73" id="forest.c1.s73">He looked for a short time in the direction in which the troopers had gone, stooped down again to take up his gun, and then said, <qs/>"There's providence in this; yes, and there's providence in my not having my dog with me, for he would not have remained quiet for so long a time.</s> <s sid="74" id="forest.c1.s74">Who would ever have thought that James Southwold would have turned a traitor! more than traitor, for he is now ready to bite the hand that has fed him, to burn the house that has ever welcomed him.</s> <s sid="75" id="forest.c1.s75">This is a bad world, and I thank Heaven that I have lived in the woods.</s> <s sid="76" id="forest.c1.s76">But there is no time to lose;"<qe/> and the old forester threw his gun over his shoulder, and hastened away in the direction of his own cottage.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="forest.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="forest.c1.s77"><qs/>"And so the king has escaped,"<qe/><sls/> thought Jacob, as he went along, <sle/><qs/>"and he may be in the forest!</s> <s sid="78" id="forest.c1.s78">Who knows but he may be at Arnwood, for he must hardly know where to go for shelter?</s> <s sid="79" id="forest.c1.s79">I must haste and see Miss Judith immediately.</s> <s sid="80" id="forest.c1.s80"><alt-qs/>'Levelers, to horse!'<alt-qe/> the fellow said.</s> <s sid="81" id="forest.c1.s81">What's a Leveler?"<qe/> thought Jacob.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="forest.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="forest.c1.s82">As perhaps my readers may ask the same question, they must know that a large proportion of the Parliamentary army had at this time assumed the name of Levelers, in consequence of having taken up the opinion that every man should be on an equality, and property should be equally divided.</s> <s sid="83" id="forest.c1.s83">The hatred of these people to any one above them in rank or property, especially toward those of the king's party, which mostly consisted of men of rank and property, was unbounded, and they were merciless and cruel to the highest degree, throwing off much of that fanatical bearing and language which had before distinguished the Puritans.</s> <s sid="84" id="forest.c1.s84">Cromwell had great difficulty in eventually putting them down, which he did at last accomplish by hanging and slaughtering many.</s> <s sid="85" id="forest.c1.s85">Of this Jacob knew nothing; all he knew was, that Arnwood was to be burned down that night, and that it would be necessary to remove the family.</s> <s sid="86" id="forest.c1.s86">As for obtaining assistance to oppose the troopers, that he knew to be impossible.</s> <s sid="87" id="forest.c1.s87">As he thought of what must take place, he thanked God for having allowed him to gain the knowledge of what was to happen, and hastened on his way.</s> <s sid="88" id="forest.c1.s88">He had been about eight miles from Arnwood when he had concealed himself in the fern.</s> <s sid="89" id="forest.c1.s89">Jacob first went to his cottage to deposit his gun, saddled his forest pony, and set off for Arnwood.</s> <s sid="90" id="forest.c1.s90">In less than two hours the old man was at the door of the mansion; it was then about three o'clock in the afternoon, and being in the month of November, there was not so much as two hours of daylight remaining.</s> <s sid="91" id="forest.c1.s91"><qs/>"I shall have a difficult job with the stiff old lady,"<qe/><sls/> thought Jacob, as be rung the bell; <sle/><qs/>"I don't believe that she would rise out of her high chair for old Noll and his whole army at his back.</s> <s sid="92" id="forest.c1.s92">But we shall see."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="forest.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="forest.c2.s1">Before Jacob is admitted to the presence of Miss Judith Villiers, we must give some account of the establishment at Arnwood.</s> <s sid="2" id="forest.c2.s2">With the exception of one male servant, who officiated in the house and stable as his services might be required, every man of the household of Colonel Beverley had followed the fortunes of their master, and as none had returned, they, in all probability had shared his fate.</s> <s sid="3" id="forest.c2.s3">Three female servants, with the man above mentioned, composed the whole household.</s> <s sid="4" id="forest.c2.s4">Indeed, there was every reason for not increasing the establishment, for the rents were either paid in part, or not paid at all.</s> <s sid="5" id="forest.c2.s5">It was generally supposed that the property, now that the Parliament had gained the day, would be sequestrated, although such was not yet the case; and the tenants were unwilling to pay, to those who were not authorized to receive, the rents which they might be again called upon to make good.</s> <s sid="6" id="forest.c2.s6">Miss Judith Villiers, therefore, found it difficult to maintain the present household; and although she did not tell Jacob Armitage that such was the case, the fact was, that very often the venison which he brought to the mansion was all the meat that was in the larder.</s> <s sid="7" id="forest.c2.s7">The three female servants held the offices of cook, attendant upon Miss Villiers, and housemaid; the children being under the care of no particular servant, and left much to themselves.</s> <s sid="8" id="forest.c2.s8">There had been a chaplain in the house, but he had quitted before the death of Mrs. Beverley, and the vacancy had not been filled up; indeed, it could not well be, for the one who left had not received his salary for many months, and Miss Judith Villiers, expecting every day to be summoned by her relations to bring the children and join them, sat in her high chair waiting for the arrival of this summons, which, from the distracted state of the times, had never come.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="forest.c2.p2"><s sid="9" id="forest.c2.s9">As we have before said, the orphans were four in number; the two eldest were boys, and the youngest were girls.</s> <s sid="10" id="forest.c2.s10">Edward, the eldest boy, was between thirteen and fourteen years old; Humphrey, the second, was twelve; Alice, eleven; and Edith, eight.</s> <s sid="11" id="forest.c2.s11">As it is the history of these young persons which we are about to narrate, we shall say little about them at present, except that for many months they had been under little or no restraint, and less attended to.</s> <s sid="12" id="forest.c2.s12">Their companions were Benjamin, the man who remained in the house, and old Jacob Armitage, who passed all the time he could spare with them.</s> <s sid="13" id="forest.c2.s13">Benjamin was rather weak in intellect, and was a source of amusement rather than otherwise.</s> <s sid="14" id="forest.c2.s14">As for the female servants, one was wholly occupied with her attendance on Miss Judith, who was very exacting, and had a high notion of her own consequence.</s> <s sid="15" id="forest.c2.s15">The other two had more than sufficient employment; as, when there is no money to pay with, every thing must be done at home.</s> <s sid="16" id="forest.c2.s16">That, under such circumstances, the boys became boisterous and the little girls became romps, is not to be wondered at: but their having become so was the cause of Miss Judith seldom admitting them into her room.</s> <s sid="17" id="forest.c2.s17">It is true that they were sent for once a day, to ascertain if they were in the house, or in existence, but soon dismissed and left to their own resources.</s> <s sid="18" id="forest.c2.s18">Such was the neglect to which these young orphans was exposed.</s> <s sid="19" id="forest.c2.s19">It must, however, be admitted, that this very neglect made them independent and bold, full of health from constant activity, and more fitted for the change which was so soon to take place.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="forest.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="forest.c15.s1">It was now very dark, as there was no moon, and the stars were often obscured by the clouds, which were heavy and borne along by the wind, which was very high.</s> <s sid="2" id="forest.c15.s2">The light again appeared, and this time Edward heard the clash of the flint against the steel, and he was quite certain that it was somebody striking a light.</s> <s sid="3" id="forest.c15.s3">He advanced very cautiously, and arrived at a large tree, behind which he remained to reconnoiter.</s> <s sid="4" id="forest.c15.s4">The people, whoever they might be, were not more than thirty yards from him; a light spread its rays for a moment or two, and he could make out a figure kneeling and holding his hat to protect it from the wind; then it burned brighter, and he saw that a lantern had been lighted, and then again, of a sudden, all was dark: so Edward immediately satisfied himself that a dark lantern had been lighted and then closed.</s> <s sid="5" id="forest.c15.s5">Who the parties might be, he of course had no idea; but he was resolved that he would ascertain, if he could, before he accosted them and asked his way.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="forest.c15.p3"><s sid="8" id="forest.c15.s8">Edward went on his hands and knees, and crawled through the fern until he gained another tree, and within ten yards of them, and from where he could hear what they might say.</s> <s sid="9" id="forest.c15.s9">He was thus cautious, as he had been told by Oswald that there were many disbanded soldiers who had taken up their quarters in the forest, and had committed several depredations upon the houses adjacent to it, always returning to the forest as a rendezvous.</s> <s sid="10" id="forest.c15.s10">Edward listened, and heard one say--</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="forest.c15.p24"><s sid="52" id="forest.c15.s52">The two men then rose up; and the one whose name appeared to be Will first examined if the candle in his dark lantern burned well; and then they both set off, followed by Edward, who had heard quite enough to satisfy him that they were bent upon a burglary, if not murder.</s> <s sid="53" id="forest.c15.s53">Edward followed them, so as to keep their forms indistinctly in sight, which was as much as he could do at twenty yards' distance; fortunately the wind was so high that they did not hear his footsteps, although he often trod upon a rotten stick, which snapped as it broke in twain.</s> <s sid="54" id="forest.c15.s54">As near as Edward could guess, he had tracked them about three miles, when they stopped, and he perceived that they were examining their pistols, which they took from their belts.</s> <s sid="55" id="forest.c15.s55">They then went on again, and entered a small plantation of oak-trees, of about forty years' growth--very thick and very dark, with close underwood below.</s> <s sid="56" id="forest.c15.s56">They followed each other through a narrow path, until they came to a cleared place in the middle of the plantation, in which there stood a low cottage, surrounded with covert on every side, with the exception of some thirty yards of land around it.</s> <s sid="57" id="forest.c15.s57">All was still, and as dark as pitch; Edward remained behind the trees, and when the two men again stopped, he was not six feet from them.</s> <s sid="58" id="forest.c15.s58">They consulted in a low tone but the wind was so high that he could not distinguish what they said.</s> <s sid="59" id="forest.c15.s59">At last they advanced to the cottage, and Edward, still keeping within the trees, shifted his position, so that he should be opposite the gable end of the cottage.</s> <s sid="60" id="forest.c15.s60">He observed one man to go up to the front door, while the other went round to the door behind, as had been agreed.</s> <s sid="61" id="forest.c15.s61">Edward threw open the pan of the lock of the gun, and reprimed it, that he might be sure, and then waited for what was to follow.</s> <s sid="62" id="forest.c15.s62">He heard the man Will at the front door, talking and asking for shelter in a plaintive but loud voice; and shortly afterward he perceived a light through the chinks of the shutters--for Edward was continually altering his position to see what was going on in the front and in the back.</s> <s sid="63" id="forest.c15.s63">At one time, he thought of leveling his gun and killing one of the men at once; but he could not make up his mind to do that, as a burglary, although intended, had not yet been committed; so he remained passive until the attack was really made, when he resolved that he would come to the rescue.</s> <s sid="64" id="forest.c15.s64">After some minutes of entreaty that they would open the door, the man in front commenced thumping and beating against it, as if he would make them open the door by force; but this was to attract the attention of those within, and divert it from the attempts that the other was making to get in behind.</s> <s sid="65" id="forest.c15.s65">Edward was aware of this; he now kept his eye upon what was going on at the back.</s> <s sid="66" id="forest.c15.s66">Advancing nearer--which he ventured to do now that both the men were so occupied--he perceived that the fellow had contrived to open the window close to the back door, and was remaining quite close to it with a pistol in his hand, apparently not wishing to run the risk of climbing in.</s> <s sid="67" id="forest.c15.s67">Edward slipped under the eaves of the cottage, not six feet from the man, who remained with his back partly turned to him.</s> <s sid="68" id="forest.c15.s68">Edward then, finding he had obtained this position unperceived, crouched down with his gun ready pointed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="forest.c15.p25" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="forest.c15.s69">As Edward remained in this position, he heard a shrill voice cry out, <qs/>"They are getting in behind!"<qe/> and a movement in cottage.</s> <s sid="70" id="forest.c15.s70">The man near him, who had his pistol in his hand, put his arm through the window and fired inside.</s> <s sid="71" id="forest.c15.s71">A shriek was given, and Edward fired his gun into the body of the man, who immediately fell.</s> <s sid="72" id="forest.c15.s72">Edward lost no time in reloading his gun, during which he heard the bursting open of the front door and the report of firearms; then all was silent for a moment, excepting the wailing of somebody within.</s> <s sid="73" id="forest.c15.s73">As soon as his gun was reloaded, Edward walked round to the front of the cottage, where he found the man who was called Ben, lying across the threshold of the open door.</s> <s sid="74" id="forest.c15.s74">He stepped across the body, and, looking into the room within, perceived a body stretched on the floor, and a young lad weeping over it.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="forest.c15.p26" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="forest.c15.s75"><qs/>"Don't be alarmed, I am a friend,"<qe/> said Edward, going in to where the body lay; and, taking the light which was at the farther end of the chamber, he placed it on the floor, that he might examine the state of the person, who was breathing heavily, and apparently badly wounded.</s> <s sid="76" id="forest.c15.s76"><qs/>"Rise up, my lad,"<qe/><sss/> said Edward, <sse/><qs/>"and let me see if I can be of any use."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="forest.c15.p27" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="forest.c15.s77"><qs/>"Ah, no!"<qe/><sls/> cried the boy, throwing back his long hair from his temples, <sle/><qs/>"he bleeds to death!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="forest.c15.p28" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="forest.c15.s78"><qs/>"Bring me some water, quick,"<qe/><sss/> said Edward, <sse/><qs/>"there's a good lad, while I see where he is hurt."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="forest.c15.p29" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="forest.c15.s79">The boy ran up to fetch the water, and Edward discovered that the ball had entered the neck above the collar-bone, and that the blood poured out of the man's mouth, who was choking with the effusion.</s> <s sid="80" id="forest.c15.s80">Although ignorant of surgery, Edward thought that such a wound must be mortal; but the man was not only alive but sensible, and although he could not utter a word, he spoke with his eyes and with signs.</s> <s sid="81" id="forest.c15.s81">He raised his hand and pointed to himself first, and shook his head, as if to say that it was all over with him; and then he turned round his head, as if looking for the lad, who was now returning with the water.</s> <s sid="82" id="forest.c15.s82">When the lad again knelt by his side, weeping bitterly, the man pointed to him, and gave such an imploring look that Edward immediately comprehended what he wished: it was to ask protection for the boy.</s> <s sid="83" id="forest.c15.s83">It could not be misunderstood, and could Edward do otherwise than promise it to the dying man?</s> <s sid="84" id="forest.c15.s84">His generous nature could not refuse it, and he said, <qs/>"I understand you; you wish me to take care of your boy when you are gone.</s> <s sid="85" id="forest.c15.s85">Is it not so?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="forest.c15.p30"><s sid="86" id="forest.c15.s86">The man signified assent.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="forest.c15.p32"><s sid="89" id="forest.c15.s89">The man raised his hand again, and a gleam of joy passed over his features, as he took the hand of the lad and put it into that of Edward.</s> <s sid="90" id="forest.c15.s90">His eyes were then fixed upon Edward as if to scrutinize into his character by his features, while the former bathed his temples and washed the blood from his mouth with the water brought by the boy, who appeared in a state of grief so violent as to paralyze his senses.</s> <s sid="91" id="forest.c15.s91">After a minute or two, another effusion of blood choked the wounded man, who, after a short struggle, fell back dead.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="forest.c16.p11"><s sid="34" id="forest.c16.s34">The boy knelt down, kissed the forehead and cold lips, covered up the face again, and then rose and wept bitterly on Edward's shoulder.</s> <s sid="35" id="forest.c16.s35">Edward did not attempt to check his sorrow, he thought it better it should have vent; but, after a time, he led the boy by degrees till they were out of the cottage.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="forest.c16.p15"><s sid="40" id="forest.c16.s40">And so it proved to be; and it required all the united efforts of Billy, Edward, and Pablo to force a passage for the cart through the narrow pathway; but at last it was effected, and then they went on at a quick pace, and in less than two hours the cottage was in sight.</s> <s sid="41" id="forest.c16.s41">When within two hundred yards of it, Edith, who had been on the watch, came bounding out, and flew into Edward's arms, and covered him with kisses.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="forest.c21.p4"><s sid="24" id="forest.c21.s24">Before daylight they went with the dogs and a large bundle of hay, which they strewed nearer to the mound of drift-snow.</s> <s sid="25" id="forest.c21.s25">They then tied the dogs up on each side, ordering them to lie down and be quiet.</s> <s sid="26" id="forest.c21.s26">They then walked through the thicket so as not to be perceived, until they considered that they were far enough from the drift-snow.</s> <s sid="27" id="forest.c21.s27">About daylight, the herd came to pick up the hay as usual, and after they had passed them Humphrey and Pablo followed in the thicket, not wishing to show themselves till the last moment.</s> <s sid="28" id="forest.c21.s28">While the ponies were busy with the hay, they suddenly ran out into the avenue and separated, so as to prevent the ponies from attempting to gallop past them.</s> <s sid="29" id="forest.c21.s29">Shouting as loud they could, as they ran up to the ponies, and calling to the dogs, who immediately set up barking on each side, the ponies, alarmed at the noise and the appearance of Humphrey and Pablo, naturally set off in the only direction which appeared to them to be clear, and galloped away over the mound of drift-snow, with their tails streaming, snorting and plunging in the snow as they hurried along; but as soon as they arrived at the mound of drift-snow, they plunged first up to their bellies, and afterward, as they attempted to force their way where the snow was deeper, many of them stuck fast altogether, and attempted to clear themselves in vain.</s> <s sid="30" id="forest.c21.s30">Humphrey and Pablo, who had followed them as fast as they could run, now came up with them and threw the lasso over the neck of one, and ropes with slip-nooses over two more, which were floundering in the snow there together.</s> <s sid="31" id="forest.c21.s31">The remainder of the herd, after great exertions, got clear of the snow by turning round and galloping back through the avenue.</s> <s sid="32" id="forest.c21.s32">The three ponies captured made a furious struggle, but by drawing the ropes tight round their necks they were choked, and soon unable to move.</s> <s sid="33" id="forest.c21.s33">They then tied their fore-legs, and loosed the ropes round their necks, that they might recover their breath.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="forest.c21.p5" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="forest.c21.s34"><qs/>"Got them now, Massa Humphrey,"<qe/> said Pablo.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="forest.c21.p7" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="forest.c21.s36"><qs/>"Suppose they no eat to-day and to-morrow, get very tame."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="forest.c21.p8" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="forest.c21.s37"><qs/>"I believe that will be the best way; they can not get loose again, do all they can."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="forest.c21.p10"><s sid="40" id="forest.c21.s40">Pablo then put the halter on, and tied the end short to the fore-leg of the pony, so that it could not walk without keeping its head close to the ground--if it raised its head, it was obliged to lift up its leg.</s> <s sid="41" id="forest.c21.s41">Then he put the lasso round its neck, to choke it if it was too unruly, and having done that, he cast loose the ropes which had tied its fore-legs together.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="forest.c21.p11" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="forest.c21.s42"><qs/>"Now, Massa Humphrey, we get him home somehow.</s> <s sid="43" id="forest.c21.s43">First I go loose the dogs; he 'fraid of the dogs, and run t'other way."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="forest.c21.p12"><s sid="44" id="forest.c21.s44">The pony, which was an iron-gray and very handsome, plunged furiously and kicked behind, but it could not do so without falling down, which it did several times before Pablo returned with the dogs.</s> <s sid="45" id="forest.c21.s45">Humphrey held one part of the lasso on one side, and Pablo on the other, keeping the pony between them; and with the dogs barking at it behind, they contrived, with a great deal of exertion and trouble, to get the pony to the cottage.</s> <s sid="46" id="forest.c21.s46">The poor animal, driven in this way on three legs, and every now and then choked with the lasso, was covered with foam before they arrived.</s> <s sid="47" id="forest.c21.s47">Billy was turned out of his stable to make room for the new-comer, who was fastened securely to the manger and then left without food, that he might become tame.</s> <s sid="48" id="forest.c21.s48">It was too late then, and they were too tired themselves to go for the other two ponies; so they were left lying on the snow all night, and the next morning they found they were much tamer than the first; and during the day, following the same plan, they were both brought to the stable and secured alongside of the other.</s> <s sid="49" id="forest.c21.s49">One was a bay pony with black legs, and the other a brown one.</s> <s sid="50" id="forest.c21.s50">The bay pony was a mare, and the other two horses.</s> <s sid="51" id="forest.c21.s51">Alice and Edith were delighted with the new ponies, and Humphrey was not a little pleased that he had succeeded in capturing them, after what had passed between Edward and him.</s> <s sid="52" id="forest.c21.s52">After two days' fasting, the poor animals were so tame that they ate out of Pablo's hand, and submitted to be stroked and caressed; and before they were a fortnight in the stable, Alice and Edith could go up to them without danger.</s> <s sid="53" id="forest.c21.s53">They were soon broken in; for the yard being full of muck, Pablo took them into it and mounted them.</s> <s sid="54" id="forest.c21.s54">They plunged and kicked at first, and tried all they could to get rid of him, but they sunk so deep into the muck that they were soon tired out; and after a month, they were all three tolerably quiet to ride.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="forest.c21.p13"><s sid="55" id="forest.c21.s55">The snow was so deep all over the country that there was little communication with the metropolis.</s> <s sid="56" id="forest.c21.s56">The intendant's letters spoke of King Charles raising another army in Holland, and that his adherents in England were preparing to join him as soon at he marched southward.</s> </p>
