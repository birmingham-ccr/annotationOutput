<qe/><title>CHAPTER I. The Book of Beasts</title>
<p pid="1" id="dragons.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="dragons.c1.s1">He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the news was rather remarkable news.</s> <s sid="2" id="dragons.c1.s2">You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dragons.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="dragons.c1.s3">And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, <qs/>"Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dragons.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="dragons.c1.s4">Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, <qs/>"Oh, don't, Nurse,"<qe/><sss/> and, <sse/><qs/>"I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"<qe/><sss/> or, <sse/><qs/>"Never mind my hair, it's all right,"<qe/><sss/> and, <sse/><qs/>"That'll do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dragons.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="dragons.c1.s5"><qs/>"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"<qe/> said Nurse.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dragons.c1.p5"><s sid="6" id="dragons.c1.s6">The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dragons.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="dragons.c1.s7">They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said:</s> <s sid="8" id="dragons.c1.s8"><qs/>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dragons.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="dragons.c1.s9"><qs/>"Yes, please, sir,"<qe/><sss/> said Lionel, <sse/><qs/>"when does it begin?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dragons.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="dragons.c1.s10"><qs/>"You will be crowned this afternoon,"<qe/> said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dragons.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="dragons.c1.s11"><qs/>"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"<qe/> said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dragons.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="dragons.c1.s12"><qs/>"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later.</s> <s sid="13" id="dragons.c1.s13">No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dragons.c1.p11"><s sid="14" id="dragons.c1.s14">The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived.</s> <s sid="15" id="dragons.c1.s15">It was No. 7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dragons.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="dragons.c1.s16">Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:</s> <s sid="17" id="dragons.c1.s17"><qs/>"Thank you for washing me.</s> <s sid="18" id="dragons.c1.s18">I wish I'd let you do the other ear.</s> <s sid="19" id="dragons.c1.s19">No--there's no time now.</s> <s sid="20" id="dragons.c1.s20">Give me the hanky.</s> <s sid="21" id="dragons.c1.s21">Good-bye, Nurse."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dragons.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="dragons.c1.s22"><qs/>"Good-bye, ducky,"<qe/> said Nurse.</s> <s sid="23" id="dragons.c1.s23"><qs/>"Be a good little King now, and say <alt-qs/>'please' and 'thank you,'<alt-qe/> and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dragons.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="dragons.c1.s24">So off went Lionel to be made a King.</s> <s sid="25" id="dragons.c1.s25">He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he had never even thought of it.</s> <s sid="26" id="dragons.c1.s26">And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming.</s> <s sid="27" id="dragons.c1.s27">Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, <qs/>"Long live Lionel!</s> <s sid="28" id="dragons.c1.s28">Long live our little King!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dragons.c1.p15"><s sid="29" id="dragons.c1.s29">He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that.</s> <s sid="30" id="dragons.c1.s30">If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dragons.c1.p16"><s sid="31" id="dragons.c1.s31">As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dragons.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="dragons.c1.s32"><qs/>"I thought we were a Republic,"<qe/> said Lionel.</s> <s sid="33" id="dragons.c1.s33"><qs/>"I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dragons.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="dragons.c1.s34"><qs/>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"<qe/><sss/> said the Prime Minister, <sse/><qs/>"and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much.</s> <s sid="35" id="dragons.c1.s35">You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dragons.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="dragons.c1.s36"><qs/>"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dragons.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="dragons.c1.s37"><qs/>"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books.</s> <s sid="38" id="dragons.c1.s38">He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond of books.</s> <s sid="39" id="dragons.c1.s39">Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dragons.c1.p21"><s sid="40" id="dragons.c1.s40">Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned.</s> <s sid="41" id="dragons.c1.s41">Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="dragons.c1.p22"><s sid="42" id="dragons.c1.s42">Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="dragons.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="dragons.c1.s43">After tea Lionel said:</s> <s sid="44" id="dragons.c1.s44"><qs/>"I think I should like a book.</s> <s sid="45" id="dragons.c1.s45">Will you get me one, Nurse?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dragons.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="dragons.c1.s46"><qs/>"Bless the child,"<qe/> said Nurse.</s> <s sid="47" id="dragons.c1.s47"><qs/>"You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King?</s> <s sid="48" id="dragons.c1.s48">Run along, do, and get your books yourself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dragons.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="dragons.c1.s49">So Lionel went down into the library.</s> <s sid="50" id="dragons.c1.s50">The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now--when Lionel cried out:</s> <s sid="51" id="dragons.c1.s51"><qs/>"Oh, what a worldful of books!</s> <s sid="52" id="dragons.c1.s52">Are they yours?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dragons.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="dragons.c1.s53"><qs/>"They are yours, Your Majesty,"<qe/> answered the Chancellor.</s> <s sid="54" id="dragons.c1.s54"><qs/>"They were the property of the late King, your great-great--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="dragons.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="dragons.c1.s55"><qs/>"Yes, I know,"<qe/> Lionel interrupted.</s> <s sid="56" id="dragons.c1.s56"><qs/>"Well, I shall read them all.</s> <s sid="57" id="dragons.c1.s57">I love to read.</s> <s sid="58" id="dragons.c1.s58">I am so glad I learned to read."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="dragons.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="dragons.c1.s59"><qs/>"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"<qe/><sss/> said the Prime Minister, <sse/><qs/>"I should not read these books.</s> <s sid="60" id="dragons.c1.s60">Your great--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="dragons.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="dragons.c1.s61"><qs/>"Yes?"<qe/> said Lionel, quickly.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="dragons.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="dragons.c1.s62"><qs/>"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little--well, strange."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dragons.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="dragons.c1.s63"><qs/>"Mad?"<qe/> asked Lionel, cheerfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dragons.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="dragons.c1.s64"><qs/>"No, no"<qe/>--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked.</s> <s sid="65" id="dragons.c1.s65"><qs/>"Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was--er--too clever by half.</s> <s sid="66" id="dragons.c1.s66">And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dragons.c1.p33"><s sid="67" id="dragons.c1.s67">Lionel looked puzzled.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dragons.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="dragons.c1.s68"><qs/>"The fact is,"<qe/><sls/> the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, <sle/><qs/>"your great--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="dragons.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="dragons.c1.s69"><qs/>"Go on,"<qe/> said Lionel.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="dragons.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="dragons.c1.s70"><qs/>"--was called a wizard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="dragons.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="dragons.c1.s71"><qs/>"But he wasn't?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="dragons.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="dragons.c1.s72"><qs/>"Of course not--a most worthy King was your great--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="dragons.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="dragons.c1.s73"><qs/>"I see."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="dragons.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="dragons.c1.s74"><qs/>"But I wouldn't touch his books."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="dragons.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="dragons.c1.s75"><qs/>"Just this one,"<qe/> cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table.</s> <s sid="76" id="dragons.c1.s76">It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="dragons.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="dragons.c1.s77"><qs/>"I must look at this one,"<qe/> Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read:</s> <s sid="78" id="dragons.c1.s78">_The Book of Beasts_.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="dragons.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="dragons.c1.s79">The Chancellor said, <qs/>"Don't be a silly little King."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="dragons.c1.p44"><s sid="80" id="dragons.c1.s80">But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="dragons.c1.p45" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="dragons.c1.s81"><qs/>"There,"<qe/><sss/> said Lionel, <sse/><qs/>"Isn't that lovely?</s> <s sid="82" id="dragons.c1.s82">Why--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="dragons.c1.p46"><s sid="83" id="dragons.c1.s83">But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="dragons.c1.p47" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="dragons.c1.s84"><qs/>"Well!"<qe/><sls/> said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, <sle/><qs/>"that's magic, that is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="dragons.c1.p48" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="dragons.c1.s85">But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him.</s> <s sid="86" id="dragons.c1.s86">Under him was written, <qs/>"Blue Bird of Paradise,"<qe/> and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="dragons.c1.p49" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="dragons.c1.s87">Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf.</s> <s sid="88" id="dragons.c1.s88">And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:</s> <s sid="89" id="dragons.c1.s89"><qs/>"You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"<qe/> and was very angry indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="dragons.c1.p50" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="dragons.c1.s90"><qs/>"I don't see that I've done any harm,"<qe/> said Lionel.</s> <s sid="91" id="dragons.c1.s91">He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="dragons.c1.p51" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="dragons.c1.s92"><qs/>"No harm?"<qe/> said the Chancellor.</s> <s sid="93" id="dragons.c1.s93"><qs/>"Ah--but what do you know about it?</s> <s sid="94" id="dragons.c1.s94">That's the question.</s> <s sid="95" id="dragons.c1.s95">How do you know what might have been on the next page--a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="dragons.c1.p52" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="dragons.c1.s96"><qs/>"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"<qe/> said Lionel.</s> <s sid="97" id="dragons.c1.s97"><qs/>"Come, let's kiss and be friends."<qe/></s> <s sid="98" id="dragons.c1.s98">So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="dragons.c1.p53"><s sid="99" id="dragons.c1.s99">But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got _The Book of Beasts_.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="dragons.c1.p54" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="dragons.c1.s100">He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with "Butterfly" and "Blue Bird of Paradise" underneath, and then he turned the next page.</s> <s sid="101" id="dragons.c1.s101">There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written <qs/>"Dragon."<qe/></s> <s sid="102" id="dragons.c1.s102">The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="dragons.c1.p55"><s sid="103" id="dragons.c1.s103">But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with "Dragon" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page.</s> <s sid="104" id="dragons.c1.s104">And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="dragons.c1.p56"><s sid="105" id="dragons.c1.s105">And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it.</s> <s sid="106" id="dragons.c1.s106">He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out.</s> <s sid="107" id="dragons.c1.s107">And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="dragons.c1.p57"><s sid="108" id="dragons.c1.s108">Lionel began to cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="dragons.c1.p60" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="dragons.c1.s115"><qs/>"Perhaps, my Lord,"<qe/><sss/> said the Prime Minister, <sse/><qs/>"we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="dragons.c1.p61" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="dragons.c1.s116">Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said:</s> <s sid="117" id="dragons.c1.s117"><qs/>"It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="dragons.c1.p62"><s sid="118" id="dragons.c1.s118">But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel.</s> <s sid="119" id="dragons.c1.s119">They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done.</s> <s sid="120" id="dragons.c1.s120">Everyone did what they could.</s> <s sid="121" id="dragons.c1.s121">They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done.</s> <s sid="122" id="dragons.c1.s122">The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty.</s> <s sid="123" id="dragons.c1.s123">Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="dragons.c1.p63" type="speech"><s sid="124" id="dragons.c1.s124"><qs/>"You are a naughty little King,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"and nobody will love you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="dragons.c1.p64"><s sid="125" id="dragons.c1.s125">Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly.</s> <s sid="126" id="dragons.c1.s126">So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="dragons.c1.p65" type="speech"><s sid="127" id="dragons.c1.s127">And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible--which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake.</s> <s sid="128" id="dragons.c1.s128">So when he said:</s> <s sid="129" id="dragons.c1.s129"><qs/>"There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"<qe/>--he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half--the grown-up half--pretended to think he was quite right.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="dragons.c1.p66"><s sid="130" id="dragons.c1.s130">Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat.</s> <s sid="131" id="dragons.c1.s131">And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="dragons.c4.p52" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="dragons.c4.s108">George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, <qs/>"No, I shan't.</s> <s sid="109" id="dragons.c4.s109">The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday--I heard Father say so--so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow.</s> <s sid="110" id="dragons.c4.s110">I'm very sorry; but I can't--so there!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dragons.c5.p2"><s sid="6" id="dragons.c5.s6">Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King.</s> <s sid="7" id="dragons.c5.s7">And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch.</s> <s sid="8" id="dragons.c5.s8">So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all.</s> <s sid="9" id="dragons.c5.s9">The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dragons.c5.p26"><s sid="40" id="dragons.c5.s40">The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dragons.c5.p34" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="dragons.c5.s55"><qs/>"Oh, tell me what,"<qe/> said the Queen.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="dragons.c5.p38"><s sid="63" id="dragons.c5.s63">So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children.</s> <s sid="64" id="dragons.c5.s64">Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail.</s> <s sid="65" id="dragons.c5.s65">But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="dragons.c5.p39"><s sid="66" id="dragons.c5.s66">When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible.</s> <s sid="67" id="dragons.c5.s67">It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl.</s> <s sid="68" id="dragons.c5.s68">When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="dragons.c5.p41"><s sid="75" id="dragons.c5.s75">And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="dragons.c5.p42" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="dragons.c5.s76"><qs/>"Very well, madam,"<qe/><sss/> said the King, <sse/><qs/>"very well--have your own way.</s> <s sid="77" id="dragons.c5.s77">And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="dragons.c5.p44"><s sid="81" id="dragons.c5.s81">The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him.</s> <s sid="82" id="dragons.c5.s82">He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners.</s> <s sid="83" id="dragons.c5.s83">The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish.</s> <s sid="84" id="dragons.c5.s84">It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="dragons.c5.p45" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="dragons.c5.s85"><qs/>"A girl indeed!"<qe/> said the King angrily.</s> <s sid="86" id="dragons.c5.s86"><qs/>"I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="dragons.c5.p46" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="dragons.c5.s87"><qs/>"You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"<qe/> said the Princess.</s> <s sid="88" id="dragons.c5.s88">She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="dragons.c5.p47" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="dragons.c5.s89">The King could not utter a word for several minutes.</s> <s sid="90" id="dragons.c5.s90">He was too angry.</s> <s sid="91" id="dragons.c5.s91">But the Queen said, <qs/>"My dear child, don't interfere,"<qe/> quite crossly, for she was frightened.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="dragons.c5.p48" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="dragons.c5.s92">And to her husband she said, <qs/>"My dear, why do you go on worrying about it?</s> <s sid="93" id="dragons.c5.s93">Our daughter is not a boy, it is true--but she may marry a clever man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever you cared to teach him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="dragons.c5.p49"><s sid="94" id="dragons.c5.s94">Then the King found his tongue.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="dragons.c5.p50" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="dragons.c5.s95"><qs/>"If she does marry,"<qe/><sss/> he said, slowly, <sse/><qs/>"her husband will have to be a very clever man--oh, yes, very clever indeed!</s> <s sid="96" id="dragons.c5.s96">And he will have to know a very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="dragons.c5.p51"><s sid="97" id="dragons.c5.s97">The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be disagreeable.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="dragons.c5.p57"><s sid="114" id="dragons.c5.s114">The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her.</s> <s sid="115" id="dragons.c5.s115">And the witch came, and the Queen told her all.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>CHAPTER VI. The Dragon Tamers</title>
<p pid="1" id="dragons.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="dragons.c6.s1">There was once an old, old castle--it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge.</s> <s sid="2" id="dragons.c6.s2">He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year.</s> <s sid="3" id="dragons.c6.s3">So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way.</s> <s sid="4" id="dragons.c6.s4">This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him.</s> <s sid="5" id="dragons.c6.s5">So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor.</s> <s sid="6" id="dragons.c6.s6">John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was.</s> <s sid="7" id="dragons.c6.s7">The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle.</s> <s sid="8" id="dragons.c6.s8">It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where.</s> <s sid="9" id="dragons.c6.s9">Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back.</s> <s sid="10" id="dragons.c6.s10">The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I--so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dragons.c6.p2"><s sid="11" id="dragons.c6.s11">John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby.</s> <s sid="12" id="dragons.c6.s12">When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole.</s> <s sid="13" id="dragons.c6.s13">And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dragons.c6.p3"><s sid="14" id="dragons.c6.s14">As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all.</s> <s sid="15" id="dragons.c6.s15">This made her very tired.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dragons.c6.p4"><s sid="16" id="dragons.c6.s16">The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't.</s> <s sid="17" id="dragons.c6.s17">So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dragons.c6.p5"><s sid="18" id="dragons.c6.s18">One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge.</s> <s sid="19" id="dragons.c6.s19">He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set.</s> <s sid="20" id="dragons.c6.s20">This was the only order John had had that week.</s> <s sid="21" id="dragons.c6.s21">And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dragons.c6.p6"><s sid="22" id="dragons.c6.s22">Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound.</s> <s sid="23" id="dragons.c6.s23">The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dragons.c6.p7" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="dragons.c6.s24"><qs/>"I heard nothing,"<qe/> said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dragons.c6.p8" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="dragons.c6.s25"><qs/>"Neither did I,"<qe/> said she.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dragons.c6.p9"><s sid="26" id="dragons.c6.s26">But the noise grew louder--and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby--a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dragons.c6.p10"><s sid="27" id="dragons.c6.s27">But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to.</s> <s sid="28" id="dragons.c6.s28">It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring--and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dragons.c6.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="dragons.c6.s29"><qs/>"It can't be anything in the dungeon,"<qe/> said the blacksmith, wiping his face.</s> <s sid="30" id="dragons.c6.s30"><qs/>"Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dragons.c6.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="dragons.c6.s31"><qs/>"There isn't anything there, of course.</s> <s sid="32" id="dragons.c6.s32">How could there be?"<qe/> said his wife.</s> <s sid="33" id="dragons.c6.s33">And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dragons.c6.p13"><s sid="34" id="dragons.c6.s34">Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dragons.c6.p14" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="dragons.c6.s35"><qs/>"I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dragons.c6.p15" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="dragons.c6.s36"><qs/>"I quite understand,"<qe/> said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dragons.c6.p16"><s sid="37" id="dragons.c6.s37">So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual.</s> <s sid="38" id="dragons.c6.s38">Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals.</s> <s sid="39" id="dragons.c6.s39">But the other side was not empty.</s> <s sid="40" id="dragons.c6.s40">It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dragons.c6.p17" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="dragons.c6.s41"><qs/>"It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows where,"<qe/> said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding stairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dragons.c6.p18"><s sid="42" id="dragons.c6.s42">But the dragon was too quick for him--it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dragons.c6.p19" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="dragons.c6.s43"><qs/>"No you don't,"<qe/> said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dragons.c6.p20" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="dragons.c6.s44"><qs/>"Deary, deary me,"<qe/> said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw of the dragon.</s> <s sid="45" id="dragons.c6.s45"><qs/>"Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dragons.c6.p21"><s sid="46" id="dragons.c6.s46">The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="dragons.c6.p22" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="dragons.c6.s47"><qs/>"Do you mind saying that again?"<qe/> said he, quite politely.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="dragons.c6.p23" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="dragons.c6.s48">So John said again, very distinctly:</s> <s sid="49" id="dragons.c6.s49"><qs/>"_Here_--_is_--_a_--_nice_--_end_--_for_--_a_--_respectable_--_blacksmith._"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dragons.c6.p24" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="dragons.c6.s50"><qs/>"I didn't know,"<qe/> said the dragon.</s> <s sid="51" id="dragons.c6.s51"><qs/>"Fancy now!</s> <s sid="52" id="dragons.c6.s52">You're the very man I wanted."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dragons.c6.p25" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="dragons.c6.s53"><qs/>"So I understood you to say before,"<qe/> said John, his teeth chattering.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dragons.c6.p26" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="dragons.c6.s54"><qs/>"Oh, I don't mean what you mean,"<qe/><sss/> said the dragon, <sse/><qs/>"but I should like you to do a job for me.</s> <s sid="55" id="dragons.c6.s55">One of my wings has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint.</s> <s sid="56" id="dragons.c6.s56">Could you put that to rights?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="dragons.c6.p27" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="dragons.c6.s57"><qs/>"I might, sir,"<qe/> said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="dragons.c6.p28" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="dragons.c6.s58"><qs/>"A master craftsman--you are a master, of course?--can see in a minute what's wrong,"<qe/> the dragon went on.</s> <s sid="59" id="dragons.c6.s59"><qs/>"Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="dragons.c6.p29"><s sid="60" id="dragons.c6.s60">John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="dragons.c6.p30"><s sid="61" id="dragons.c6.s61">The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor--a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt--and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dragons.c6.p31"><s sid="62" id="dragons.c6.s62">All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dragons.c6.p32" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="dragons.c6.s63"><qs/>"You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="64" id="dragons.c6.s64"><qs/>"In fact, you want a good many."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dragons.c6.p33" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="dragons.c6.s65"><qs/>"Well, get to work, then,"<qe/> said the dragon.</s> <s sid="66" id="dragons.c6.s66"><qs/>"You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last.</s> <s sid="67" id="dragons.c6.s67">There!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dragons.c6.p34" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="dragons.c6.s68"><qs/>"I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"<qe/> said John.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="dragons.c6.p36" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="dragons.c6.s70"><qs/>"I don't want that, sir, either,"<qe/> said John.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dragons.c7.p25"><s sid="47" id="dragons.c7.s47">The Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses trotting and frisking behind him, and people got inside their houses as quickly as they could when they heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his horn.</s> <s sid="48" id="dragons.c7.s48">The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to hunt the dragon.</s> <s sid="49" id="dragons.c7.s49">Few of you who had not seen a pack of hippopotamuses in full cry will be able to imagine at all what the hunt was like.</s> <s sid="50" id="dragons.c7.s50">To begin with, hippopotamuses do not bay like hounds:</s> <s sid="51" id="dragons.c7.s51">They grunt like pigs, and their grunt is very big and fierce.</s> <s sid="52" id="dragons.c7.s52">Then, of course, no one expects hippopotamuses to jump.</s> <s sid="53" id="dragons.c7.s53">They just crash through the hedges and lumber through the standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and annoying the farmers very much.</s> <s sid="54" id="dragons.c7.s54">All the hippopotamuses had collars with their name and address on, but when the farmers called at the palace to complain of the injury to their standing crops, the Prince always said it served them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's way, and he never paid anything at all.</s> </p>
