<p pid="1" id="huckleberry.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="huckleberry.c1.s1">YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.</s> <s sid="2" id="huckleberry.c1.s2">That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.</s> <s sid="3" id="huckleberry.c1.s3">There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.</s> <s sid="4" id="huckleberry.c1.s4">That is nothing.</s> <s sid="5" id="huckleberry.c1.s5">I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.</s> <s sid="6" id="huckleberry.c1.s6">Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="huckleberry.c1.p2"><s sid="7" id="huckleberry.c1.s7">Now the way that the book winds up is this:</s> <s sid="8" id="huckleberry.c1.s8">Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.</s> <s sid="9" id="huckleberry.c1.s9">We got six thousand dollars apiece--all gold.</s> <s sid="10" id="huckleberry.c1.s10">It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up.</s> <s sid="11" id="huckleberry.c1.s11">Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round--more than a body could tell what to do with.</s> <s sid="12" id="huckleberry.c1.s12">The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out.</s> <s sid="13" id="huckleberry.c1.s13">I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied.</s> <s sid="14" id="huckleberry.c1.s14">But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.</s> <s sid="15" id="huckleberry.c1.s15">So I went back.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="huckleberry.c1.p3"><s sid="16" id="huckleberry.c1.s16">The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.</s> <s sid="17" id="huckleberry.c1.s17">She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.</s> <s sid="18" id="huckleberry.c1.s18">Well, then, the old thing commenced again.</s> <s sid="19" id="huckleberry.c1.s19">The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.</s> <s sid="20" id="huckleberry.c1.s20">When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.</s> <s sid="21" id="huckleberry.c1.s21">In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="huckleberry.c1.p4"><s sid="22" id="huckleberry.c1.s22">After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="huckleberry.c1.p5"><s sid="23" id="huckleberry.c1.s23">Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.</s> <s sid="24" id="huckleberry.c1.s24">But she wouldn't.</s> <s sid="25" id="huckleberry.c1.s25">She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more.</s> <s sid="26" id="huckleberry.c1.s26">That is just the way with some people.</s> <s sid="27" id="huckleberry.c1.s27">They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.</s> <s sid="28" id="huckleberry.c1.s28">Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it.</s> <s sid="29" id="huckleberry.c1.s29">And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="huckleberry.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="huckleberry.c1.s30">Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.</s> <s sid="31" id="huckleberry.c1.s31">She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up.</s> <s sid="32" id="huckleberry.c1.s32">I couldn't stood it much longer.</s> <s sid="33" id="huckleberry.c1.s33">Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.</s> <s sid="34" id="huckleberry.c1.s34">Miss Watson would say, <qs/>"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Don't scrunch up like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;"<qe/><sls/> and pretty soon she would say, <sle/><qs/>"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to behave?"<qe/></s> <s sid="35" id="huckleberry.c1.s35">Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there.</s> <s sid="36" id="huckleberry.c1.s36">She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.</s> <s sid="37" id="huckleberry.c1.s37">All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.</s> <s sid="38" id="huckleberry.c1.s38">She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.</s> <s sid="39" id="huckleberry.c1.s39">Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.</s> <s sid="40" id="huckleberry.c1.s40">But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="huckleberry.c1.p7"><s sid="41" id="huckleberry.c1.s41">Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place.</s> <s sid="42" id="huckleberry.c1.s42">She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.</s> <s sid="43" id="huckleberry.c1.s43">So I didn't think much of it.</s> <s sid="44" id="huckleberry.c1.s44">But I never said so.</s> <s sid="45" id="huckleberry.c1.s45">I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.</s> <s sid="46" id="huckleberry.c1.s46">I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="huckleberry.c1.p8"><s sid="47" id="huckleberry.c1.s47">Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.</s> <s sid="48" id="huckleberry.c1.s48">By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed.</s> <s sid="49" id="huckleberry.c1.s49">I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table.</s> <s sid="50" id="huckleberry.c1.s50">Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.</s> <s sid="51" id="huckleberry.c1.s51">I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead.</s> <s sid="52" id="huckleberry.c1.s52">The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me.</s> <s sid="53" id="huckleberry.c1.s53">Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving.</s> <s sid="54" id="huckleberry.c1.s54">I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company.</s> <s sid="55" id="huckleberry.c1.s55">Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up.</s> <s sid="56" id="huckleberry.c1.s56">I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me.</s> <s sid="57" id="huckleberry.c1.s57">I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.</s> <s sid="58" id="huckleberry.c1.s58">But I hadn't no confidence.</s> <s sid="59" id="huckleberry.c1.s59">You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="huckleberry.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="huckleberry.c1.s60">I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know.</s> <s sid="61" id="huckleberry.c1.s61">Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than ever.</s> <s sid="62" id="huckleberry.c1.s62">Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees--something was a stirring.</s> <s sid="63" id="huckleberry.c1.s63">I set still and listened.</s> <s sid="64" id="huckleberry.c1.s64">Directly I could just barely hear a <qs/>"me-yow! me-yow!"<qe/> down there.</s> <s sid="65" id="huckleberry.c1.s65">That was good!</s> <s sid="66" id="huckleberry.c1.s66">Says I, <qs/>"me-yow! me-yow!"<qe/> as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.</s> <s sid="67" id="huckleberry.c1.s67">Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="huckleberry.c9.p2"><s sid="2" id="huckleberry.c9.s2">This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high.</s> <s sid="3" id="huckleberry.c9.s3">We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick.</s> <s sid="4" id="huckleberry.c9.s4">We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois.</s> <s sid="5" id="huckleberry.c9.s5">The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.</s> <s sid="6" id="huckleberry.c9.s6">It was cool in there.</s> <s sid="7" id="huckleberry.c9.s7">Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="huckleberry.c9.p3"><s sid="8" id="huckleberry.c9.s8">Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs.</s> <s sid="9" id="huckleberry.c9.s9">And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="huckleberry.c9.p4"><s sid="10" id="huckleberry.c9.s10">So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there.</s> <s sid="11" id="huckleberry.c9.s11">Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.</s> <s sid="12" id="huckleberry.c9.s12">We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="huckleberry.c9.p5"><s sid="13" id="huckleberry.c9.s13">The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire on.</s> <s sid="14" id="huckleberry.c9.s14">So we built it there and cooked dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="huckleberry.c9.p6"><s sid="15" id="huckleberry.c9.s15">We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.</s> <s sid="16" id="huckleberry.c9.s16">We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.</s> <s sid="17" id="huckleberry.c9.s17">Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it.</s> <s sid="18" id="huckleberry.c9.s18">Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so.</s> <s sid="19" id="huckleberry.c9.s19">It was one of these regular summer storms.</s> <s sid="20" id="huckleberry.c9.s20">It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="huckleberry.c9.p7" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="huckleberry.c9.s21"><qs/>"Jim, this is nice,"<qe/> I says.</s> <s sid="22" id="huckleberry.c9.s22"><qs/>"I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here.</s> <s sid="23" id="huckleberry.c9.s23">Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="huckleberry.c9.p9"><s sid="27" id="huckleberry.c9.s27">The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks.</s> <s sid="28" id="huckleberry.c9.s28">The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.</s> <s sid="29" id="huckleberry.c9.s29">On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="huckleberry.c9.p10"><s sid="30" id="huckleberry.c9.s30">Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.</s> <s sid="31" id="huckleberry.c9.s31">We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way.</s> <s sid="32" id="huckleberry.c9.s32">Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would slide off in the water.</s> <s sid="33" id="huckleberry.c9.s33">The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.</s> <s sid="34" id="huckleberry.c9.s34">We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="huckleberry.c9.p11"><s sid="35" id="huckleberry.c9.s35">One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.</s> <s sid="36" id="huckleberry.c9.s36">It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.</s> <s sid="37" id="huckleberry.c9.s37">We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="huckleberry.c9.p12"><s sid="38" id="huckleberry.c9.s38">Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.</s> <s sid="39" id="huckleberry.c9.s39">She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable.</s> <s sid="40" id="huckleberry.c9.s40">We paddled out and got aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window.</s> <s sid="41" id="huckleberry.c9.s41">But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="huckleberry.c9.p13"><s sid="42" id="huckleberry.c9.s42">The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.</s> <s sid="43" id="huckleberry.c9.s43">Then we looked in at the window.</s> <s sid="44" id="huckleberry.c9.s44">We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall.</s> <s sid="45" id="huckleberry.c9.s45">There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man.</s> <s sid="46" id="huckleberry.c9.s46">So Jim says:</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="huckleberry.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="huckleberry.c9.s47"><qs/>"Hello, you!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="huckleberry.c9.p15"><s sid="48" id="huckleberry.c9.s48">But it didn't budge.</s> <s sid="49" id="huckleberry.c9.s49">So I hollered again, and then Jim says:</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="huckleberry.c9.p19"><s sid="58" id="huckleberry.c9.s58">I didn't look at him at all.</s> <s sid="59" id="huckleberry.c9.s59">Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.</s> <s sid="60" id="huckleberry.c9.s60">There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.</s> <s sid="61" id="huckleberry.c9.s61">There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.</s> <s sid="62" id="huckleberry.c9.s62">We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.</s> <s sid="63" id="huckleberry.c9.s63">There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.</s> <s sid="64" id="huckleberry.c9.s64">And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck.</s> <s sid="65" id="huckleberry.c9.s65">We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.</s> <s sid="66" id="huckleberry.c9.s66">There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.</s> <s sid="67" id="huckleberry.c9.s67">They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.</s> <s sid="68" id="huckleberry.c9.s68">The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="huckleberry.c9.p20"><s sid="69" id="huckleberry.c9.s69">We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.</s> <s sid="70" id="huckleberry.c9.s70">The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, though we hunted all around.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="huckleberry.c9.p21"><s sid="71" id="huckleberry.c9.s71">And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.</s> <s sid="72" id="huckleberry.c9.s72">When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off.</s> <s sid="73" id="huckleberry.c9.s73">I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it.</s> <s sid="74" id="huckleberry.c9.s74">I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody.</s> <s sid="75" id="huckleberry.c9.s75">We got home all safe.</s> </p>

Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.</s> <s sid="6" id="huckleberry.c18.s6">His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders.</s> <s sid="7" id="huckleberry.c18.s7">His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.</s> <s sid="8" id="huckleberry.c18.s8">He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.</s> <s sid="9" id="huckleberry.c18.s9">There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.</s> <s sid="10" id="huckleberry.c18.s10">He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence.</s> <s sid="11" id="huckleberry.c18.s11">Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.</s> <s sid="12" id="huckleberry.c18.s12">He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered where he was.</s> <s sid="13" id="huckleberry.c18.s13">Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.</s> <s sid="14" id="huckleberry.c18.s14">When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.</s> </p>
