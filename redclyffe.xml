<p pid="2" id="redclyffe.c28.p2"><s sid="3" id="redclyffe.c28.s3">Kilcoran was about twenty miles from Cork, and Captain Morville was engaged to go and spend a day or two there.</s> <s sid="4" id="redclyffe.c28.s4">Maurice de Courcy drove him thither, wishing all the way for some other companion, since no one ever ventured to smoke a cigar in the proximity of 'Morville'; and, besides, Maurice's conversational powers were obliged to be entirely bestowed on his horse and dog, for the captain, instead of, as usual, devoting himself to suit his talk to his audience, was wrapped in the deepest meditation, now and then taking out a letter and referring to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="redclyffe.c28.p3"><s sid="5" id="redclyffe.c28.s5">This letter was the reply jointly compounded by Mr. Edmonstone and Charles, and the subject of his consideration was, whether he should accept the invitation to the wedding.</s> <s sid="6" id="redclyffe.c28.s6">Charles had taken care fully to explain how the truth respecting the cheque had come out, and Philip could no longer suspect that it had been a fabrication of Dixon's; but while Guy persisted in denial of any answer about the thousand pounds, he thought the renewal of the engagement extremely imprudent.</s> <s sid="7" id="redclyffe.c28.s7">He was very sorry for poor little Amy, for her comfort and happiness were, he thought, placed in the utmost jeopardy, with such a hot temper, under the most favourable circumstances; and there was the further peril, that when the novelty of the life with her at Redclyffe had passed off, Guy might seek for excitement in the dissipation to which his uncle had probably already introduced him.</s> <s sid="8" id="redclyffe.c28.s8">In the four years' probation, he saw the only hope of steadying Guy, or of saving Amy, and he was much concerned at the rejection of his advice, entirely for their sakes, for he could not condescend to be affronted at the scornful, satirical tone towards himself, in which Charles's little spitefulness was so fully apparent.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="redclyffe.c28.p4"><s sid="9" id="redclyffe.c28.s9">The wedding was a regular sacrifice, and Amabel was nothing but a victim; but an invitation to Hollywell had a charm for him that he scarcely could resist.</s> <s sid="10" id="redclyffe.c28.s10">To see Laura again, after having parted, as he thought, for so many years, delighted him in anticipation; and it would manifest his real interest in his young cousins, and show that he was superior to taking offence at the folly of Charles or his father.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="redclyffe.c28.p5"><s sid="11" id="redclyffe.c28.s11">These were his first thoughts and inclinations; his second were, that it was contrary to his principles to sanction so foolish and hasty a marriage by his presence; that he should thus be affording a triumph to Guy, and to one who would use it less moderately--to Charles.</s> <s sid="12" id="redclyffe.c28.s12">It would be more worthy of himself, more consistent with his whole course of conduct, to refuse his presence, instead of going amongst them when they were all infatuated, and unable to listen to sober counsel.</s> <s sid="13" id="redclyffe.c28.s13">If he stayed away now, when Guy should have justified his opinion, they would all own how wisely he had acted, and would see the true dignity which had refused, unlike common minds, to let his complaisance draw him into giving any sanction to what he so strongly disapproved.</s> <s sid="14" id="redclyffe.c28.s14">Laura, too, would pass through this trying time better if she was not distracted by watching him; she would understand the cause of his absence, and he could trust her to love and comprehend him at a distance, better than he could trust her to hear the marriage-service in his presence without betraying herself.</s> <s sid="15" id="redclyffe.c28.s15">Nor did he wish to hear her again plead for the confession of their engagement; and, supposing any misadventure should lead to its betrayal, what could be more unpleasant than for it to be revealed at such a time, when Charles would so turn it against him, that all his influence and usefulness would be for ever at an end?</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="redclyffe.c37.p30"><s sid="83" id="redclyffe.c37.s83">The tears would have their course; she could not restrain them when once they began, and her struggles to check them only brought an increase of them.</s> <s sid="84" id="redclyffe.c37.s84">Her sobs grew so violent that Laura, much alarmed, made a sign to Charlotte to fetch her mother; and Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in haste, found it was indeed the beginning of a frightful hysterical attack.</s> <s sid="85" id="redclyffe.c37.s85">The bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firmness and composure, and now nature asserted her rights; the hysterics returned again and again, and when it seemed as if exhaustion had at length produced quiet, the opening of a door, or a sound in the distance, would renew all again.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="redclyffe.c37.p31"><s sid="86" id="redclyffe.c37.s86">It was not till night had closed in that Mrs. Edmonstone was at all satisfied about her, and had at length the comfort of seeing her fall into a sound deep sleep; such an unbroken dreamless sleep as had scarcely visited her since she first went to Recoara.</s> <s sid="87" id="redclyffe.c37.s87">Even this sleep did not restore her; she became very unwell, and both Dr. Mayerne and her mother insisted on her avoiding the least exertion or agitation.</s> <s sid="88" id="redclyffe.c37.s88">She was quite submissive, only begging earnestly to be allowed to see Mr. Ross, saying she knew it would do her good rather than harm, and promising to let him leave her the instant she found it too much for her; and though Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid, they agreed that as she was so reasonable and docile, she ought to be allowed to judge for herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="redclyffe.c42.p6"><s sid="15" id="redclyffe.c42.s15">It ended in his referring the decision to Laura, who, disliking London, fearful for his health, eager for his glory, and reluctant to keep back such a champion from the battle, was much perplexed, only desirous to say what he wished, yet not able to make out what that might be.</s> <s sid="16" id="redclyffe.c42.s16">She carried her doubts to Charles and Amabel, who both pronounced that the thought of going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for him than any degree of employment--that occupation of the mind was the best thing for his spirits; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should be consulted.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="redclyffe.c42.p10"><s sid="29" id="redclyffe.c42.s29">The result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported that the new squire took on as much about poor Sir Guy as any one could do, and turned as pale as if he had been going into a swoon, when he spoke his name and gave Ben his message.</s> <s sid="30" id="redclyffe.c42.s30">And as to poor Ben, the old man said, he regularly did cry like a child, and small blame to him, to hear that Sir Guy had took thought of him at such a time and so far away; and he verily believed Ben could never take again to his bad ways, after such a message as that.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="redclyffe.c42.p11"><s sid="31" id="redclyffe.c42.s31">Markham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after and was even heard to mutter something about worshipping the rising sun, an act of idolatry of which he could not be accused, since it was in the most grudging manner that he allowed, that Mr. Morville's sole anxiety seemed to be to continue all Sir Guy had undertaken; while Mrs. Ashford, on the other hand was much affected by the account her cousin James had been giving her of the grief that he had suffered at Sir Guy's death, his long illness, his loss of spirits, the reluctance he had shown to come here at all, and his present unconquerable dread of going to the Park.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="redclyffe.c43.p7"><s sid="14" id="redclyffe.c43.s14">Amabel was not afraid of the sole charge of Charles or of the baby, for she had been taught but too well to manage for herself, she understood Charles very well, and had too much quiet good sense to be fanciful about her very healthy baby.</s> <s sid="15" id="redclyffe.c43.s15">Though she was inexperienced, with old nurse hard by, and Dr. Mayerne at Broadstone, there was no fear of her not having good counsel enough.</s> <s sid="16" id="redclyffe.c43.s16">She was glad to be of some use, by enabling her mother to leave Charles, and her only fear was of being dull company for him; but as he was so kind as to bear it, she would do her best, and perhaps their neighbours would come and enliven him sometimes.</s> </p>
