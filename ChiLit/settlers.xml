<title>CHAPTER 1. THE SETTLERS AT HOME.</title>
<p pid="1" id="settlers.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="settlers.c1.s1">Two hundred years ago, the Isle of Axholme was one of the most remarkable places in England.</s> <s sid="2" id="settlers.c1.s2">It is not an island in the sea.</s> <s sid="3" id="settlers.c1.s3">It is a part of Lincolnshire--a piece of land hilly in the middle, and surrounded by rivers.</s> <s sid="4" id="settlers.c1.s4">The Trent runs on the east side of it; and some smaller rivers formerly flowed round the rest of it, joining the Humber to the north.</s> <s sid="5" id="settlers.c1.s5">These rivers carried down a great deal of mud with them to the Humber, and the tides of the Humber washed up a great deal of sea-sand into the mouths of the rivers; so that the waters could not for some time flow freely, and were at last prevented from flowing away at all: they sank into the ground, and made a swamp of it--a swamp of many miles round the hilly part of the Isle of Axholme.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="settlers.c1.p2"><s sid="6" id="settlers.c1.s6">This swamp was long a very dismal place.</s> <s sid="7" id="settlers.c1.s7">Fish, and water-birds, and rats inhabited it: and here and there stood the hut of a fowler; or a peat-stack raised by the people who lived on the hills round, and who obtained their fuel from the peat-lands in the swamp.</s> <s sid="8" id="settlers.c1.s8">There were also, sprinkled over the district, a few very small houses--cells belonging to the Abbey of Saint Mary, at York.</s> <s sid="9" id="settlers.c1.s9">To these cells some of the monks from Saint Mary's had been fond of retiring, in old times, for meditation and prayer, and doing good in the district round; but when the soil became so swampy as to give them the ague as often as they paid a visit to these cells, the monks left off their practice of retiring hither; and their little dwellings stood empty, to be gradually overgrown with green moss and lank weeds, which no hand cleared away.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="settlers.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="settlers.c1.s10">At last a Dutchman, having seen what wonders were done in his own country by good draining, thought he could render this district fit to be inhabited and cultivated; and he made a bargain with the king about it.</s> <s sid="11" id="settlers.c1.s11">After spending much money, and taking great pains, he succeeded.</s> <s sid="12" id="settlers.c1.s12">He drew the waters off into new channels, and kept them there by sluices, and by carefully watching the embankments he had raised.</s> <s sid="13" id="settlers.c1.s13">The land which was left dry was manured and cultivated, till, instead of a reedy and mossy swamp, there were fields of clover and of corn, and meadows of the finest grass, with cattle and sheep grazing in large numbers.</s> <s sid="14" id="settlers.c1.s14">The dwellings that were still standing were made into farm-houses, and new farmhouses were built.</s> <s sid="15" id="settlers.c1.s15">A church here, and a chapel there was cleaned, and warmed, and painted, and opened for worship; and good roads crossed the district into all the counties near.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="settlers.c1.p4"><s sid="16" id="settlers.c1.s16">Instead of being pleased with this change, the people of the country were angry and discontented.</s> <s sid="17" id="settlers.c1.s17">Those who lived near had been long accustomed to fishing and fowling in the swamp, without paying any rent, or having to ask anybody's leave.</s> <s sid="18" id="settlers.c1.s18">They had no mind now to settle to the regular toilsome business of farming,--and to be under a landlord, to whom they must pay rent.</s> <s sid="19" id="settlers.c1.s19">Probably, too, they knew nothing about farming, and would have failed in it if they had tried.</s> <s sid="20" id="settlers.c1.s20">Thus far they were not to be blamed.</s> <s sid="21" id="settlers.c1.s21">But nothing can exceed the malignity with which they treated the tenants who did settle in the isle, and the spiteful spirit which they showed towards them, on every occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="settlers.c1.p5"><s sid="22" id="settlers.c1.s22">These tenants were chiefly foreigners.</s> <s sid="23" id="settlers.c1.s23">There was a civil war in England at that time: and the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire people were so much engaged in fighting for King Charles or for the Parliament, that fewer persons were at liberty to undertake new farms than there would have been in a time of peace.</s> <s sid="24" id="settlers.c1.s24">When the Dutchman and his companions found that the English were not disposed to occupy the Levels (as the drained lands were called), they encouraged some of their own countrymen to come over.</s> <s sid="25" id="settlers.c1.s25">With them arrived some few Frenchmen, who had been driven from France into Holland, on account of their being Protestants.</s> <s sid="26" id="settlers.c1.s26">From first to last, there were about two hundred families, Dutch and French, settled in the Levels.</s> <s sid="27" id="settlers.c1.s27">Some were collected into a village, and had a chapel opened, where a pastor of their own performed service for them.</s> <s sid="28" id="settlers.c1.s28">Others were scattered over the district, living just where their occupations required them to settle.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="settlers.c1.p6"><s sid="29" id="settlers.c1.s29">All these foreigners were subject to bad treatment from their neighbours; but the stragglers were the worst off; because it was easiest to tease and injure those who lived alone.</s> <s sid="30" id="settlers.c1.s30">The disappointed fishers and fowlers gave other reasons for their own conduct, besides that of being nearly deprived of their fishing and fowling.</s> <s sid="31" id="settlers.c1.s31">These reasons were all bad, as reasons for hating always are.</s> <s sid="32" id="settlers.c1.s32">One excuse was that the new settlers were foreigners--as if those who were far from their own land did not need particular hospitality and kindness.</s> <s sid="33" id="settlers.c1.s33">Another plea was that they were connected with the king, by being settled on the lands which he had bargained to have drained: so that all who sided with the parliament ought to injure the new tenants, in order to annoy the king.</s> <s sid="34" id="settlers.c1.s34">If the settlers had tried to serve the king by injuring his enemies, this last reason might have passed in a time of war.</s> <s sid="35" id="settlers.c1.s35">But it was not so.</s> <s sid="36" id="settlers.c1.s36">It is probable that the foreigners did not understand the quarrel.</s> <s sid="37" id="settlers.c1.s37">At any rate, they took no part in it.</s> <s sid="38" id="settlers.c1.s38">All they desired was to be left in peace, to cultivate the lands they paid rent for.</s> <s sid="39" id="settlers.c1.s39">But instead of peace, they had little but persecution.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="settlers.c1.p7"><s sid="40" id="settlers.c1.s40">One of these settlers, Mr Linacre, was not himself a farmer.</s> <s sid="41" id="settlers.c1.s41">He supplied the farmers of the district with a manure of a particular kind, which suited some of the richest soils they cultivated.</s> <s sid="42" id="settlers.c1.s42">He found, in the red soil of the isle, a large mass of that white earth, called gypsum, which, when wetted and burnt, makes plaster of Paris; and which, when ground, makes a fine manure for some soils, as the careful Dutchmen well knew.</s> <s sid="43" id="settlers.c1.s43">Mr Linacre set up a windmill on a little eminence which rose out of the Level, just high enough to catch the wind; and there he ground the gypsum which he dug from the neighbouring patch or quarry.</s> <s sid="44" id="settlers.c1.s44">He had to build some out-houses, but not a dwelling-house; for, near his mill, with just space enough for a good garden between, was one of the largest of the old cells of the monks of Saint Mary's, so well built of stone, and so comfortably arranged, that Mr Linacre had little to do but to have it cleaned and furnished, and the windows and doors made new, to fit it for the residence of his wife and children, and a servant.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="settlers.c1.p8"><s sid="45" id="settlers.c1.s45">This building was round, and had three rooms below, and three over them.</s> <s sid="46" id="settlers.c1.s46">A staircase of stone was in the very middle, winding round, like a corkscrew,--leading to the upper rooms, and out upon the roof, from which there was a beautiful view,--quite as far as the Humber to the north-east, and to the circle of hills on every other side.</s> <s sid="47" id="settlers.c1.s47">Each of the rooms below had a door to the open air, and another to the staircase;-- very unlike modern houses, and not so fit as they to keep out wind and cold.</s> <s sid="48" id="settlers.c1.s48">But for this, the dwelling would have been very warm, for the walls were of thick stone; and the fire-places were so large, that it seemed as if the monks had been fond of good fires.</s> <s sid="49" id="settlers.c1.s49">Two of these lower rooms opened into the garden; and the third, the kitchen, into the yard;--so that the maid, Ailwin, had not far to go to milk the cow and feed the poultry.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="settlers.c1.p9"><s sid="50" id="settlers.c1.s50">Mrs Linacre was as neat in the management of her house as people from Holland usually are; and she did not like that the sitting-room, where her husband had his meals, and spent his evenings, should be littered by the children, or used at all by them during her absence at her daily occupation, in the summer.</s> <s sid="51" id="settlers.c1.s51">So she let them use the third room for their employments and their play.</s> <s sid="52" id="settlers.c1.s52">Her occupation, every summer's day, was serving out the waters from a mineral spring, a good deal frequented by sick people, three miles from her house, on the way to Gainsborough.</s> <s sid="53" id="settlers.c1.s53">She set off, after an early breakfast, in the cool of the morning, and generally arrived at the hill-side where the spring was, and had unlocked her little shed, and taken out her glasses, and rinsed them, before any travellers passed.</s> <s sid="54" id="settlers.c1.s54">It was rarely indeed that a sick person had to wait a minute for her appearance.</s> <s sid="55" id="settlers.c1.s55">There she sat, in her shed when it rained, and under a tree when it was fine, sewing or knitting very diligently when no customers appeared, and now and then casting a glance over the Levels to the spot where her husband's mill rose in the midst of the green fields, and where she almost fancied sometimes that she could see the children sitting on the mill-steps, or working in the garden.</s> <s sid="56" id="settlers.c1.s56">When customers appeared, she was always ready in a moment to serve them; and her smile cheered those who were sick, and pleased those who came merely from curiosity.</s> <s sid="57" id="settlers.c1.s57">She slipped the halfpence she received into a pocket beneath her apron; and sometimes the pocket was such a heavy one to carry three miles home, that she just stepped aside to the village shop at Haxey, or into a farm-house where the people would be going to market next day, to get her copper exchanged for silver.</s> <s sid="58" id="settlers.c1.s58">Since the times had become so troubled as they were now, however, she had avoided showing her money anywhere on the road.</s> <s sid="59" id="settlers.c1.s59">Her husband's advice was that she should give up attending the spring altogether; but she gained so much money by it, and it was so likely that somebody would step into her place there as soon as she gave it up, so that she would not be able to regain her office when quieter times should come, that she entreated him to allow her to go on while she had no fears.</s> <s sid="60" id="settlers.c1.s60">She took the heavy gold ear-rings out of her ears, wore a plainer cap, and left her large silver watch at home; so that she looked like a poor woman whom no needy soldier or bold thief would think of robbing.</s> <s sid="61" id="settlers.c1.s61">She guessed by the sun what was the right time for locking up her glasses and going home; and she commonly met her husband, coming to fetch her, before she had got half-way.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="settlers.c1.p10"><s sid="62" id="settlers.c1.s62">The three children were sure to be perched on the top of the quarry bank, or on the mill-steps, or out on the roof of the house, at the top of the winding staircase.</s> <s sid="63" id="settlers.c1.s63">Little George himself, though only two years old, knew the very moment when he should shout and clap his hands, to make his mother wave her handkerchief from the turn of the road.</s> <s sid="64" id="settlers.c1.s64">Oliver and Mildred did not exactly feel that the days were too long while their mother was away, for they had plenty to do; but they felt that the best part of the day was the hour between her return and their going to bed: and, unlike people generally, they liked winter better than summer, because at that season their mother never left them, except to go to the shop, or the market at Haxey.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="settlers.c1.p11"><s sid="65" id="settlers.c1.s65">Though Oliver was only eleven, and Mildred nine, they were not too young to have a great deal to do.</s> <s sid="66" id="settlers.c1.s66">Oliver was really useful as a gardener; and many a good dish of vegetables of his growing came to table in the course of the year.</s> <s sid="67" id="settlers.c1.s67">Mildred had to take care of the child almost all day; she often prepared the cabbage, and cut the bacon for Ailwin to broil.</s> <s sid="68" id="settlers.c1.s68">She could also do what Ailwin could not,--she could sew a little; and now and then there was an apron or a handkerchief ready to be shown when Mrs Linacre came home in the evening.</s> <s sid="69" id="settlers.c1.s69">If she met with any difficulty in her job, the maid could not help her, but her father sometimes could; and it was curious to see Mildred mounting the mill when she was at any loss, and her father wiping the white plaster off his hands, and taking the needle or the scissors in his great fingers, rather than that his little girl should not be able to surprise her mother with a finished piece of work.</s> <s sid="70" id="settlers.c1.s70">Then, both Oliver and Mildred had to learn their catechism, to say to Pastor Dendel on Sunday; and always a copy or an exercise on hand, to be ready to show him when he should call; and some book to finish that he had lent them to read, and that others of his flock would be ready for when they had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="settlers.c1.p12"><s sid="71" id="settlers.c1.s71">Besides all this, there was an occupation which both boy and girl thought more of than of all others together.</s> <s sid="72" id="settlers.c1.s72">Among the loads of gypsum that came to the mill, there were often pieces of the best kind,--lumps of real, fine alabaster.</s> <s sid="73" id="settlers.c1.s73">Alabaster is so soft as to be easily worked.</s> <s sid="74" id="settlers.c1.s74">Even a finger-nail will make a mark upon it.</s> <s sid="75" id="settlers.c1.s75">Everybody knows how beautiful vases and little statues, well wrought in alabaster, look on a mantelpiece, or a drawing-room table.</s> <s sid="76" id="settlers.c1.s76">Oliver had seen such in France, where they are very common: and his father had carried one or two ornaments of this kind into Holland, when he had to leave France.</s> <s sid="77" id="settlers.c1.s77">It was a great delight for Oliver to find, on settling in Axholme, that he could have as much alabaster as he pleased, if he could only work it.</s> <s sid="78" id="settlers.c1.s78">With a little help from Pastor Dendel and his father, he soon learned to do so; and of all his employments, he liked this the best.</s> <s sid="79" id="settlers.c1.s79">Pastor Dendel brought him a few bowls and cups of pretty shapes and different sizes, made of common wood by a turner, who was one of his flock; and Oliver first copied these in clay, and then in alabaster.</s> <s sid="80" id="settlers.c1.s80">By degrees he learned to vary his patterns, and at last to make his clay models from fancies of his own,--some turning out failures, and others prettier than any of his wooden cups.</s> <s sid="81" id="settlers.c1.s81">These last he proceeded to carve out of alabaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="settlers.c1.p13"><s sid="82" id="settlers.c1.s82">Mildred could not help watching him while he was about his favourite work, though it was difficult to keep little George from tossing the alabaster about, and stamping on the best pieces, or sucking them.</s> <s sid="83" id="settlers.c1.s83">He would sometimes give his sister a few minutes' peace and quiet by rolling the wooden bowls the whole length of the room, and running after them: and there was also an hour, in the middle of the day, when he went to sleep in his large Dutch cradle.</s> <s sid="84" id="settlers.c1.s84">At those times Mildred would consult with her brother about his work; or sew or watch him by turns; or read one of the pastor's little books, stopping occasionally to wonder whether Oliver could attend at once to his carving, and to what she was reading.</s> <s sid="85" id="settlers.c1.s85">When she saw that he was spoiling any part, or that his hand was shaking, she would ask whether he had not been at work long enough; and then they would run out to the garden or the quarry, or to jump George (if he was awake again) from the second mill-step.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="settlers.c1.p14"><s sid="86" id="settlers.c1.s86">One fine month of August, not a breath of wind had been blowing for a week or two, so that the mill-sails had not made a single turn; not a load of gypsum had been brought during the time, and Oliver was quite out of alabaster; though, as it happened, he much wanted a good supply, for a particular reason.</s> <s sid="87" id="settlers.c1.s87">Every morning he brought out his tools; and every morning the sky was so clear, the corn-fields so still--the very trees so silent, that he wondered whether there had ever been so calm a month of August before.</s> <s sid="88" id="settlers.c1.s88">His father and he employed their time upon the garden, while they had so good an opportunity.</s> <s sid="89" id="settlers.c1.s89">Before it was all put in order, and the entire stock of autumn cabbages set, there came a breezy day; and the children were left to finish the cabbage patch by themselves.</s> <s sid="90" id="settlers.c1.s90">While they were at work, it made them merry to hear the mill-sails whirring through the air, and to see, at intervals, the trees above the quarry bowing their heads, and the reeds waving in the swamp, and the water of the meadow-ponds dimpling and rippling, as the wind swept over the Levels.</s> <s sid="91" id="settlers.c1.s91">Oliver soon heard something that he liked better still--the creak of the truck that brought the gypsum from the quarry, and the crack of the driver's whip.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="settlers.c1.p15"><s sid="92" id="settlers.c1.s92">He threw down the dibble with which he was planting out his cabbages-- tripped over the line he had set to direct his drilling, tumbled on his face, scrambled up again, and ran, rubbing the dirt from his knees as he went, to look out some alabaster from the load.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="settlers.c1.p16"><s sid="93" id="settlers.c1.s93">Mildred was not long after him, though he called to her that she had better stay and finish the cabbages, and though little George, immediately on feeling himself at liberty, threw himself upon the fresh mould of the cabbage bed, and amused himself with pulling up, and flinging right and left, the plants that had just been set.</s> <s sid="94" id="settlers.c1.s94">How could Mildred attend to this, when she was sure she was wanted to turn over the gypsum, and see what she could find?</s> <s sid="95" id="settlers.c1.s95">So Master George went on with his pranks, till Ailwin, by accident, saw him from the yard, ran and snatched him up, flung him over her shoulder, and carried him away screaming, till, to pacify him, she set him down among the poultry, which he presently found more amusing than young cabbage plants.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="settlers.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="settlers.c1.s96"><qs/>"Now we shall have a set of new cups for the spring, presently,"<qe/> said Oliver, as he measured lump after lump with his little foot-rule.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="settlers.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="settlers.c1.s97"><qs/>"Cups for the waters!"<qe/> exclaimed his father.</s> <s sid="98" id="settlers.c1.s98"><qs/>"So that is the reason of this prodigious hurry, is it, my boy?</s> <s sid="99" id="settlers.c1.s99">You think tin cups not good enough for your mother, or for her customers, or for the waters.</s> <s sid="100" id="settlers.c1.s100">Which of them do you think ought to be ashamed of tin cups?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="settlers.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="settlers.c1.s101"><qs/>"The water, most of all.</s> <s sid="102" id="settlers.c1.s102">Instead of sparkling in a clear bright glass, it looks as nasty as it tastes in a thing that is more brown and rusty every time it is dipped.</s> <s sid="103" id="settlers.c1.s103">I will give the folk a pair of cups that shall tempt them to drink--a pair of cups as white as milk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="settlers.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="settlers.c1.s104"><qs/>"They will not long remain white: and those who broke the glasses will be the more bent upon spoiling your cups, the more pains you spend upon them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="settlers.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="settlers.c1.s105"><qs/>"I hope the Redfurns will not happen to hear of them.</s> <s sid="106" id="settlers.c1.s106">We need not blab; and the folk who drink the waters go their way, as soon as they have done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="settlers.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="settlers.c1.s107"><qs/>"Whether the Redfurns be here or there, my boy, there is no want of prying eyes to see all that the poor foreigners do.</s> <s sid="108" id="settlers.c1.s108">Your mother is watched, it is my belief, every time she dips her cup; and I in the mill, and you in the garden.</s> <s sid="109" id="settlers.c1.s109">There is no hope of keeping anything from our enemies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="settlers.c1.p23"><s sid="110" id="settlers.c1.s110">Seeing Oliver look about him uneasily, Mr Linacre reproached himself for having said anything to alarm his timid boy: so he added what he himself always found the most comforting thought, when he felt disturbed at living among unkind neighbours.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="settlers.c5.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="settlers.c5.s8">The first disturbance was from the child.</s> <s sid="9" id="settlers.c5.s9">Oliver became aware, through his sleep, that little George was moving about and laughing.</s> <s sid="10" id="settlers.c5.s10">Oliver murmured, <qs/>"Be quiet, George.</s> <s sid="11" id="settlers.c5.s11">Lie still, dear,"<qe/> and the child was quiet for a minute.</s> <s sid="12" id="settlers.c5.s12">Presently, however, he moved again, and something like a dabbling in water was heard, while, at the same moment, Oliver found his feet cold.</s> <s sid="13" id="settlers.c5.s13">He roused himself with a start, felt that his bed was wet, and turning out, was up to the ankles in water.</s> <s sid="14" id="settlers.c5.s14">By the light of the embers, he saw that the floor was a pond, with some shoes floating on it.</s> <s sid="15" id="settlers.c5.s15">His call woke Ailwin and Mildred at once.</s> <s sid="16" id="settlers.c5.s16">Roger did not stir, though there was a good deal of bustle and noise.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="settlers.c5.p3"><s sid="17" id="settlers.c5.s17">Mildred's bed was so high above the floor as to be still quite dry.</s> <s sid="18" id="settlers.c5.s18">Oliver told her to stay there till he should settle what was to be done next: and he took up the child to put him with Mildred, asking her to strip off his drenched clothes, and keep him warm.</s> <s sid="19" id="settlers.c5.s19">All the apparel that had been taken off was luckily on the top of a chest, far above the water.</s> <s sid="20" id="settlers.c5.s20">Oliver handed this to his sister, bidding her dress herself, as well as the child.</s> <s sid="21" id="settlers.c5.s21">He then carefully put the fire together, to make as much light as possible, and then told Ailwin that they must bestir themselves, as the fire would presently be drowned out.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="settlers.c5.p4"><s sid="22" id="settlers.c5.s22">Ailwin was quite ready to bestir herself; but she had no idea beyond mounting on chests, chairs, and drawers; unless, indeed, she thought of the beam which crossed the ceiling, to which she was seen to cast her eyes, as if envying the chicks which hung there, or the hen which still slept, with her head beneath her wing, out of present reach of the flood.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="settlers.c5.p5"><s sid="23" id="settlers.c5.s23">Oliver disapproved of the plan of mounting on the furniture of the room.</s> <s sid="24" id="settlers.c5.s24">It might be all very well, he said, if there were nothing better to be done.</s> <s sid="25" id="settlers.c5.s25">But, by the time the water would reach the top of the chests, it would be impossible to get out by the door.</s> <s sid="26" id="settlers.c5.s26">He thought it would be wisest to reach the roof of the house while they could, and to carry with them all the comforts they could collect, while they might be removed in a dry condition.</s> <s sid="27" id="settlers.c5.s27">Ailwin agreed, and was going to throw open the door, when Oliver stopped her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="settlers.c5.p6" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="settlers.c5.s28"><qs/>"Why, Oliver,"<qe/><sss/> she cried, <sse/><qs/>"you won't let one do anything; and you say, all the time, that there is not a minute to be lost."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="settlers.c5.p7"><s sid="29" id="settlers.c5.s29">Oliver showed her that water was streaming in at the sides of the door, a good way higher up than it stood on the floor.</s> <s sid="30" id="settlers.c5.s30">He said that the door was a defence at present,--that the water was higher on the stairs than in the room, and that there would be a great rush as soon as the door should be opened.</s> <s sid="31" id="settlers.c5.s31">He wished, therefore, that the bedding, and the clothes from the drawers, and all else that they could remove to the top of the house, should be bundled up, and placed on the highest chest of drawers, before the water should be let in.</s> <s sid="32" id="settlers.c5.s32">They must borrow the line from the clothes' basket, to tie round George's waist, that they might not lose him in the confusion.</s> <s sid="33" id="settlers.c5.s33">One other thing must be done: they must rouse Roger, or he might be drowned.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="settlers.c5.p8"><s sid="34" id="settlers.c5.s34">Ailwin was anxious that this last piece of duty should be omitted:--not that she exactly wished that Roger should be drowned,--at least, not through her means; but she, ignorant as she was,--had a superstitious feeling that Roger and his family had caused this flood, and that he could save himself well enough, though he appeared to be sunk in a drunken sleep.</s> <s sid="35" id="settlers.c5.s35">She indulged Oliver, however, so far as to help him to seize the lad, neck and heels, and lay him, dripping as he was, upon the table.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="settlers.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="settlers.c5.s36">Before the bedding and clothes were all tied up, the door of the room shook so as to threaten to burst in, from the latch giving way.</s> <s sid="37" id="settlers.c5.s37">It struck everybody that the person who should open it would run the risk of being suffocated, or terribly knocked about; and yet, it was hardly wise to wait for its bursting.</s> <s sid="38" id="settlers.c5.s38">Oliver, therefore, tied a string to the knob of the bolt, then slipped the bolt, to keep the door fastened while he lifted and tied up the latch.</s> <s sid="39" id="settlers.c5.s39">The door shook more and more; so, having set the window wide open, he made haste to scramble up to where Mildred was, wound the cord which was about George's waist round his own arm, bade Mildred hold the child fast, and gave notice that he was going to open the door.</s> <s sid="40" id="settlers.c5.s40">It was a strange party, as the boy could not help noting at the moment,--the maid standing on the bed, hugging the bed-post, and staring with frightened eyes; Roger snoring on the table, just under the sleeping hen on the beam; and the three children perched on the top of a high chest of drawers.</s> <s sid="41" id="settlers.c5.s41">George took it all for play,-- the new sash he had on and the bolting the door, and the climbing and scrambling.</s> <s sid="42" id="settlers.c5.s42">He laughed and kicked, so that his sister could scarcely hold him.</s> <s sid="43" id="settlers.c5.s43"><qs/>"Now for it!"<qe/> cried Oliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="settlers.c5.p10" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="settlers.c5.s44"><qs/>"Oh, Oliver, stop a minute!"<qe/> cried Ailwin.</s> <s sid="45" id="settlers.c5.s45"><qs/>"Don't be in such a hurry to drown us all, Oliver.</s> <s sid="46" id="settlers.c5.s46">Stop a moment, Oliver."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="settlers.c5.p11"><s sid="47" id="settlers.c5.s47">Oliver knew, however, that the way to drown them all was to stop.</s> <s sid="48" id="settlers.c5.s48">At the first pull the bolt gave way, the door burst open, as if it would break from its hinges, and a great body of water dashed in.</s> <s sid="49" id="settlers.c5.s49">The first thing the wave did was to wash Roger off the table; the next, to put out the fire with a fizz,--so that there was no other light but the dawn, now advancing.</s> <s sid="50" id="settlers.c5.s50">The waters next dashed up against the wall opposite the door; and then by the rebound, with less force, against the drawers on which the children sat.</s> <s sid="51" id="settlers.c5.s51">It then leaped out of the window, leaving a troubled surface at about half the height of the room.</s> <s sid="52" id="settlers.c5.s52">Above the noise, Ailwin was heard lamenting, the chicks cluttering, the hen fluttering, and George laughing and clapping his hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="settlers.c5.p12" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="settlers.c5.s53"><qs/>"You have George safe?"<qe/> said Oliver.</s> <s sid="54" id="settlers.c5.s54"><qs/>"Very well!</s> <s sid="55" id="settlers.c5.s55">I believe we can all get out.</s> <s sid="56" id="settlers.c5.s56">There is Roger's head above water; and I don't think it is more than up to my neck; though everybody laughs at me for being a short boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="settlers.c5.p13"><s sid="57" id="settlers.c5.s57">He stepped down upon a chair, and then cautiously into the water.</s> <s sid="58" id="settlers.c5.s58">It was very nearly up to his chin.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="settlers.c5.p14" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="settlers.c5.s59"><qs/>"That will do,"<qe/> said he, cheerfully.</s> <s sid="60" id="settlers.c5.s60"><qs/>"Now, Ailwin, you are the tallest;--please carry George out on the roof of the house, and stay there with him till I come."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="settlers.c5.p15"><s sid="61" id="settlers.c5.s61">Ailwin made many lamentations at having to step down into the water; but she took good care of the child, carrying him quite high and dry.</s> <s sid="62" id="settlers.c5.s62">Oliver followed, to see that he was tied securely to the balustrade on the roof.</s> <s sid="63" id="settlers.c5.s63">While he was doing this, Ailwin brought Mildred in the same way.</s> <s sid="64" id="settlers.c5.s64">Mildred wanted to be of use below; but her brother told her the best thing she could do was to watch and amuse George, and to stand ready to receive the things saved from the chambers,--she not being tall enough to do any service in four feet of water.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="settlers.c5.p16" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="settlers.c5.s65">It was a strange forlorn feeling to Mildred,--the being left on the house-top in the cold grey morning, at an hour when she had always hitherto been asleep in bed.</s> <s sid="66" id="settlers.c5.s66">The world itself, as she looked round her, seemed unlike the one she had hitherto lived in.</s> <s sid="67" id="settlers.c5.s67">The stars were in the sky; but they were dim,--fading before the light of morning.</s> <s sid="68" id="settlers.c5.s68">There were no fields, no gardens, no roads to be seen;--only grey water, far away on every side.</s> <s sid="69" id="settlers.c5.s69">She could see nothing beyond this grey water, except towards the east, where a line of low hills stood between her and the brightening sky.</s> <s sid="70" id="settlers.c5.s70">Poor Mildred felt dizzy, with so much moving water before her eyes, and in her ears the sound of the current below.</s> <s sid="71" id="settlers.c5.s71">The house shook and trembled, too, under the force of the flood: so that she was glad to fix her sight on the steady line of the distant hills.</s> <s sid="72" id="settlers.c5.s72">She spoke to George occasionally, to keep him quiet; and she was ready to receive every article that was handed up the stairs from below: but, in all the intervals, she fixed her eyes on the distant hills.</s> <s sid="73" id="settlers.c5.s73">She thought how easy it would be to reach that ridge, if she were a bird; and how hard it would be to pine away on this house-top, or to sink to death in these waters, for want of the wings which inferior creatures had.</s> <s sid="74" id="settlers.c5.s74">Then she thought of superior creatures that had wings too: and she longed to be an angel.</s> <s sid="75" id="settlers.c5.s75">She longed to be out of all this trouble and fear; and considered that it would be worth while to be drowned, to be as free as a bird or an angel.</s> <s sid="76" id="settlers.c5.s76">She resolved to remember this, and not to be frightened, if the water should rise and rise, till it should sweep her quite away.</s> <s sid="77" id="settlers.c5.s77">She thought that this might have befallen her mother yesterday.</s> <s sid="78" id="settlers.c5.s78">No boat had been seen on the waters in the direction of Gainsborough; no sign had reached the family that any one was thinking of them at a distance, and trying to save them: and Oliver and Mildred had agreed that it was likely that Mrs Linacre had heard some report of the pulling up of the sluices, and might have been on her way home when the flood overtook and drowned her.</s> <s sid="79" id="settlers.c5.s79">If so, she might be now an angel.</s> <s sid="80" id="settlers.c5.s80">If an angel, Mildred was sure her first thought would be, as it had ever been, of her home and her children; and the little girl looked up to see whether there was anything like the shadow of wings between her and the dim stars.</s> <s sid="81" id="settlers.c5.s81">She saw nothing; but still, in some kind of hope, she softly breathed the words, <qs/>"O, mother!</s> <s sid="82" id="settlers.c5.s82">Mother!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="settlers.c5.p17" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="settlers.c5.s83"><qs/>"Mother!</s> <s sid="84" id="settlers.c5.s84">Mother!"<qe/> shouted little George, as he overheard her.</s> <s sid="85" id="settlers.c5.s85">Oliver leaped up the stairs, and inquired whether there was a boat,--whether mother was coming.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="settlers.c5.p18" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="settlers.c5.s86"><qs/>"No, Oliver, no.</s> <s sid="87" id="settlers.c5.s87">I was only thinking about mother; and so, I suppose, was George.</s> <s sid="88" id="settlers.c5.s88">I am afraid you are disappointed;--I am sorry."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="settlers.c5.p19"><s sid="89" id="settlers.c5.s89">Oliver bit his lip to prevent crying, and could not speak directly; but seemed to be gazing carefully all around the waste.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="settlers.c5.p20" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="settlers.c5.s90"><qs/>"Unless she should be an angel now,"<qe/><sss/> whispered Mildred,--<sse/><qs/>"unless she died yesterday; and then she might be with us now, at this very moment, though we cannot see her;--might not she?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="settlers.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="settlers.c5.s91"><qs/>"Yes, I believe so, dear.</s> <s sid="92" id="settlers.c5.s92">And, for one thing, I almost wish she may not come in a boat.</s> <s sid="93" id="settlers.c5.s93">Who should tell her that father was carried away into all those waters, without having spoken one word to us?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="settlers.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="settlers.c5.s94"><qs/>"If they are both dead, do you not think they are together now?"<qe/> asked Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="settlers.c5.p23" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="settlers.c5.s95"><qs/>"Certainly.</s> <s sid="96" id="settlers.c5.s96">Pastor Dendel says that all who love one another well enough will live together, where they will never die any more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="settlers.c5.p24" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="settlers.c5.s97"><qs/>"And I am sure they did,"<qe/> said Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="settlers.c5.p25" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="settlers.c5.s98"><qs/>"If they see us now,"<qe/><sss/> said Oliver, <sse/><qs/>"it must make a great difference to them whether we are frightened and miserable, or whether we behave as we ought to do.</s> <s sid="99" id="settlers.c5.s99">Let us try not to be frightened, for their sakes, dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="settlers.c5.p26" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="settlers.c5.s100"><qs/>"And if they are not with us all the while, God is,"<qe/> whispered Mildred.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="settlers.c5.p28" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="settlers.c5.s102"><qs/>"Surely He will feel in some way as they do about us,"<qe/> said Mildred, remembering and repeating the verse Pastor Dendel had taught her.</s> <s sid="103" id="settlers.c5.s103"><qs/>"`Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="settlers.c5.p29" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="settlers.c5.s104"><qs/>"`For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.'"<qe/></s> <s sid="105" id="settlers.c5.s105">So Oliver continued the psalm.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="settlers.c5.p30" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="settlers.c5.s106"><qs/>"There comes the sun!"<qe/> exclaimed Mildred, happy to greet some one familiar object amidst this strange scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="settlers.c5.p31"><s sid="107" id="settlers.c5.s107">The scene hardly appeared the same when the sun, after first peeping above the hills like a golden star, flamed up to its full size, and cast a broad glittering light over the wide waters, and into the very eyes of the children.</s> <s sid="108" id="settlers.c5.s108">They felt the warmth too, immediately; and it was very cheering.</s> <s sid="109" id="settlers.c5.s109">The eastern hills now almost disappeared in the sun's blaze; and those to the west shone very clearly; and the southern ridge near Gainsborough, looked really but a little way off.</s> <s sid="110" id="settlers.c5.s110">The children knew, however, that there were three full miles between them and any land, except their Red-hill, and a few hillocks which peeped above the flood in the Levels: and there was no sign of a boat, far or near.</s> <s sid="111" id="settlers.c5.s111">Oliver checked a sigh, when he had convinced himself of this; and began to look what had become of the people they knew in the Levels.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="settlers.c5.p32"><s sid="112" id="settlers.c5.s112">Neighbour Gool's dwelling stood low; and nothing was now to be seen of it but a dark speck, which might be the top of a chimney.</s> <s sid="113" id="settlers.c5.s113">It was possible that the whole family might have escaped; for Gool and his wife were to be at Haxey yesterday; and they might there hear of the mischief intended or done to the sluices, in time to save the rest of the household.</s> <s sid="114" id="settlers.c5.s114">Some of the roofs of the hamlet of Sandtoft stood above the waters; and the whole upper part of the chapel used by the foreigners; and many might easily have found a refuge there.</s> <s sid="115" id="settlers.c5.s115">Further off, a conspicuous object was the elegant crocketed spire of one of the beautiful Lincolnshire churches, standing high, as if inviting those who were dismayed to come and save themselves in the air from the dangers of the waters.</s> <s sid="116" id="settlers.c5.s116">Oliver wondered whether any sufferers were now watching the sunrise from the long ridge of the church-roof, or from the windows of the spire.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="settlers.c5.p33"><s sid="117" id="settlers.c5.s117">One of the most curious sights was the fleets of haystacks that were sailing along in the courses of the currents.</s> <s sid="118" id="settlers.c5.s118">As the smaller stacks were sometimes shot forward rapidly, and whirled round by an eddy, while a large stately stack followed forwards, performing the same turns of the voyage, Mildred compared them to a duck and her ducklings in the pond, and Oliver to a great ship voyaging with a fleet of small craft.</s> <s sid="119" id="settlers.c5.s119">They saw sights far more sorrowful than this.</s> <s sid="120" id="settlers.c5.s120">They grieved over the fine large trees--some in full leaf--that they saw tumbling about in the torrents which cut through the stiller waters; but it was yet worse to see dead cows, horses, pigs, and sheep carried past--some directly through the garden, or over the spot where the mill had stood.</s> <s sid="121" id="settlers.c5.s121">There were also thatched roofs carried away entire; and many a chest, chair, and cow-rack--showing the destruction that had gone on during the night.</s> <s sid="122" id="settlers.c5.s122">While the distant scene was all bright and lovely in the sunrise, these nearer objects, thickly strewn in the muddy waters, were ugly and dismal; and Oliver saw that it did him and his sister no good to watch them.</s> <s sid="123" id="settlers.c5.s123">He started, and said they must not be idle any longer.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="settlers.c5.p34"><s sid="124" id="settlers.c5.s124">Just then Ailwin called from the stairs,--</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="settlers.c6.p7"><s sid="38" id="settlers.c6.s38">Roger started bolt upright, and looked about him.</s> <s sid="39" id="settlers.c6.s39">He felt very tired; but he thought he would not lie down again just yet.</s> <s sid="40" id="settlers.c6.s40">It was odd that he could not get sound asleep, so tired as he was.</s> <s sid="41" id="settlers.c6.s41">If he should not sleep better than this at night, what should he do?</s> <s sid="42" id="settlers.c6.s42">He wished he had some more of that woman's cherry-brandy.</s> <s sid="43" id="settlers.c6.s43">He had slept sound enough after drinking that.</s> <s sid="44" id="settlers.c6.s44">It was well for Roger that he was not now within reach of intoxicating liquors--the state of his mind would probably have made a drunkard of him.</s> </p>
