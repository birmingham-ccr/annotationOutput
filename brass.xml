<title>CHAPTER I. HORACE VENTIMORE RECEIVES A COMMISSION</title>
<p pid="1" id="brass.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="brass.c1.s1"><qs/>"This day six weeks--just six weeks ago!"<qe/></s> <s sid="2" id="brass.c1.s2">Horace Ventimore said, half aloud, to himself, and pulled out his watch.</s> <s sid="3" id="brass.c1.s3"><qs/>"Half-past twelve--what was I doing at half-past twelve?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="brass.c1.s4">As he sat at the window of his office in Great Cloister Street, Westminster, he made his thoughts travel back to a certain glorious morning in August which now seemed so remote and irrecoverable.</s> <s sid="5" id="brass.c1.s5">At this precise time he was waiting on the balcony of the Hotel de la Plage--the sole hostelry of St.</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c1.s6">Luc-en-Port, the tiny Normandy watering-place upon which, by some happy inspiration, he had lighted during a solitary cycling tour--waiting until She should appear.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="brass.c1.s7">He could see the whole scene: the tiny cove, with the violet shadow of the cliff sleeping on the green water; the swell of the waves lazily lapping against the diving-board from which he had plunged half an hour before; he remembered the long swim out to the buoy; the exhilarated anticipation with which he had dressed and climbed the steep path to the hotel terrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="brass.c1.s8">For was he not to pass the whole remainder of that blissful day in Sylvia Futvoye's society?</s> <s sid="9" id="brass.c1.s9">Were they not to cycle together (there were, of course, others of the party--but they did not count), to cycle over to Veulettes, to picnic there under the cliff, and ride back--always together--in the sweet-scented dusk, over the slopes, between the poplars or the cornfields glowing golden against a sky of warm purple?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c1.p5"><s sid="10" id="brass.c1.s10">Now he saw himself going round to the gravelled courtyard in front of the hotel with a sudden dread of missing her.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c1.s11">There was nothing there but the little low cart, with its canvas tilt which was to convey Professor Futvoye and his wife to the place of _rendezvous_.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c1.p6"><s sid="12" id="brass.c1.s12">There was Sylvia at last, distractingly fair and fresh in her cool pink blouse and cream-coloured skirt; how gracious and friendly and generally delightful she had been throughout that unforgettable day, which was supreme amongst others only a little less perfect, and all now fled for ever!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c1.p7"><s sid="13" id="brass.c1.s13">They had had drawbacks, it was true.</s> <s sid="14" id="brass.c1.s14">Old Futvoye was perhaps the least bit of a bore at times, with his interminable disquisitions on Egyptian art and ancient Oriental character-writing, in which he seemed convinced that Horace must feel a perfervid interest, as, indeed, he thought it politic to affect.</s> <s sid="15" id="brass.c1.s15">The Professor was a most learned archaeologist, and positively bulged with information on his favourite subjects; but it is just possible that Horace might have been less curious concerning the distinction between Cuneiform and Aramaean or Kufic and Arabic inscriptions if his informant had happened to be the father of anybody else.</s> <s sid="16" id="brass.c1.s16">However, such insincerities as these are but so many evidences of sincerity.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="brass.c1.p8"><s sid="17" id="brass.c1.s17">So with self-tormenting ingenuity Horace conjured up various pictures from that Norman holiday of his: the little half-timbered cottages with their faded blue shutters and the rushes growing out of their thatch roofs; the spires of village churches gleaming above the bronze-green beeches; the bold headlands, their ochre and yellow cliffs contrasting grimly with the soft ridges of the turf above them; the tethered black-and-white cattle grazing peacefully against a background of lapis lazuli and malachite sea, and in every scene the sensation of Sylvia's near presence, the sound of her voice in his ears.</s> <s sid="18" id="brass.c1.s18">And now?... He looked up from the papers and tracing-cloth on his desk, and round the small panelled room which served him as an office, at the framed plans and photographs, the set squares and T squares on the walls, and felt a dull resentment against his surroundings.</s> <s sid="19" id="brass.c1.s19">From his window he commanded a cheerful view of a tall, mouldering wall, once part of the Abbey boundaries, surmounted by _chevaux-de-frise_, above whose rust-attenuated spikes some plane trees stretched their yellowing branches.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="brass.c1.s20"><qs/>"She would have come to care for me,"<qe/> Horace's thoughts ran on, disjointedly.</s> <s sid="21" id="brass.c1.s21"><qs/>"I could have sworn that that last day of all--and her people didn't seem to object to me.</s> <s sid="22" id="brass.c1.s22">Her mother asked me cordially enough to call on them when they were back in town.</s> <s sid="23" id="brass.c1.s23">When I did----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="brass.c1.p10"><s sid="24" id="brass.c1.s24">When he had called, there had been a difference--not an unusual sequel to an acquaintanceship begun in a Continental watering-place.</s> <s sid="25" id="brass.c1.s25">It was difficult to define, but unmistakable--a certain formality and constraint on Mrs. Futvoye's part, and even on Sylvia's, which seemed intended to warn him that it is not every friendship that survives the Channel passage.</s> <s sid="26" id="brass.c1.s26">So he had gone away sore at heart, but fully recognising that any advances in future must come from their side.</s> <s sid="27" id="brass.c1.s27">They might ask him to dinner, or at least to call again; but more than a month had passed, and they had made no sign.</s> <s sid="28" id="brass.c1.s28">No, it was all over; he must consider himself dropped.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="brass.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="brass.c1.s29"><qs/>"After all,"<qe/><sls/> he told himself, with a short and anything but mirthful laugh, <sle/><qs/>"it's natural enough.</s> <s sid="30" id="brass.c1.s30">Mrs. Futvoye has probably been making inquiries about my professional prospects.</s> <s sid="31" id="brass.c1.s31">It's better as it is.</s> <s sid="32" id="brass.c1.s32">What earthly chance have I got of marrying unless I can get work of my own?</s> <s sid="33" id="brass.c1.s33">It's all I can do to keep myself decently.</s> <s sid="34" id="brass.c1.s34">I've no right to dream of asking any one--to say nothing of Sylvia--to marry me.</s> <s sid="35" id="brass.c1.s35">I should only be rushing into temptation if I saw any more of her.</s> <s sid="36" id="brass.c1.s36">She's not for a poor beggar like me, who was born unlucky.</s> <s sid="37" id="brass.c1.s37">Well, whining won't do any good--let's have a look at Beevor's latest performance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="brass.c1.s38">He spread out a large coloured plan, in a corner of which appeared the name of <qs/>"William Beevor, Architect,"<qe/> and began to study it in a spirit of anything but appreciation.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="brass.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="brass.c1.s39"><qs/>"Beevor gets on,"<qe/> he said to himself.</s> <s sid="40" id="brass.c1.s40"><qs/>"Heaven knows that I don't grudge him his success.</s> <s sid="41" id="brass.c1.s41">He's a good fellow--though he _does_ build architectural atrocities, and seem to like 'em.</s> <s sid="42" id="brass.c1.s42">Who am I to give myself airs?</s> <s sid="43" id="brass.c1.s43">He's successful--I'm not.</s> <s sid="44" id="brass.c1.s44">Yet if I only had his opportunities, what wouldn't I make of them!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="brass.c1.p14"><s sid="45" id="brass.c1.s45">Let it be said here that this was not the ordinary self-delusion of an incompetent.</s> <s sid="46" id="brass.c1.s46">Ventimore really had talent above the average, with ideals and ambitions which might under better conditions have attained recognition and fulfilment before this.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="brass.c1.p15"><s sid="47" id="brass.c1.s47">But he was not quite energetic enough, besides being too proud, to push himself into notice, and hitherto he had met with persistent ill-luck.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="brass.c1.p16"><s sid="48" id="brass.c1.s48">So Horace had no other occupation now but to give Beevor, whose offices and clerk he shared, such slight assistance as he might require, and it was by no means cheering to feel that every year of this enforced semi-idleness left him further handicapped in the race for wealth and fame, for he had already passed his twenty-eighth birthday.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="brass.c1.p17"><s sid="49" id="brass.c1.s49">If Miss Sylvia Futvoye had indeed felt attracted towards him at one time it was not altogether incomprehensible.</s> <s sid="50" id="brass.c1.s50">Horace Ventimore was not a model of manly beauty--models of manly beauty are rare out of novels, and seldom interesting in them; but his clear-cut, clean-shaven face possessed a certain distinction, and if there were faint satirical lines about the mouth, they were redeemed by the expression of the grey-blue eyes, which were remarkably frank and pleasant.</s> <s sid="51" id="brass.c1.s51">He was well made, and tall enough to escape all danger of being described as short; fair-haired and pale, without being unhealthily pallid, in complexion, and he gave the impression of being a man who took life as it came, and whose sense of humour would serve as a lining for most clouds that might darken his horizon.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="brass.c1.p18"><s sid="52" id="brass.c1.s52">There was a rap at the door which communicated with Beevor's office, and Beevor himself, a florid, thick-set man, with small side-whiskers, burst in.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="brass.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="brass.c1.s53"><qs/>"I say, Ventimore, you didn't run off with the plans for that house I'm building at Larchmere, did you?</s> <s sid="54" id="brass.c1.s54">Because--ah, I see you're looking over them.</s> <s sid="55" id="brass.c1.s55">Sorry to deprive you, but----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="brass.c1.s56"><qs/>"Thanks, old fellow, take them, by all means.</s> <s sid="57" id="brass.c1.s57">I've seen all I wanted to see."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="brass.c1.s58"><qs/>"Well, I'm just off to Larchmere now.</s> <s sid="59" id="brass.c1.s59">Want to be there to check the quantities, and there's my other house at Fittlesdon.</s> <s sid="60" id="brass.c1.s60">I must go on afterwards and set it out, so I shall probably be away some days.</s> <s sid="61" id="brass.c1.s61">I'm taking Harrison down, too.</s> <s sid="62" id="brass.c1.s62">You won't be wanting him, eh?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="brass.c1.s63">Ventimore laughed.</s> <s sid="64" id="brass.c1.s64"><qs/>"I can manage to do nothing without a clerk to help me.</s> <s sid="65" id="brass.c1.s65">Your necessity is greater than mine.</s> <s sid="66" id="brass.c1.s66">Here are the plans."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="brass.c1.s67"><qs/>"I'm rather pleased with 'em myself, you know,"<qe/><sss/> said Beevor; <sse/><qs/>"that roof ought to look well, eh?</s> <s sid="68" id="brass.c1.s68">Good idea of mine lightening the slate with that ornamental tile-work along the top.</s> <s sid="69" id="brass.c1.s69">You saw I put in one of your windows with just a trifling addition.</s> <s sid="70" id="brass.c1.s70">I was almost inclined to keep both gables alike, as you suggested, but it struck me a little variety--one red brick and the other <alt-qs/>'parged'<alt-qe/>--would be more out-of-the-way."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="brass.c1.s71"><qs/>"Oh, much,"<qe/> agreed Ventimore, knowing that to disagree was useless.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="brass.c1.s72"><qs/>"Not, mind you,"<qe/><sss/> continued Beevor, <sse/><qs/>"that I believe in going in for too much originality in domestic architecture.</s> <s sid="73" id="brass.c1.s73">The average client no more wants an original house than he wants an original hat; he wants something he won't feel a fool in.</s> <s sid="74" id="brass.c1.s74">I've often thought, old man, that perhaps the reason why you haven't got on----you don't mind my speaking candidly, do you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="brass.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="brass.c1.s75"><qs/>"Not a bit,"<qe/> said Ventimore, cheerfully.</s> <s sid="76" id="brass.c1.s76"><qs/>"Candour's the cement of friendship.</s> <s sid="77" id="brass.c1.s77">Dab it on."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="brass.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="brass.c1.s78"><qs/>"Well, I was only going to say that you do yourself no good by all those confoundedly unconventional ideas of yours.</s> <s sid="79" id="brass.c1.s79">If you had your chance to-morrow, it's my belief you'd throw it away by insisting on some fantastic fad or other."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="brass.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="brass.c1.s80"><qs/>"These speculations are a trifle premature, considering that there doesn't seem the remotest prospect of my ever getting a chance at all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="brass.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="brass.c1.s81"><qs/>"I got mine before I'd set up six months,"<qe/> said Beevor.</s> <s sid="82" id="brass.c1.s82"><qs/>"The great thing, however,"<qe/><sls/> he went on, with a flavour of personal application, <sle/><qs/>"is to know how to use it when it _does_ come.</s> <s sid="83" id="brass.c1.s83">Well, I must be off if I mean to catch that one o'clock from Waterloo.</s> <s sid="84" id="brass.c1.s84">You'll see to anything that may come in for me while I'm away, won't you, and let me know?</s> <s sid="85" id="brass.c1.s85">Oh, by the way, the quantity surveyor has just sent in the quantities for that schoolroom at Woodford--do you mind running through them and seeing they're right?</s> <s sid="86" id="brass.c1.s86">And there's the specification for the new wing at Tusculum Lodge--you might draft that some time when you've nothing else to do.</s> <s sid="87" id="brass.c1.s87">You'll find all the papers on my desk.</s> <s sid="88" id="brass.c1.s88">Thanks awfully, old chap."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="brass.c1.p30"><s sid="89" id="brass.c1.s89">And Beevor hurried back to his own room, where for the next few minutes he could be heard bustling Harrison, the clerk, to make haste; then a hansom was whistled for, there were footsteps down the old stairs, the sounds of a departing vehicle on the uneven stones, and after that silence and solitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="brass.c1.p31"><s sid="90" id="brass.c1.s90">It was not in Nature to avoid feeling a little envious.</s> <s sid="91" id="brass.c1.s91">Beevor had work to do in the world: even if it chiefly consisted in profaning sylvan retreats by smug or pretentious villas, it was still work which entitled him to consideration and respect in the eyes of all right-minded persons.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="brass.c1.p32"><s sid="92" id="brass.c1.s92">And nobody believed in Horace; as yet he had never known the satisfaction of seeing the work of his brain realised in stone and brick and mortar; no building stood anywhere to bear testimony to his existence and capability long after he himself should have passed away.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="brass.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="brass.c1.s93">It was not a profitable train of thought, and, to escape from it, he went into Beevor's room and fetched the documents he had mentioned--at least they would keep him occupied until it was time to go to his club and lunch.</s> <s sid="94" id="brass.c1.s94">He had no sooner settled down to his calculations, however, when he heard a shuffling step on the landing, followed by a knock at Beevor's office-door.</s> <s sid="95" id="brass.c1.s95"><qs/>"More work for Beevor,"<qe/><sss/> he thought; <sse/><qs/>"what luck the fellow has!</s> <s sid="96" id="brass.c1.s96">I'd better go in and explain that he's just left town on business."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="brass.c1.p34"><s sid="97" id="brass.c1.s97">But on entering the adjoining room he heard the knocking repeated--this time at his own door; and hastening back to put an end to this somewhat undignified form of hide-and-seek, he discovered that this visitor at least was legitimately his, and was, in fact, no other than Professor Anthony Futvoye himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="brass.c1.p35"><s sid="98" id="brass.c1.s98">The Professor was standing in the doorway peering short-sightedly through his convex glasses, his head protruded from his loosely-fitting great-coat with an irresistible suggestion of an inquiring tortoise.</s> <s sid="99" id="brass.c1.s99">To Horace his appearance was more welcome than that of the wealthiest client--for why should Sylvia's father take the trouble to pay him this visit unless he still wished to continue the acquaintanceship?</s> <s sid="100" id="brass.c1.s100">It might even be that he was the bearer of some message or invitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="brass.c1.p36"><s sid="101" id="brass.c1.s101">So, although to an impartial eye the Professor might not seem the kind of elderly gentleman whose society would produce any wild degree of exhilaration, Horace was unfeignedly delighted to see him.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="brass.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="brass.c1.s102"><qs/>"Extremely kind of you to come and see me like this, sir,"<qe/> he said warmly, after establishing him in the solitary armchair reserved for hypothetical clients.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="brass.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="brass.c1.s103"><qs/>"Not at all.</s> <s sid="104" id="brass.c1.s104">I'm afraid your visit to Cottesmore Gardens some time ago was somewhat of a disappointment."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="brass.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="brass.c1.s105"><qs/>"A disappointment?"<qe/> echoed Horace, at a loss to know what was coming next.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="brass.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="brass.c1.s106"><qs/>"I refer to the fact--which possibly, however, escaped your notice"<qe/><sls/>--explained the Professor, scratching his scanty patch of grizzled whisker with a touch of irascibility, <sle/><qs/>"that I myself was not at home on that occasion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="brass.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="brass.c1.s107"><qs/>"Indeed, I was greatly disappointed,"<qe/><sss/> said Horace, <sse/><qs/>"though of course I know how much you are engaged.</s> <s sid="108" id="brass.c1.s108">It's all the more good of you to spare time to drop in for a chat just now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="brass.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="brass.c1.s109"><qs/>"I've not come to chat, Mr. Ventimore.</s> <s sid="110" id="brass.c1.s110">I never chat.</s> <s sid="111" id="brass.c1.s111">I wanted to see you about a matter which I thought you might be so obliging as to---- But I observe you are busy--probably too busy to attend to such a small affair."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="brass.c1.p43"><s sid="112" id="brass.c1.s112">It was clear enough now; the Professor was going to build, and had decided--could it be at Sylvia's suggestion?--to entrust the work to him!</s> <s sid="113" id="brass.c1.s113">But he contrived to subdue any self-betraying eagerness, and reply (as he could with perfect truth) that he had nothing on hand just then which he could not lay aside, and that if the Professor would let him know what he required, he would take it up at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="brass.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="brass.c1.s114"><qs/>"So much the better,"<qe/><sss/> said the Professor; <sse/><qs/>"so much the better.</s> <s sid="115" id="brass.c1.s115">Both my wife and daughter declared that it was making far too great a demand upon your good nature; but, as I told them, <alt-qs/>'I am much mistaken,'<alt-qe/> I said, 'if Mr. Ventimore's practice is so extensive that he cannot leave it for one afternoon----'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="brass.c1.p45"><s sid="116" id="brass.c1.s116">Evidently it was not a house.</s> <s sid="117" id="brass.c1.s117">Could he be needed to escort them somewhere that afternoon?</s> <s sid="118" id="brass.c1.s118">Even that was more than he had hoped for a few minutes since.</s> <s sid="119" id="brass.c1.s119">He hastened to repeat that he was perfectly free that afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="brass.c1.p46" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="brass.c1.s120"><qs/>"In that case,"<qe/><sls/> said the Professor, beginning to fumble in all his pockets--was he searching for a note in Sylvia's handwriting?--<sle/><qs/>"in that case, you will be conferring a real favour on me if you can make it convenient to attend a sale at Hammond's Auction Rooms in Covent Garden, and just bid for one or two articles on my behalf."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="brass.c1.p47" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="brass.c1.s121">Whatever disappointment Ventimore felt, it may be said to his credit that he allowed no sign of it to appear.</s> <s sid="122" id="brass.c1.s122"><qs/>"Of course I'll go, with pleasure,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"if I can be of any use."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="brass.c1.p48" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="brass.c1.s123"><qs/>"I knew I shouldn't come to you in vain,"<qe/> said the Professor.</s> <s sid="124" id="brass.c1.s124"><qs/>"I remembered your wonderful good nature, sir, in accompanying my wife and daughter on all sorts of expeditions in the blazing hot weather we had at St.</s> <s sid="125" id="brass.c1.s125">Luc--when you might have remained quietly at the hotel with me.</s> <s sid="126" id="brass.c1.s126">Not that I should trouble you now, only I have to lunch at the Oriental Club, and I've an appointment afterwards to examine and report on a recently-discovered inscribed cylinder for the Museum, which will fully occupy the rest of the afternoon, so that it's physically impossible for me to go to Hammond's myself, and I strongly object to employing a broker when I can avoid it.</s> <s sid="127" id="brass.c1.s127">Where did I put that catalogue?... Ah, here it is.</s> <s sid="128" id="brass.c1.s128">This was sent to me by the executors of my old friend, General Collingham, who died the other day.</s> <s sid="129" id="brass.c1.s129">I met him at Nakada when I was out excavating some years ago.</s> <s sid="130" id="brass.c1.s130">He was something of a collector in his way, though he knew very little about it, and, of course, was taken in right and left.</s> <s sid="131" id="brass.c1.s131">Most of his things are downright rubbish, but there are just a few lots that are worth securing, at a reasonable figure, by some one who knew what he was about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="brass.c1.p49" type="speech"><s sid="132" id="brass.c1.s132"><qs/>"But, my dear Professor,"<qe/><sls/> remonstrated Horace, not relishing this responsibility, <sle/><qs/>"I'm afraid I'm as likely as not to pick up some of the rubbish.</s> <s sid="133" id="brass.c1.s133">I've no special knowledge of Oriental curios."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="brass.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="brass.c2.s1">In spite of the fact that it was the luncheon hour when Ventimore reached Hammond's Auction Rooms, he found the big, skylighted gallery where the sale of the furniture and effects of the late General Collingham was proceeding crowded to a degree which showed that the deceased officer had some reputation as a _connoisseur_.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="brass.c2.s2">The narrow green baize tables below the auctioneer's rostrum were occupied by professional dealers, one or two of them women, who sat, paper and pencil in hand, with much the same air of apparent apathy and real vigilance that may be noticed in the Casino at Monte Carlo.</s> <s sid="3" id="brass.c2.s3">Around them stood a decorous and businesslike crowd, mostly dealers, of various types.</s> <s sid="4" id="brass.c2.s4">On a magisterial-looking bench sat the auctioneer, conducting the sale with a judicial impartiality and dignity which forbade him, even in his most laudatory comments, the faintest accent of enthusiasm.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="brass.c2.s5">The October sunshine, striking through the glazed roof, re-gilded the tarnished gas-stars, and suffused the dusty atmosphere with palest gold.</s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c2.s6">But somehow the utter absence of excitement in the crowd, the calm, methodical tone of the auctioneer, and the occasional mournful cry of <qs/>"Lot here, gentlemen!"<qe/> from the porter when any article was too large to move, all served to depress Ventimore's usually mercurial spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c2.p4"><s sid="7" id="brass.c2.s7">For all Horace knew, the collection as a whole might be of little value, but it very soon became clear that others besides Professor Futvoye had singled out such gems as there were, also that the Professor had considerably under-rated the prices they were likely to fetch.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c2.p5"><s sid="8" id="brass.c2.s8">Ventimore made his bids with all possible discretion, but time after time he found the competition for some perforated mosque lantern, engraved ewer, or ancient porcelain tile so great that his limit was soon reached, and his sole consolation was that the article eventually changed hands for sums which were very nearly double the Professor's estimate.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c2.p6"><s sid="9" id="brass.c2.s9">Several dealers and brokers, despairing of a bargain that day, left, murmuring profanities; most of those who remained ceased to take a serious interest in the proceedings, and consoled themselves with cheap witticisms at every favourable occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c2.p7"><s sid="10" id="brass.c2.s10">The sale dragged slowly on, and, what with continual disappointment and want of food, Horace began to feel so weary that he was glad, as the crowd thinned, to get a seat at one of the green baize tables, by which time the skylights had already changed from livid grey to slate colour in the deepening dusk.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c2.p9"><s sid="12" id="brass.c2.s12">The limit to which he was authorised to go was two pounds ten; but, so desperately anxious was Ventimore not to return empty-handed, that he had made up his mind to bid an extra sovereign if necessary, and say nothing about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="brass.c5.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="brass.c5.s5">What, he wondered, could have put so grotesque a fancy into his head? and then he smiled as he traced it to Sylvia's playful suggestion that the bottle might contain a <qs/>"genie,"<qe/><sls/> as did the famous jar in the <sle/><qs/>"Arabian Nights,"<qe/><sls/> and to her father's pedantic correction of the word to <sle/><qs/>"Jinnee."<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="brass.c5.s6">Upon that slight foundation his sleeping brain had built up all that elaborate fabric--a scene so vivid and a story so circumstantial and plausible that, in spite of its extravagance, he could hardly even now persuade himself that it was entirely imaginary.</s> <s sid="7" id="brass.c5.s7">The psychology of dreams is a subject which has a fascinating mystery, even for the least serious student.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c5.p3"><s sid="8" id="brass.c5.s8">As he entered the sitting-room, where his breakfast awaited him, he looked round, half expecting to find the bottle lying with its lid off in the corner, as he had last seen it in his dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c5.p6"><s sid="14" id="brass.c5.s14">But if somewhat grim of aspect, she was a good soul and devoted to Horace, in whom she took almost a maternal interest, while regretting that he was not what she called "serious-minded enough" to get on in the world.</s> <s sid="15" id="brass.c5.s15">Rapkin had wooed and married her when they were both in service, and he still took occasional jobs as an outdoor butler, though Horace suspected that his more staple form of industry was the consumption of gin-and-water and remarkably full-flavoured cigars in the basement parlour.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="brass.c5.p12"><s sid="27" id="brass.c5.s27">It certainly looked rather the better for it, and the marks or scratches on the cap were more distinguishable, but Horace was somewhat disconcerted to find that part of his dream was true--the bottle had been there.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="brass.c5.p20"><s sid="46" id="brass.c5.s46">As soon as she relieved him of her presence, he examined the bottle: there was nothing whatever inside it, which disposed of all the hopes he had entertained from that quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="brass.c5.p21"><s sid="47" id="brass.c5.s47">It was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an hallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes (for he now believed in the fumes) which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition of some long-buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the air.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="brass.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="brass.c5.s48">If any further explanation were needed, the accidental blow to the back of his head, together with the latent suggestion from the <qs/>"Arabian Nights,"<qe/> would amply provide it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="brass.c5.p23"><s sid="49" id="brass.c5.s49">So, having settled these points to his entire satisfaction, he went to his office in Great Cloister Street, which he now had entirely to himself, and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor on which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day before by the Professor.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="brass.c5.p24"><s sid="50" id="brass.c5.s50">The work was more or less mechanical, and could bring him no credit and little thanks, but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly whatever he undertook, and as he sat there by his wide-open window he soon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="brass.c5.p25"><s sid="51" id="brass.c5.s51">So much so that, even when the light became obscured for a moment, as if by some large and opaque body in passing, he did not look up immediately, and, when he did, was surprised to find the only armchair occupied by a portly person, who seemed to be trying to recover his breath.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="brass.c8.p3"><s sid="8" id="brass.c8.s8">As to the dinner, his mind was tolerably easy, for he had settled the remaining details of the _menu_ with his landlady that morning, and he could hope that without being so sumptuous as to excite the Professor's wrath, it would still be not altogether unworthy--and what goods could be rare and dainty enough?--to be set before Sylvia.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="brass.c8.p4"><s sid="9" id="brass.c8.s9">He would have liked to provide champagne, but he knew that wine would savour of ostentation in the Professor's judgment, so he had contented himself instead with claret, a sound vintage which he knew he could depend upon.</s> <s sid="10" id="brass.c8.s10">Flowers, he thought, were clearly permissible, and he had called at a florist's on his way and got some chrysanthemums of palest yellow and deepest terra-cotta, the finest he could see.</s> <s sid="11" id="brass.c8.s11">Some of them would look well on the centre of the table in an old Nankin blue-and-white bowl he had; the rest he could arrange about the room: there would just be time to see to all that before dressing.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="brass.c8.p5"><s sid="12" id="brass.c8.s12">Occupied with these thoughts, he turned into Vincent Square, which looked vaster than ever with the murky haze, enclosed by its high railings, and under a wide expanse of steel-blue sky, across which the clouds were driving fast like ships in full sail scudding for harbour before a storm.</s> <s sid="13" id="brass.c8.s13">Against the mist below, the young and nearly leafless trees showed flat, black profiles as of pressed seaweed, and the sky immediately above the house-tops was tinged with a sullen red from miles of lighted streets; from the river came the long-drawn tooting of tugs, mingled with the more distant wail and hysterical shrieks of railway engines on the Lambeth lines.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="brass.c8.p6"><s sid="14" id="brass.c8.s14">And now he reached the old semi-detached house in which he lodged, and noticed for the first time how the trellis-work of the veranda made, with the bared creepers and hanging baskets, a kind of decorative pattern against the windows, which were suffused with a roseate glow that looked warm and comfortable and hospitable.</s> <s sid="15" id="brass.c8.s15">He wondered whether Sylvia would notice it when she arrived.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="brass.c8.p7"><s sid="16" id="brass.c8.s16">He passed under the old wrought-iron arch that once held an oil-lamp, and up a short but rather steep flight of steps, which led to a brick porch built out at the side.</s> <s sid="17" id="brass.c8.s17">Then he let himself in, and stood spellbound with perplexed amazement,--for he was in a strange house.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="brass.c8.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="brass.c8.s19"><qs/>"I must have mistaken the number,"<qe/> he thought, quite forgetting that his latch-key had fitted, and he was just about to retreat before his intrusion was discovered, when the hangings parted, and Mrs. Rapkin presented herself, making so deplorably incongruous a figure in such surroundings, and looking so bewildered and woebegone, that Horace, in spite of his own increasing uneasiness, had some difficulty in keeping his gravity.</s> </p>

<p pid="130" id="brass.c11.p130"><s sid="291" id="brass.c11.s291">What he felt chiefly was the new barrier that this event must raise between himself and Sylvia; to do him justice, the mere fact that the father of his _fiancee_ was a mule did not lessen his ardour in the slightest.</s> <s sid="292" id="brass.c11.s292">Even if he had felt no personal responsibility for the calamity, he loved Sylvia far too well to be deterred by it, and few family cupboards are without a skeleton of some sort.</s> </p>
