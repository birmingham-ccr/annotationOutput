<p pid="1" id="pan.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="pan.c1.s1">All children, except one, grow up.</s> <s sid="2" id="pan.c1.s2">They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this.</s> <s sid="3" id="pan.c1.s3">One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother.</s> <s sid="4" id="pan.c1.s4">I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, <qs/>"Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"<qe/></s> <s sid="5" id="pan.c1.s5">This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.</s> <s sid="6" id="pan.c1.s6">You always know after you are two.</s> <s sid="7" id="pan.c1.s7">Two is the beginning of the end.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pan.c1.p2"><s sid="8" id="pan.c1.s8">Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.</s> <s sid="9" id="pan.c1.s9">She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.</s> <s sid="10" id="pan.c1.s10">Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pan.c1.p3"><s sid="11" id="pan.c1.s11">The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.</s> <s sid="12" id="pan.c1.s12">He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss.</s> <s sid="13" id="pan.c1.s13">He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.</s> <s sid="14" id="pan.c1.s14">Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pan.c1.p4"><s sid="15" id="pan.c1.s15">Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him.</s> <s sid="16" id="pan.c1.s16">He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.</s> <s sid="17" id="pan.c1.s17">Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pan.c1.p5"><s sid="18" id="pan.c1.s18">Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.</s> <s sid="19" id="pan.c1.s19">She drew them when she should have been totting up.</s> <s sid="20" id="pan.c1.s20">They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pan.c1.p6"><s sid="21" id="pan.c1.s21">Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pan.c1.p7"><s sid="22" id="pan.c1.s22">For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed.</s> <s sid="23" id="pan.c1.s23">Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly.</s> <s sid="24" id="pan.c1.s24">She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="pan.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="pan.c1.s25"><qs/>"Now don't interrupt,"<qe/> he would beg of her.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="pan.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="pan.c1.s26"><qs/>"I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that moving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don't speak, my own--and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot and carry child--there, you've done it!--did I say nine nine seven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="pan.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="pan.c1.s27"><qs/>"Of course we can, George,"<qe/> she cried.</s> <s sid="28" id="pan.c1.s28">But she was prejudiced in Wendy's favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="pan.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="pan.c1.s29"><qs/>"Remember mumps,"<qe/> he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again.</s> <s sid="30" id="pan.c1.s30"><qs/>"Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings--don't speak--measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don't waggle your finger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings"<qe/>--and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="pan.c1.p12"><s sid="31" id="pan.c1.s31">There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pan.c1.p13"><s sid="32" id="pan.c1.s32">Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse.</s> <s sid="33" id="pan.c1.s33">As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her.</s> <s sid="34" id="pan.c1.s34">She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.</s> <s sid="35" id="pan.c1.s35">She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse.</s> <s sid="36" id="pan.c1.s36">How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry.</s> <s sid="37" id="pan.c1.s37">Of course her kennel was in the nursery.</s> <s sid="38" id="pan.c1.s38">She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat.</s> <s sid="39" id="pan.c1.s39">She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on.</s> <s sid="40" id="pan.c1.s40">It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.</s> <s sid="41" id="pan.c1.s41">On John's footer [in England soccer was called football, "footer" for short] days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain.</s> <s sid="42" id="pan.c1.s42">There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait.</s> <s sid="43" id="pan.c1.s43">They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.</s> <s sid="44" id="pan.c1.s44">They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk.</s> <s sid="45" id="pan.c1.s45">She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pan.c1.p14"><s sid="46" id="pan.c1.s46">No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="pan.c1.p15"><s sid="47" id="pan.c1.s47">He had his position in the city to consider.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="pan.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="pan.c1.s48">Nana also troubled him in another way.</s> <s sid="49" id="pan.c1.s49">He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him.</s> <s sid="50" id="pan.c1.s50"><qs/>"I know she admires you tremendously, George,"<qe/> Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father.</s> <s sid="51" id="pan.c1.s51">Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join.</s> <s sid="52" id="pan.c1.s52">Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again.</s> <s sid="53" id="pan.c1.s53">The gaiety of those romps!</s> <s sid="54" id="pan.c1.s54">And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it.</s> <s sid="55" id="pan.c1.s55">There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="pan.c1.p17"><s sid="56" id="pan.c1.s56">Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds.</s> <s sid="57" id="pan.c1.s57">It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.</s> <s sid="58" id="pan.c1.s58">If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.</s> <s sid="59" id="pan.c1.s59">It is quite like tidying up drawers.</s> <s sid="60" id="pan.c1.s60">You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.</s> <s sid="61" id="pan.c1.s61">When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="pan.c1.p18"><s sid="62" id="pan.c1.s62">I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.</s> <s sid="63" id="pan.c1.s63">Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.</s> <s sid="64" id="pan.c1.s64">There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.</s> <s sid="65" id="pan.c1.s65">It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="pan.c1.p19"><s sid="66" id="pan.c1.s66">Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.</s> <s sid="67" id="pan.c1.s67">John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.</s> <s sid="68" id="pan.c1.s68">John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.</s> <s sid="69" id="pan.c1.s69">John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.</s> <s sid="70" id="pan.c1.s70">On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat].</s> <s sid="71" id="pan.c1.s71">We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="pan.c1.p20"><s sid="72" id="pan.c1.s72">Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.</s> <s sid="73" id="pan.c1.s73">When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.</s> <s sid="74" id="pan.c1.s74">That is why there are night-lights.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="pan.c1.p21"><s sid="75" id="pan.c1.s75">Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.</s> <s sid="76" id="pan.c1.s76">She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him.</s> <s sid="77" id="pan.c1.s77">The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="pan.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="pan.c1.s78"><qs/>"Yes, he is rather cocky,"<qe/> Wendy admitted with regret.</s> <s sid="79" id="pan.c1.s79">Her mother had been questioning her.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="pan.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="pan.c1.s80"><qs/>"But who is he, my pet?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="pan.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="pan.c1.s81"><qs/>"He is Peter Pan, you know, mother."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="pan.c1.p25"><s sid="82" id="pan.c1.s82">At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.</s> <s sid="83" id="pan.c1.s83">There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.</s> <s sid="84" id="pan.c1.s84">She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="pan.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="pan.c1.s85"><qs/>"Besides,"<qe/><sss/> she said to Wendy, <sse/><qs/>"he would be grown up by this time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="pan.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="pan.c1.s86"><qs/>"Oh no, he isn't grown up,"<qe/><sss/> Wendy assured her confidently, <sse/><qs/>"and he is just my size."<qe/></s> <s sid="87" id="pan.c1.s87">She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="pan.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="pan.c1.s88">Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.</s> <s sid="89" id="pan.c1.s89"><qs/>"Mark my words,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.</s> <s sid="90" id="pan.c1.s90">Leave it alone, and it will blow over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="pan.c1.p29"><s sid="91" id="pan.c1.s91">But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="pan.c1.p30"><s sid="92" id="pan.c1.s92">Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.</s> <s sid="93" id="pan.c1.s93">For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him.</s> <s sid="94" id="pan.c1.s94">It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.</s> <s sid="95" id="pan.c1.s95">Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="pan.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="pan.c1.s96"><qs/>"I do believe it is that Peter again!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="pan.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="pan.c1.s97"><qs/>"Whatever do you mean, Wendy?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="pan.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="pan.c1.s98"><qs/>"It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,"<qe/> Wendy said, sighing.</s> <s sid="99" id="pan.c1.s99">She was a tidy child.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="pan.c1.p34"><s sid="100" id="pan.c1.s100">She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.</s> <s sid="101" id="pan.c1.s101">Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="pan.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="pan.c1.s102"><qs/>"What nonsense you talk, precious.</s> <s sid="103" id="pan.c1.s103">No one can get into the house without knocking."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="pan.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="pan.c1.s104"><qs/>"I think he comes in by the window,"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="pan.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="pan.c1.s105"><qs/>"My love, it is three floors up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="pan.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="pan.c1.s106"><qs/>"Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="pan.c1.p39"><s sid="107" id="pan.c1.s107">It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="pan.c1.p40"><s sid="108" id="pan.c1.s108">Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="pan.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="pan.c1.s109"><qs/>"My child,"<qe/><sss/> the mother cried, <sse/><qs/>"why did you not tell me of this before?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="pan.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="pan.c1.s110"><qs/>"I forgot,"<qe/> said Wendy lightly.</s> <s sid="111" id="pan.c1.s111">She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="pan.c1.p43"><s sid="112" id="pan.c1.s112">Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="pan.c1.p44"><s sid="113" id="pan.c1.s113">But, on the other hand, there were the leaves.</s> <s sid="114" id="pan.c1.s114">Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England.</s> <s sid="115" id="pan.c1.s115">She crawled about the floor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot.</s> <s sid="116" id="pan.c1.s116">She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls.</s> <s sid="117" id="pan.c1.s117">She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="pan.c1.p45"><s sid="118" id="pan.c1.s118">Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="pan.c1.p46"><s sid="119" id="pan.c1.s119">But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="pan.c1.p47"><s sid="120" id="pan.c1.s120">On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed.</s> <s sid="121" id="pan.c1.s121">It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="pan.c1.p48"><s sid="122" id="pan.c1.s122">All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="pan.c1.p49"><s sid="123" id="pan.c1.s123">It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts.</s> <s sid="124" id="pan.c1.s124">The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap.</s> <s sid="125" id="pan.c1.s125">Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully.</s> <s sid="126" id="pan.c1.s126">She was asleep.</s> <s sid="127" id="pan.c1.s127">Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire.</s> <s sid="128" id="pan.c1.s128">There should have been a fourth night-light.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="pan.c1.p50"><s sid="129" id="pan.c1.s129">While she slept she had a dream.</s> <s sid="130" id="pan.c1.s130">She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it.</s> <s sid="131" id="pan.c1.s131">He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children.</s> <s sid="132" id="pan.c1.s132">Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.</s> <s sid="133" id="pan.c1.s133">But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="pan.c1.p51"><s sid="134" id="pan.c1.s134">The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.</s> <s sid="135" id="pan.c1.s135">He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="pan.c1.p52"><s sid="136" id="pan.c1.s136">She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan.</s> <s sid="137" id="pan.c1.s137">If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss.</s> <s sid="138" id="pan.c1.s138">He was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.</s> <s sid="139" id="pan.c1.s139">When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pan.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="pan.c2.s1">Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out.</s> <s sid="2" id="pan.c2.s2">She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window.</s> <s sid="3" id="pan.c2.s3">Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pan.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="pan.c2.s4">She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow.</s> <s sid="5" id="pan.c2.s5">As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pan.c2.p3"><s sid="6" id="pan.c2.s6">You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pan.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="pan.c2.s7">Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.</s> <s sid="8" id="pan.c2.s8">She hung it out at the window, meaning <qs/>"He is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pan.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="pan.c2.s9">But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house.</s> <s sid="10" id="pan.c2.s10">She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:</s> <s sid="11" id="pan.c2.s11"><qs/>"It all comes of having a dog for a nurse."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pan.c2.p6"><s sid="12" id="pan.c2.s12">She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband.</s> <s sid="13" id="pan.c2.s13">Ah me!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pan.c2.p7"><s sid="14" id="pan.c2.s14">The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.</s> <s sid="15" id="pan.c2.s15">Of course it was a Friday.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="pan.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="pan.c2.s16"><qs/>"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,"<qe/> she used to say afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her, holding her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="pan.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="pan.c2.s17"><qs/>"No, no,"<qe/><sss/> Mr. Darling always said, <sse/><qs/>"I am responsible for it all.</s> <s sid="18" id="pan.c2.s18">I, George Darling, did it.</s> <s sid="19" id="pan.c2.s19">MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA."<qe/></s> <s sid="20" id="pan.c2.s20">He had had a classical education.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="pan.c2.p10"><s sid="21" id="pan.c2.s21">They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="pan.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="pan.c2.s22"><qs/>"If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,"<qe/> Mrs. Darling said.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="pan.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="pan.c2.s23"><qs/>"If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl,"<qe/> said Mr. Darling.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pan.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="pan.c2.s24"><qs/>"If only I had pretended to like the medicine,"<qe/> was what Nana's wet eyes said.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pan.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="pan.c2.s25"><qs/>"My liking for parties, George."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="pan.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="pan.c2.s26"><qs/>"My fatal gift of humour, dearest."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="pan.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="pan.c2.s27"><qs/>"My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="pan.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="pan.c2.s28">Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, <qs/>"It's true, it's true, they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse."<qe/></s> <s sid="29" id="pan.c2.s29">Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana's eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="pan.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="pan.c2.s30"><qs/>"That fiend!"<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="pan.c2.s31">Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="pan.c2.p19"><s sid="32" id="pan.c2.s32">They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening.</s> <s sid="33" id="pan.c2.s33">It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="pan.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="pan.c2.s34"><qs/>"I won't go to bed,"<qe/><sls/> he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, <sle/><qs/>"I won't, I won't.</s> <s sid="35" id="pan.c2.s35">Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.</s> <s sid="36" id="pan.c2.s36">Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana.</s> <s sid="37" id="pan.c2.s37">I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="pan.c2.p21"><s sid="38" id="pan.c2.s38">Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown.</s> <s sid="39" id="pan.c2.s39">She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her.</s> <s sid="40" id="pan.c2.s40">She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it.</s> <s sid="41" id="pan.c2.s41">Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="pan.c2.p22"><s sid="42" id="pan.c2.s42">She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying:</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="pan.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="pan.c2.s43"><qs/>"I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,"<qe/> in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="pan.c2.p24"><s sid="44" id="pan.c2.s44">Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="pan.c2.p25"><s sid="45" id="pan.c2.s45">Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="pan.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="pan.c2.s46">Michael had nearly cried.</s> <s sid="47" id="pan.c2.s47"><qs/>"Nobody wants me,"<qe/> he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="pan.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="pan.c2.s48"><qs/>"I do,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"I so want a third child."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="pan.c2.p28" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="pan.c2.s49"><qs/>"Boy or girl?"<qe/> asked Michael, not too hopefully.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="pan.c2.p29" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="pan.c2.s50"><qs/>"Boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="pan.c2.p30"><s sid="51" id="pan.c2.s51">Then he had leapt into her arms.</s> <s sid="52" id="pan.c2.s52">Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael's last night in the nursery.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="pan.c2.p31"><s sid="53" id="pan.c2.s53">They go on with their recollections.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="pan.c2.p32" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="pan.c2.s54"><qs/>"It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?"<qe/></s> <s sid="55" id="pan.c2.s55">Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="pan.c2.p33"><s sid="56" id="pan.c2.s56">Perhaps there was some excuse for him.</s> <s sid="57" id="pan.c2.s57">He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie.</s> <s sid="58" id="pan.c2.s58">It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie.</s> <s sid="59" id="pan.c2.s59">Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="pan.c2.p34"><s sid="60" id="pan.c2.s60">This was such an occasion.</s> <s sid="61" id="pan.c2.s61">He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="pan.c2.p35" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="pan.c2.s62"><qs/>"Why, what is the matter, father dear?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="pan.c2.p36" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="pan.c2.s63"><qs/>"Matter!"<qe/> he yelled; he really yelled.</s> <s sid="64" id="pan.c2.s64"><qs/>"This tie, it will not tie."<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="pan.c2.s65">He became dangerously sarcastic.</s> <s sid="66" id="pan.c2.s66"><qs/>"Not round my neck!</s> <s sid="67" id="pan.c2.s67">Round the bed-post!</s> <s sid="68" id="pan.c2.s68">Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no!</s> <s sid="69" id="pan.c2.s69">Oh dear no! begs to be excused!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="pan.c2.p37" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="pan.c2.s70">He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, <qs/>"I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="pan.c2.p38" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="pan.c2.s71">Even then Mrs. Darling was placid.</s> <s sid="72" id="pan.c2.s72"><qs/>"Let me try, dear,"<qe/> she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate decided.</s> <s sid="73" id="pan.c2.s73">Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="pan.c2.p39" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="pan.c2.s74"><qs/>"How wildly we romped!"<qe/> says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="pan.c2.p41" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="pan.c2.s77"><qs/>"O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did you get to know me, mother?'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="pan.c2.p42" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="pan.c2.s78"><qs/>"I remember!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="pan.c2.p45"><s sid="81" id="pan.c2.s81">The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs.</s> <s sid="82" id="pan.c2.s82">They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming.</s> <s sid="83" id="pan.c2.s83">Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="pan.c2.p46" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="pan.c2.s84"><qs/>"George, Nana is a treasure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="pan.c2.p47" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="pan.c2.s85"><qs/>"No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="pan.c2.p48" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="pan.c2.s86"><qs/>"Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="pan.c2.p49" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="pan.c2.s87"><qs/>"I wonder,"<qe/><sss/> Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, <sse/><qs/>"I wonder."<qe/></s> <s sid="88" id="pan.c2.s88">It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy.</s> <s sid="89" id="pan.c2.s89">At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="pan.c2.p50" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="pan.c2.s90"><qs/>"It is nobody I know,"<qe/><sls/> he said, examining it carefully, <sle/><qs/>"but it does look a scoundrel."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="pan.c2.p51" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="pan.c2.s91"><qs/>"We were still discussing it, you remember,"<qe/><sss/> says Mr. Darling, <sse/><qs/>"when Nana came in with Michael's medicine.</s> <s sid="92" id="pan.c2.s92">You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="pan.c2.p52" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="pan.c2.s93">Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine.</s> <s sid="94" id="pan.c2.s94">If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said reprovingly, <qs/>"Be a man, Michael."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="pan.c2.p53" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="pan.c2.s95"><qs/>"Won't; won't!"<qe/></s> <s sid="96" id="pan.c2.s96">Michael cried naughtily.</s> <s sid="97" id="pan.c2.s97">Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="pan.c2.p54" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="pan.c2.s98"><qs/>"Mother, don't pamper him,"<qe/> he called after her.</s> <s sid="99" id="pan.c2.s99"><qs/>"Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur.</s> <s sid="100" id="pan.c2.s100">I said, 'Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="pan.c2.p55" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="pan.c2.s101">He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, <qs/>"That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="pan.c2.p56" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="pan.c2.s102"><qs/>"Ever so much nastier,"<qe/><sss/> Mr. Darling said bravely, <sse/><qs/>"and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pan.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="pan.c7.s1">One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees.</s> <s sid="2" id="pan.c7.s2">Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size.</s> <s sid="3" id="pan.c7.s3">Once you fitted, you drew in [let out] your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up.</s> <s sid="4" id="pan.c7.s4">Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pan.c7.p2"><s sid="5" id="pan.c7.s5">But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.</s> <s sid="6" id="pan.c7.s6">Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you fit.</s> <s sid="7" id="pan.c7.s7">Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pan.c7.p3"><s sid="8" id="pan.c7.s8">Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pan.c7.p5"><s sid="18" id="pan.c7.s18">It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.</s> <s sid="19" id="pan.c7.s19">But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.</s> <s sid="20" id="pan.c7.s20">It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious [particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.</s> <s sid="21" id="pan.c7.s21">No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room] and bed-chamber combined.</s> <s sid="22" id="pan.c7.s22">The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in season.</s> <s sid="23" id="pan.c7.s23">Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin.</s> <s sid="24" id="pan.c7.s24">There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself.</s> <s sid="25" id="pan.c7.s25">Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pan.c7.p6"><s sid="26" id="pan.c7.s26">I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do.</s> <s sid="27" id="pan.c7.s27">Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground.</s> <s sid="28" id="pan.c7.s28">The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same.</s> <s sid="29" id="pan.c7.s29">You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel stodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it.</s> <s sid="30" id="pan.c7.s30">Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.</s> <s sid="31" id="pan.c7.s31">Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pan.c7.p7"><s sid="32" id="pan.c7.s32">Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed.</s> <s sid="33" id="pan.c7.s33">Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="pan.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="pan.c7.s34">When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, <qs/>"Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="pan.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="pan.c7.s39">As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her?</s> <s sid="40" id="pan.c7.s40">This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland.</s> <s sid="41" id="pan.c7.s41">But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind.</s> <s sid="42" id="pan.c7.s42">What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.</s> <s sid="43" id="pan.c7.s43">These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.</s> <s sid="44" id="pan.c7.s44">The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round.</s> <s sid="45" id="pan.c7.s45">They were the most ordinary questions--<qs/>"What was the colour of Mother's eyes?</s> <s sid="46" id="pan.c7.s46">Which was taller, Father or Mother?</s> <s sid="47" id="pan.c7.s47">Was Mother blonde or brunette?</s> <s sid="48" id="pan.c7.s48">Answer all three questions if possible."<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="pan.c7.s49"><qs/>"(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared.</s> <s sid="50" id="pan.c7.s50">Only one of these to be attempted."<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="pan.c7.s51">Or <qs/>"(1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe Father's laugh; (3) Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="pan.c7.p12"><s sid="52" id="pan.c7.s52">They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even John made.</s> <s sid="53" id="pan.c7.s53">Of course the only boy who replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pan.c7.p13"><s sid="54" id="pan.c7.s54">Peter did not compete.</s> <s sid="55" id="pan.c7.s55">For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell; not the smallest word.</s> <s sid="56" id="pan.c7.s56">He was above all that sort of thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pan.c7.p14"><s sid="57" id="pan.c7.s57">By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense.</s> <s sid="58" id="pan.c7.s58">What was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on.</s> <s sid="59" id="pan.c7.s59">Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="pan.c7.p15"><s sid="60" id="pan.c7.s60">Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.</s> <s sid="61" id="pan.c7.s61">It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.</s> <s sid="62" id="pan.c7.s62">To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do.</s> <s sid="63" id="pan.c7.s63">He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health.</s> <s sid="64" id="pan.c7.s64">For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="pan.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="pan.c7.s65">He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not.</s> <s sid="66" id="pan.c7.s66">He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.</s> <s sid="67" id="pan.c7.s67">Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale.</s> <s sid="68" id="pan.c7.s68">But she was never quite sure, you know.</s> <s sid="69" id="pan.c7.s69">There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.</s> <s sid="70" id="pan.c7.s70">To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island.</s> <s sid="71" id="pan.c7.s71">The difficulty is which one to choose.</s> <s sid="72" id="pan.c7.s72">Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch?</s> <s sid="73" id="pan.c7.s73">It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides.</s> <s sid="74" id="pan.c7.s74">At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, <qs/>"I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?"<qe/></s> <s sid="75" id="pan.c7.s75">And Tootles answered, <qs/>"Redskin; what are you, Nibs?"<qe/><sss/> and Nibs said, <sse/><qs/>"Redskin; what are you Twin?"<qe/> and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="pan.c7.p17"><s sid="76" id="pan.c7.s76">The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.</s> <s sid="77" id="pan.c7.s77">Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks.</s> <s sid="78" id="pan.c7.s78">Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="pan.c7.p18"><s sid="79" id="pan.c7.s79">Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="pan.c7.p19"><s sid="80" id="pan.c7.s80">Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed.</s> <s sid="81" id="pan.c7.s81">That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one.</s> <s sid="82" id="pan.c7.s82">A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.</s> <s sid="83" id="pan.c7.s83">Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back.</s> <s sid="84" id="pan.c7.s84">Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="pan.c7.p20"><s sid="85" id="pan.c7.s85">Which of these adventures shall we choose?</s> <s sid="86" id="pan.c7.s86">The best way will be to toss for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="pan.c7.p21"><s sid="87" id="pan.c7.s87">I have tossed, and the lagoon has won.</s> <s sid="88" id="pan.c7.s88">This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won.</s> <s sid="89" id="pan.c7.s89">Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pan.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="pan.c8.s1">If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.</s> <s sid="2" id="pan.c8.s2">But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon.</s> <s sid="3" id="pan.c8.s3">This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pan.c8.p2"><s sid="4" id="pan.c8.s4">The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth.</s> <s sid="5" id="pan.c8.s5">You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them.</s> <s sid="6" id="pan.c8.s6">When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pan.c8.p3"><s sid="7" id="pan.c8.s7">They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky.</s> <s sid="8" id="pan.c8.s8">He gave Wendy one of their combs.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pan.c8.p4"><s sid="9" id="pan.c8.s9">The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.</s> <s sid="10" id="pan.c8.s10">She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles.</s> <s sid="11" id="pan.c8.s11">The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.</s> <s sid="12" id="pan.c8.s12">The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands.</s> <s sid="13" id="pan.c8.s13">Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pan.c8.p5"><s sid="14" id="pan.c8.s14">But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared.</s> <s sid="15" id="pan.c8.s15">Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it.</s> <s sid="16" id="pan.c8.s16">This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pan.c8.p6"><s sid="17" id="pan.c8.s17">It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal.</s> <s sid="18" id="pan.c8.s18">Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe.</s> <s sid="19" id="pan.c8.s19">So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.</s> </p>
