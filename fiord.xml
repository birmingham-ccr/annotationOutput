<title>Feats on the Fiord</title>
<author>Harriet Martineau</author>
<p pid="1" id="fiord.c0.p1"><s>INTRODUCTION.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="fiord.c0.p2"><s>Miss Martineau's Norwegian romance won its way long since into the hearts of children in this country.</s> <s>The unhackneyed setting to the incidents of the tale distinguish it from thousands of more ordinary children's stories; nor is there any other tale so well-known having its scenes laid in the land of the fiords.</s> <s>It is quite safe to add that perhaps no other author has felt so strongly and communicated so convincingly the mystic charm of these northern lagoons with their still depths and reflections, their inaccessible walls of rock and their teeming wild-fowl life.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="fiord.c0.p3"><s>This mystic charm is deepened in the book by the thread of popular superstition which runs throughout the episodes and, in fact, gives rise to them.</s> <s>Miss Martineau's _denouements_ were calculated to shatter the follies of belief in Nipen and other supernatural agents; but her own crusading traffic in them rather endears them to the imagination of the reader and certainly supplies a fascination which the most sceptical of young readers would be sorry to miss.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="fiord.c0.p4"><s>The author also brings home to the youthful mind the wonder of the physiographical peculiarities of northern latitudes.</s> <s>The book opens with the long nights and ends with the long days.</s> <s>The midnight sun and the northern lights play their parts, whilst the beautiful simplicity of farm-life in the Arctic circle is unfolded with authoritative interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="fiord.c0.p5"><s>As for the hero, young Oddo, he is a prince among dauntless boys, yet he never oversteps the bounds of true boyishness.</s> <s>He would be a hero anywhere; but as a leading character in this romance, combined with all the charm of natural effect in which he moves, he makes _Feats on the Fiord_ a book to be classed among the few best of its kind.</s> </p>

<title>BOOK 1.</title>
<p pid="1" id="fiord.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="fiord.c1.s1">Every one who has looked at the map of Norway must have been struck with the singular character of its coast.</s> <s sid="2" id="fiord.c1.s2">On the map it looks so jagged; a strange mixture of land and sea.</s> <s sid="3" id="fiord.c1.s3">On the spot, however, this coast is very sublime.</s> <s sid="4" id="fiord.c1.s4">The long straggling promontories are mountainous, towering ridges of rock, springing up in precipices from the water; while the bays between them, instead of being rounded with shelving sandy shores, on which the sea tumbles its waves, as in bays of our coast, are, in fact, long narrow valleys, filled with sea, instead of being laid out in fields and meadows.</s> <s sid="5" id="fiord.c1.s5">The high rocky banks shelter these deep bays (called fiords) from almost every wind; so that their waters are usually as still as those of a lake.</s> <s sid="6" id="fiord.c1.s6">For days and weeks together, they reflect each separate tree-top of the pine-forests which clothe the mountain sides, the mirror being broken only by the leap of some sportive fish, or the oars of the boatman as he goes to inspect the sea-fowl from islet to islet of the fiord, or carries out his nets or his rod to catch the sea-trout, or char, or cod, or herrings, which abound, in their seasons, on the coast of Norway.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="fiord.c1.p2"><s sid="7" id="fiord.c1.s7">It is difficult to say whether these fiords are the most beautiful in summer or in winter.</s> <s sid="8" id="fiord.c1.s8">In summer, they glitter with golden sunshine; and purple and green shadows from the mountain and forest lie on them; and these may be more lovely than the faint light of the winter noons of those latitudes, and the snowy pictures of frozen peaks which then show themselves on the surface: but before the day is half over, out come the stars--the glorious stars, which shine like nothing that we have ever seen.</s> <s sid="9" id="fiord.c1.s9">There the planets cast a faint shadow, as the young moon does with us; and these planets and the constellations of the sky, as they silently glide over from peak to peak of these rocky passes, are imaged on the waters so clearly that the fisherman, as he unmoors his boat for his evening task, feels as if he were about to shoot forth his vessel into another heaven, and to cleave his way among the stars.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="fiord.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="fiord.c1.s10">Still as everything is to the eye, sometimes for a hundred miles together along these deep sea-valleys, there is rarely silence.</s> <s sid="11" id="fiord.c1.s11">The ear is kept awake by a thousand voices.</s> <s sid="12" id="fiord.c1.s12">In the summer, there are cataracts leaping from ledge to ledge of the rocks; and there is the bleating of the kids that browse there, and the flap of the great eagle's wings, as it dashes abroad from its eyrie, and the cries of whole clouds of sea-birds which inhabit the islets; and all these sounds are mingled and multiplied by the strong echoes, till they become a din as loud as that of a city.</s> <s sid="13" id="fiord.c1.s13">Even at night, when the flocks are in the fold, and the birds at roost, and the echoes themselves seem to be asleep, there is occasionally a sweet music heard, too soft for even the listening ear to catch by day.</s> <s sid="14" id="fiord.c1.s14">There is the rumble of some avalanche, as, after a drifting storm, a mass of snow too heavy to keep its place slides and tumbles from the mountain peak.</s> <s sid="15" id="fiord.c1.s15">Wherever there is a nook between the rocks on the shore, where a man may build a house, and clear a field or two;--wherever there is a platform beside the cataract where the sawyer may plant his mill, and make a path from it to join some great road, there is a human habitation, and the sounds that belong to it.</s> <s sid="16" id="fiord.c1.s16">Thence, in winter nights, come music and laughter, and the tread of dancers, and the hum of many voices.</s> <s sid="17" id="fiord.c1.s17">The Norwegians are a social and hospitable people, and they hold their gay meetings in defiance of their Arctic climate, through every season of the year.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="fiord.c1.p4"><s sid="18" id="fiord.c1.s18">On a January night, a hundred years ago, there was great merriment in the house of a farmer who had fixed his abode within the Arctic circle, in Nordland, not far from the foot of Sulitelma, the highest mountain in Norway.</s> <s sid="19" id="fiord.c1.s19">This dwelling, with its few fields about it, was in a recess between the rocks, on the shore of the fiord, about five miles from Saltdalen, and two miles from the junction of the Salten's Elv (river) with the fiord.</s> <s sid="20" id="fiord.c1.s20">The occasion, on the particular January day mentioned above, was the betrothment of one of the house-maidens to a young farm servant of the establishment.</s> <s sid="21" id="fiord.c1.s21">It was merely an engagement to be married; but this engagement is a much more formal and public affair in Norway (and indeed wherever the people belong to the Lutheran church) than with us.</s> <s sid="22" id="fiord.c1.s22">According to the rites of the Lutheran church, there are two ceremonies--one when a couple become engaged, and another when they are married.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="fiord.c1.p5"><s sid="23" id="fiord.c1.s23">As Madame Erlingsen had two daughters growing up, and they were no less active than the girls of a Norwegian household usually are, she had occasion for only two maidens to assist in the business of the dwelling and the dairy.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="fiord.c1.p6"><s sid="24" id="fiord.c1.s24">Of these two, the younger, Erica, was the maiden betrothed to-day.</s> <s sid="25" id="fiord.c1.s25">No one perhaps rejoiced so much at the event as her mistress, both for Erica's sake, and on account of her own two young daughters.</s> <s sid="26" id="fiord.c1.s26">Erica was not the best companion for them; and the servants of a Norwegian farmer are necessarily the companions of the daughters of the house.</s> <s sid="27" id="fiord.c1.s27">There was nothing wrong in Erica's conduct or temper towards the family.</s> <s sid="28" id="fiord.c1.s28">But she had sustained a shock which hurt her spirits, and increased a weakness which she owed to her mother.</s> <s sid="29" id="fiord.c1.s29">Her mother, a widow, had brought up her child in all the superstitions of the country, some of which remain in full strength even to this day, and were then very powerful; and the poor woman's death at last confirmed the lessons of her life.</s> <s sid="30" id="fiord.c1.s30">She had stayed too long, one autumn day, at the Erlingsen's and, being benighted on her return, and suddenly seized and bewildered by the cold, had wandered from the road, and was found frozen to death in a recess of the forest which it was surprising that she should have reached.</s> <s sid="31" id="fiord.c1.s31">Erica never believed that she did reach this spot of her own accord.</s> <s sid="32" id="fiord.c1.s32">Having had some fears before of the Wood-Demon having been offended by one of the family, Erica regarded this accident as a token of his vengeance.</s> <s sid="33" id="fiord.c1.s33">She said this when she first heard of her mother's death; and no reasonings from the zealous pastor of the district, no soothing from her mistress, could shake her persuasion.</s> <s sid="34" id="fiord.c1.s34">She listened with submission, wiping away her quiet tears as they discoursed; but no one could ever get her to say that she doubted whether there was a Wood-Demon, or that she was not afraid of what he would do if offended.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="fiord.c1.p7"><s sid="35" id="fiord.c1.s35">Erlingsen and his wife always treated her superstition as a weakness; and when she was not present, they ridiculed it.</s> <s sid="36" id="fiord.c1.s36">Yet they saw that it had its effect on their daughters.</s> <s sid="37" id="fiord.c1.s37">Erica most strictly obeyed their wish that she should not talk about the spirits of the region with Orga and Frolich; but the girls found plenty of people to tell them what they could not learn from Erica.</s> <s sid="38" id="fiord.c1.s38">Besides what everybody knows who lives in the rural districts of Norway--about Nipen, the spirit that is always so busy after everybody's affairs--about the Water-Sprite, an acquaintance of every one who lives beside a river or lake--and about the Mountain-Demon, familiar to all who lived so near Sulitelma; besides these common spirits, the girls used to hear of a multitude of others from old Peder, the blind houseman, and from all the farm-people, down to Oddo, the herd-boy.</s> <s sid="39" id="fiord.c1.s39">Their parents hoped that this taste of theirs might die away if once Erica, with her sad, serious face and subdued voice, were removed to a house of her own, where they would see her supported by her husband's unfearing mind, and occupied with domestic business more entirely than in her mistress's house.</s> <s sid="40" id="fiord.c1.s40">So Madame Erlingsen was well pleased that Erica was betrothed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="fiord.c1.p8"><s sid="41" id="fiord.c1.s41">For this marrying, however, the young people must wait.</s> <s sid="42" id="fiord.c1.s42">There was no house, or houseman's place, vacant for them at present.</s> <s sid="43" id="fiord.c1.s43">The old houseman Peder, who had served Erlingsen's father and Erlingsen himself for fifty-eight years, could now no longer do the weekly work on the farm which was his rent for his house, field, and cow.</s> <s sid="44" id="fiord.c1.s44">He was blind and old.</s> <s sid="45" id="fiord.c1.s45">His aged wife Ulla could not leave the house; and it was the most she could do to keep the dwelling in order, with occasional help from one and another.</s> <s sid="46" id="fiord.c1.s46">Houseman who make this sort of contract with farmers in Norway are never turned out.</s> <s sid="47" id="fiord.c1.s47">They have their dwelling and field for their own life and that of their wives.</s> <s sid="48" id="fiord.c1.s48">What they do, when disabled, is to take in a deserving young man to do their work for the farmer, on the understanding that he succeeds to the houseman's place on the death of the old people.</s> <s sid="49" id="fiord.c1.s49">Peder and Ulla had made this agreement with Erica's lover, Rolf; and it was understood that his marriage with Erica should take place whenever the old people should die.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="fiord.c1.p9"><s sid="50" id="fiord.c1.s50">It was impossible for Erica herself to fear that Nipen was offended, at the outset of this festival day.</s> <s sid="51" id="fiord.c1.s51">If he had chosen to send a wind, the guests could not have come; for no human frame can endure travelling in a wind in Nordland on a January day.</s> <s sid="52" id="fiord.c1.s52">Happily, the air was so calm that a flake of snow, or a lock of eider-down, would have fallen straight to the ground.</s> <s sid="53" id="fiord.c1.s53">At two o'clock, when the short daylight was gone, the stars were shining so brightly, that the company who came by the fiord would be sure to have an easy voyage.</s> <s sid="54" id="fiord.c1.s54">Erlingsen and some of his servants went out to the porch, on hearing music from the water, and stood with lighted pine-torches to receive their guests when, approaching from behind, they heard the sound of the sleigh-bells, and found that company was arriving both by sea and land.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="fiord.c1.p10"><s sid="55" id="fiord.c1.s55">Glad had the visitors been, whether they came by land or water, to arrive in sight of the lighted dwelling, whose windows looked like rows of yellow stars, contrasting with the blue ones overhead; and more glad still were they to be ushered into the great room, where all was so light, so warm, so cheerful.</s> <s sid="56" id="fiord.c1.s56">Warm it was to the farthest corner; and too warm near the roaring and crackling fires, for the fires were of pine wood.</s> <s sid="57" id="fiord.c1.s57">Rows upon rows of candles were fastened against the walls above the heads of the company: the floor was strewn with juniper twigs, and the spinning-wheels, the carding-boards, every token of household labour was removed except a loom, which remained in one corner.</s> <s sid="58" id="fiord.c1.s58">In another corner was a welcome sight, a platform of rough boards two feet from the floor, and on it two stools.</s> <s sid="59" id="fiord.c1.s59">This was a token that there was to be dancing; and indeed, Oddo, the herd-boy, old Peder's grandson, was seen to have his clarionet in his belt, as he ran in and out on the arrival of fresh parties.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="fiord.c1.p11"><s sid="60" id="fiord.c1.s60">[Illustration:</s> <s sid="61" id="fiord.c1.s61">In the porch she found Oddo.]</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="fiord.c1.p12"><s sid="62" id="fiord.c1.s62">The whole company walked about the large room, sipping their strong coffee, and helping one another to the good things on the trays which were carried round.</s> <s sid="63" id="fiord.c1.s63">When these trays disappeared, Oddo was seen to reach the platform with a hop, skip, and jump, followed by a dull-looking young man with a violin.</s> <s sid="64" id="fiord.c1.s64">The oldest men lighted their pipes, and sat down to talk, two or three together.</s> <s sid="65" id="fiord.c1.s65">Others withdrew to a smaller room, where card-tables were sets out, while the younger men selected their partners.</s> <s sid="66" id="fiord.c1.s66">The dance was led by the blushing Erica, whose master was her partner.</s> <s sid="67" id="fiord.c1.s67">It had never occurred to her that she was not to take her usual place; and she was greatly embarrassed, not the less so that she knew that her mistress was immediately behind, with Rolf for her partner.</s> <s sid="68" id="fiord.c1.s68">All the women in Norway dance well, being practised in it from their infancy.</s> <s sid="69" id="fiord.c1.s69">Every woman present danced well; but none better than Erica.</s> </p>

<p pid="656" id="fiord.c1.p656"><s sid="1891" id="fiord.c1.s1891">At the bishop's question about who would go down the mountain for news, each of Hund's guards begged to be the man.</s> <s sid="1892" id="fiord.c1.s1892">The swiftest of foot was chosen, and off he went--not without a barley-cake and brandy-flask--at a pace which promised speedy tidings.</s> </p>

<p pid="657" id="fiord.c1.p657"><s sid="1893" id="fiord.c1.s1893">As Madame Erlingsen hoped in her heart, he met a messenger despatched by her husband; so that all who had lain down to sleep--all but herself, that is--were greeted by good news as they appeared at the breakfast-table.</s> <s sid="1894" id="fiord.c1.s1894">The pirates were all taken, and on their way, bound, to Saltdalen, there to be examined by the magistrate, and, no doubt, thence transferred to the jail at Tronyem.</s> <s sid="1895" id="fiord.c1.s1895">Hund was to follow immediately, either to take his trial with them, or to appear as evidence against them.</s> </p>

<p pid="658" id="fiord.c1.p658"><s sid="1896" id="fiord.c1.s1896">One of the pirates was wounded, and two of the country people, but not a life was lost; and Erlingsen, Rolf, Peder, and Oddo were all safe and unhurt.</s> </p>

<p pid="659" id="fiord.c1.p659"><s sid="1897" id="fiord.c1.s1897">Oddo was superintending the unlading of the schooner, and was appointed by the magistrate, at his master's desire, head guard of the property, as it lay on the beach, till the necessary evidence of its having been stolen by the pirates was taken, and the owners could be permitted to identify and resume their property.</s> <s sid="1898" id="fiord.c1.s1898">Oddo was certainly the greatest man concerned in the affair, after Erlingsen.</s> <s sid="1899" id="fiord.c1.s1899">When it was finished, and he returned to his home, he found he cared more for the pressure of his grandfather's hand upon his head, as the old man blessed his boy, than for all the praises of the whole country round.</s> </p>

<p pid="660" id="fiord.c1.p660"><s sid="1900" id="fiord.c1.s1900">An idea occurred to everybody but one, within the next few hours, which occasioned some consultation.</s> <s sid="1901" id="fiord.c1.s1901">Everybody but Erica felt and said that it would be a great honour and privilege, but one not undeserved by the district, for the Bishop of Tronyem to marry Rolf and Erica before he left Nordland.</s> <s sid="1902" id="fiord.c1.s1902">The bishop wished to make some acknowledgment for the zealous protection and hospitality which had been afforded him; and he soon found that no act would be so generally acceptable as his blessing the union of these young people.</s> <s sid="1903" id="fiord.c1.s1903">He spoke to Madame Erlingsen about it, and her only doubt was whether it was not too soon after the burial of old Ulla.</s> <s sid="1904" id="fiord.c1.s1904">If Peder, however, should not object on this ground, no one else had a right to do so.</s> </p>

<p pid="664" id="fiord.c1.p664"><s sid="1918" id="fiord.c1.s1918">The summons arrived quite as soon as it could have been looked for, and the next day there was as pretty a boat-procession on the still waters of the fiord as had ever before glided over its surface.</s> <s sid="1919" id="fiord.c1.s1919">Within the memory of man, no bride had been prettier--no crown more glittering--no bridegroom more happy--no chanting was ever more soothing than old Peder's--no clarionet better played than Oddo's--no bridesmaids more gay and kindly than Orga and Frolich.</s> <s sid="1920" id="fiord.c1.s1920">The neighbours were hearty in their cheers as the boats put off and the cheers were repeated from every settlement in the coves and on the heights of the fiord, and were again taken up by the echoes till the summer air seemed to be full of gladness.</s> </p>

<p pid="665" id="fiord.c1.p665"><s sid="1921" id="fiord.c1.s1921">To conclude, the bishop was punctual, and kindly in his welcome of Erica to the altar.</s> <s sid="1922" id="fiord.c1.s1922">He was also graciously pleased with Rolf's explanation that he had not ventured to bring a gift for so great a dignitary, but that he hoped the bishop would approve of his giving his humble offering to the church instead.</s> <s sid="1923" id="fiord.c1.s1923">The six sides of the new pulpit were nearly finished now, and Rolf desired to take upon himself the carving of the basement as his marriage-fee.</s> <s sid="1924" id="fiord.c1.s1924">As the bishop smiled approbation, M.
