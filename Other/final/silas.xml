<qe/><title>PART 1. CHAPTER I.</title>
<p pid="1" id="silas.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c1.s1">In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses--and even great ladies, clothed in silk and thread-lace, had their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak--there might be seen in districts far away among the lanes, or deep in the bosom of the hills, certain pallid undersized men, who, by the side of the brawny country-folk, looked like the remnants of a disinherited race.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c1.s2">The shepherd's dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag?--and these pale men rarely stirred abroad without that mysterious burden.</s> <s sid="3" id="silas.c1.s3">The shepherd himself, though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but flaxen thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that thread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving, indispensable though it was, could be carried on entirely without the help of the Evil One.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c1.s4">In that far-off time superstition clung easily round every person or thing that was at all unwonted, or even intermittent and occasional merely, like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c1.s5">No one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin; and how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who knew his father and mother?</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c1.s6">To the peasants of old times, the world outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and mystery: to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back with the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts, hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust, which would have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on his part had ended in the commission of a crime; especially if he had any reputation for knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c1.s7">All cleverness, whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the tongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in itself suspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible manner, were mostly not overwise or clever--at least, not beyond such a matter as knowing the signs of the weather; and the process by which rapidity and dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they partook of the nature of conjuring.</s> <s sid="8" id="silas.c1.s8">In this way it came to pass that those scattered linen-weavers--emigrants from the town into the country--were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours, and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of loneliness.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="silas.c1.s9">In the early years of this century, such a linen-weaver, named Silas Marner, worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the nutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe, and not far from the edge of a deserted stone-pit.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c1.s10">The questionable sound of Silas's loom, so unlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine, or the simpler rhythm of the flail, had a half-fearful fascination for the Raveloe boys, who would often leave off their nutting or birds'-nesting to peep in at the window of the stone cottage, counterbalancing a certain awe at the mysterious action of the loom, by a pleasant sense of scornful superiority, drawn from the mockery of its alternating noises, along with the bent, tread-mill attitude of the weaver.</s> <s sid="11" id="silas.c1.s11">But sometimes it happened that Marner, pausing to adjust an irregularity in his thread, became aware of the small scoundrels, and, though chary of his time, he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from his loom, and, opening the door, would fix on them a gaze that was always enough to make them take to their legs in terror.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c1.s12">For how was it possible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in Silas Marner's pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not close to them, and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart cramp, or rickets, or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the rear?</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c1.s13">They had, perhaps, heard their fathers and mothers hint that Silas Marner could cure folks' rheumatism if he had a mind, and add, still more darkly, that if you could only speak the devil fair enough, he might save you the cost of the doctor.</s> <s sid="14" id="silas.c1.s14">Such strange lingering echoes of the old demon-worship might perhaps even now be caught by the diligent listener among the grey-haired peasantry; for the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity.</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c1.s15">A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm, is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants, and to whom a life of hard toil has never been illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith.</s> <s sid="16" id="silas.c1.s16">To them pain and mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and enjoyment: their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed desire and hope, but is all overgrown by recollections that are a perpetual pasture to fear.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c1.s17"><qs/>"Is there anything you can fancy that you would like to eat?"<qe/></s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c1.s18">I once said to an old labouring man, who was in his last illness, and who had refused all the food his wife had offered him.</s> <s sid="19" id="silas.c1.s19"><qs/>"No,"<qe/><sss/> he answered, <sse/><qs/>"I've never been used to nothing but common victual, and I can't eat that."<qe/></s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c1.s20">Experience had bred no fancies in him that could raise the phantasm of appetite.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c1.p3"><s sid="21" id="silas.c1.s21">And Raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered, undrowned by new voices.</s> <s sid="22" id="silas.c1.s22">Not that it was one of those barren parishes lying on the outskirts of civilization--inhabited by meagre sheep and thinly-scattered shepherds: on the contrary, it lay in the rich central plain of what we are pleased to call Merry England, and held farms which, speaking from a spiritual point of view, paid highly-desirable tithes.</s> <s sid="23" id="silas.c1.s23">But it was nestled in a snug well-wooded hollow, quite an hour's journey on horseback from any turnpike, where it was never reached by the vibrations of the coach-horn, or of public opinion.</s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c1.s24">It was an important-looking village, with a fine old church and large churchyard in the heart of it, and two or three large brick-and-stone homesteads, with well-walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks, standing close upon the road, and lifting more imposing fronts than the rectory, which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the churchyard:--a village which showed at once the summits of its social life, and told the practised eye that there was no great park and manor-house in the vicinity, but that there were several chiefs in Raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease, drawing enough money from their bad farming, in those war times, to live in a rollicking fashion, and keep a jolly Christmas, Whitsun, and Easter tide.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="silas.c1.s25">It was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe; he was then simply a pallid young man, with prominent short-sighted brown eyes, whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of average culture and experience, but for the villagers near whom he had come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with the exceptional nature of his occupation, and his advent from an unknown region called "North'ard".</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c1.s26">So had his way of life:--he invited no comer to step across his door-sill, and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint at the Rainbow, or to gossip at the wheelwright's: he sought no man or woman, save for the purposes of his calling, or in order to supply himself with necessaries; and it was soon clear to the Raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them to accept him against her will--quite as if he had heard them declare that they would never marry a dead man come to life again.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c1.s27">This view of Marner's personality was not without another ground than his pale face and unexampled eyes; for Jem Rodney, the mole-catcher, averred that one evening as he was returning homeward, he saw Silas Marner leaning against a stile with a heavy bag on his back, instead of resting the bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done; and that, on coming up to him, he saw that Marner's eyes were set like a dead man's, and he spoke to him, and shook him, and his limbs were stiff, and his hands clutched the bag as if they'd been made of iron; but just as he had made up his mind that the weaver was dead, he came all right again, like, as you might say, in the winking of an eye, and said "Good-night", and walked off.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c1.s28">All this Jem swore he had seen, more by token that it was the very day he had been mole-catching on Squire Cass's land, down by the old saw-pit.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c1.s29">Some said Marner must have been in a "fit", a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible; but the argumentative Mr. Macey, clerk of the parish, shook his head, and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall down.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c1.s30">A fit was a stroke, wasn't it?  and it was in the nature of a stroke to partly take away the use of a man's limbs and throw him on the parish, if he'd got no children to look to.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c1.s31">No, no; it was no stroke that would let a man stand on his legs, like a horse between the shafts, and then walk off as soon as you can say <qs/>"Gee!"<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c1.s32">But there might be such a thing as a man's soul being loose from his body, and going out and in, like a bird out of its nest and back; and that was how folks got over-wise, for they went to school in this shell-less state to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn with their five senses and the parson.</s> <s sid="33" id="silas.c1.s33">And where did Master Marner get his knowledge of herbs from--and charms too, if he liked to give them away?</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c1.s34">Jem Rodney's story was no more than what might have been expected by anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates, and made her sleep like a baby, when her heart had been beating enough to burst her body, for two months and more, while she had been under the doctor's care.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c1.s35">He might cure more folks if he would; but he was worth speaking fair, if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c1.p5"><s sid="36" id="silas.c1.s36">It was partly to this vague fear that Marner was indebted for protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have drawn upon him, but still more to the fact that, the old linen-weaver in the neighbouring parish of Tarley being dead, his handicraft made him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district, and even to the more provident cottagers, who had their little stock of yarn at the year's end.</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c1.s37">Their sense of his usefulness would have counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them.</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c1.s38">And the years had rolled on without producing any change in the impressions of the neighbours concerning Marner, except the change from novelty to habit.</s> <s sid="39" id="silas.c1.s39">At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just the same things about Silas Marner as at the beginning: they did not say them quite so often, but they believed them much more strongly when they did say them.</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c1.s40">There was only one important addition which the years had brought: it was, that Master Marner had laid by a fine sight of money somewhere, and that he could buy up "bigger men" than himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c1.p6"><s sid="41" id="silas.c1.s41">But while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary, and his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, Marner's inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every fervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c1.s42">His life, before he came to Raveloe, had been filled with the movement, the mental activity, and the close fellowship, which, in that day as in this, marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow religious sect, where the poorest layman has the chance of distinguishing himself by gifts of speech, and has, at the very least, the weight of a silent voter in the government of his community.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c1.s43">Marner was highly thought of in that little hidden world, known to itself as the church assembling in Lantern Yard; he was believed to be a young man of exemplary life and ardent faith; and a peculiar interest had been centred in him ever since he had fallen, at a prayer-meeting, into a mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness, which, lasting for an hour or more, had been mistaken for death.</s> <s sid="44" id="silas.c1.s44">To have sought a medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas himself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful self-exclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein.</s> <s sid="45" id="silas.c1.s45">Silas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline; and though the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the absence, on his part, of any spiritual vision during his outward trance, yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was seen in an accession of light and fervour.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c1.s46">A less truthful man than he might have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the form of resurgent memory; a less sane man might have believed in such a creation; but Silas was both sane and honest, though, as with many honest and fervent men, culture had not defined any channels for his sense of mystery, and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of inquiry and knowledge.</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c1.s47">He had inherited from his mother some acquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparation--a little store of wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequest--but of late years he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this knowledge, believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer, and that prayer might suffice without herbs; so that the inherited delight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and dandelion and coltsfoot, began to wear to him the character of a temptation.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c1.p7"><s sid="48" id="silas.c1.s48">Among the members of his church there was one young man, a little older than himself, with whom he had long lived in such close friendship that it was the custom of their Lantern Yard brethren to call them David and Jonathan.</s> <s sid="49" id="silas.c1.s49">The real name of the friend was William Dane, and he, too, was regarded as a shining instance of youthful piety, though somewhat given to over-severity towards weaker brethren, and to be so dazzled by his own light as to hold himself wiser than his teachers.</s> <s sid="50" id="silas.c1.s50">But whatever blemishes others might discern in William, to his friend's mind he was faultless; for Marner had one of those impressible self-doubting natures which, at an inexperienced age, admire imperativeness and lean on contradiction.</s> <s sid="51" id="silas.c1.s51">The expression of trusting simplicity in Marner's face, heightened by that absence of special observation, that defenceless, deer-like gaze which belongs to large prominent eyes, was strongly contrasted by the self-complacent suppression of inward triumph that lurked in the narrow slanting eyes and compressed lips of William Dane.</s> <s sid="52" id="silas.c1.s52">One of the most frequent topics of conversation between the two friends was Assurance of salvation:</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c1.s53">Silas confessed that he could never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear, and listened with longing wonder when William declared that he had possessed unshaken assurance ever since, in the period of his conversion, he had dreamed that he saw the words "calling and election sure" standing by themselves on a white page in the open Bible.</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c1.s54">Such colloquies have occupied many a pair of pale-faced weavers, whose unnurtured souls have been like young winged things, fluttering forsaken in the twilight.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="silas.c1.s55">It had seemed to the unsuspecting Silas that the friendship had suffered no chill even from his formation of another attachment of a closer kind.</s> <s sid="56" id="silas.c1.s56">For some months he had been engaged to a young servant-woman, waiting only for a little increase to their mutual savings in order to their marriage; and it was a great delight to him that Sarah did not object to William's occasional presence in their Sunday interviews.</s> <s sid="57" id="silas.c1.s57">It was at this point in their history that Silas's cataleptic fit occurred during the prayer-meeting; and amidst the various queries and expressions of interest addressed to him by his fellow-members, William's suggestion alone jarred with the general sympathy towards a brother thus singled out for special dealings.</s> <s sid="58" id="silas.c1.s58">He observed that, to him, this trance looked more like a visitation of Satan than a proof of divine favour, and exhorted his friend to see that he hid no accursed thing within his soul.</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c1.s59">Silas, feeling bound to accept rebuke and admonition as a brotherly office, felt no resentment, but only pain, at his friend's doubts concerning him; and to this was soon added some anxiety at the perception that Sarah's manner towards him began to exhibit a strange fluctuation between an effort at an increased manifestation of regard and involuntary signs of shrinking and dislike.</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c1.s60">He asked her if she wished to break off their engagement; but she denied this: their engagement was known to the church, and had been recognized in the prayer-meetings; it could not be broken off without strict investigation, and Sarah could render no reason that would be sanctioned by the feeling of the community.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c1.s61">At this time the senior deacon was taken dangerously ill, and, being a childless widower, he was tended night and day by some of the younger brethren or sisters.</s> <s sid="62" id="silas.c1.s62">Silas frequently took his turn in the night-watching with William, the one relieving the other at two in the morning.</s> <s sid="63" id="silas.c1.s63">The old man, contrary to expectation, seemed to be on the way to recovery, when one night Silas, sitting up by his bedside, observed that his usual audible breathing had ceased.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c1.s64">The candle was burning low, and he had to lift it to see the patient's face distinctly.</s> <s sid="65" id="silas.c1.s65">Examination convinced him that the deacon was dead--had been dead some time, for the limbs were rigid.</s> <s sid="66" id="silas.c1.s66">Silas asked himself if he had been asleep, and looked at the clock: it was already four in the morning.</s> <s sid="67" id="silas.c1.s67">How was it that William had not come?</s> <s sid="68" id="silas.c1.s68">In much anxiety he went to seek for help, and soon there were several friends assembled in the house, the minister among them, while Silas went away to his work, wishing he could have met William to know the reason of his non-appearance.</s> <s sid="69" id="silas.c1.s69">But at six o'clock, as he was thinking of going to seek his friend, William came, and with him the minister.</s> <s sid="70" id="silas.c1.s70">They came to summon him to Lantern Yard, to meet the church members there; and to his inquiry concerning the cause of the summons the only reply was, <qs/>"You will hear."<qe/></s> <s sid="71" id="silas.c1.s71">Nothing further was said until Silas was seated in the vestry, in front of the minister, with the eyes of those who to him represented God's people fixed solemnly upon him.</s> <s sid="72" id="silas.c1.s72">Then the minister, taking out a pocket-knife, showed it to Silas, and asked him if he knew where he had left that knife?</s> <s sid="73" id="silas.c1.s73">Silas said, he did not know that he had left it anywhere out of his own pocket--but he was trembling at this strange interrogation.</s> <s sid="74" id="silas.c1.s74">He was then exhorted not to hide his sin, but to confess and repent.</s> <s sid="75" id="silas.c1.s75">The knife had been found in the bureau by the departed deacon's bedside--found in the place where the little bag of church money had lain, which the minister himself had seen the day before.</s> <s sid="76" id="silas.c1.s76">Some hand had removed that bag; and whose hand could it be, if not that of the man to whom the knife belonged?</s> <s sid="77" id="silas.c1.s77">For some time Silas was mute with astonishment: then he said, <qs/>"God will clear me:</s> <s sid="78" id="silas.c1.s78">I know nothing about the knife being there, or the money being gone.</s> <s sid="79" id="silas.c1.s79">Search me and my dwelling; you will find nothing but three pound five of my own savings, which William Dane knows I have had these six months."<qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="silas.c1.s80">At this William groaned, but the minister said, <qs/>"The proof is heavy against you, brother Marner.</s> <s sid="81" id="silas.c1.s81">The money was taken in the night last past, and no man was with our departed brother but you, for William Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness from going to take his place as usual, and you yourself said that he had not come; and, moreover, you neglected the dead body."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="silas.c1.s82"><qs/>"I must have slept,"<qe/> said Silas.</s> <s sid="83" id="silas.c1.s83">Then, after a pause, he added, <qs/>"Or I must have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me under, so that the thief must have come and gone while I was not in the body, but out of the body.</s> <s sid="84" id="silas.c1.s84">But, I say again, search me and my dwelling, for I have been nowhere else."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="silas.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="silas.c1.s85">The search was made, and it ended--in William Dane's finding the well-known bag, empty, tucked behind the chest of drawers in Silas's chamber!</s> <s sid="86" id="silas.c1.s86">On this William exhorted his friend to confess, and not to hide his sin any longer.</s> <s sid="87" id="silas.c1.s87">Silas turned a look of keen reproach on him, and said, <qs/>"William, for nine years that we have gone in and out together, have you ever known me tell a lie?</s> <s sid="88" id="silas.c1.s88">But God will clear me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="silas.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="silas.c1.s89"><qs/>"Brother,"<qe/><sss/> said William, <sse/><qs/>"how do I know what you may have done in the secret chambers of your heart, to give Satan an advantage over you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="silas.c1.p12"><s sid="90" id="silas.c1.s90">Silas was still looking at his friend.</s> <s sid="91" id="silas.c1.s91">Suddenly a deep flush came over his face, and he was about to speak impetuously, when he seemed checked again by some inward shock, that sent the flush back and made him tremble.</s> <s sid="92" id="silas.c1.s92">But at last he spoke feebly, looking at William.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="silas.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="silas.c1.s93"><qs/>"I remember now--the knife wasn't in my pocket."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="silas.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="silas.c1.s94">William said, <qs/>"I know nothing of what you mean."<qe/></s> <s sid="95" id="silas.c1.s95">The other persons present, however, began to inquire where Silas meant to say that the knife was, but he would give no further explanation: he only said, <qs/>"I am sore stricken; I can say nothing.</s> <s sid="96" id="silas.c1.s96">God will clear me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="silas.c1.p15"><s sid="97" id="silas.c1.s97">On their return to the vestry there was further deliberation.</s> <s sid="98" id="silas.c1.s98">Any resort to legal measures for ascertaining the culprit was contrary to the principles of the church in Lantern Yard, according to which prosecution was forbidden to Christians, even had the case held less scandal to the community.</s> <s sid="99" id="silas.c1.s99">But the members were bound to take other measures for finding out the truth, and they resolved on praying and drawing lots.</s> <s sid="100" id="silas.c1.s100">This resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those who are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on in the alleys of our towns.</s> <s sid="101" id="silas.c1.s101">Silas knelt with his brethren, relying on his own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference, but feeling that there was sorrow and mourning behind for him even then--that his trust in man had been cruelly bruised.</s> <s sid="102" id="silas.c1.s102">_The lots declared that Silas Marner was guilty._  He was solemnly suspended from church-membership, and called upon to render up the stolen money: only on confession, as the sign of repentance, could he be received once more within the folds of the church.</s> <s sid="103" id="silas.c1.s103">Marner listened in silence.</s> <s sid="104" id="silas.c1.s104">At last, when everyone rose to depart, he went towards William Dane and said, in a voice shaken by agitation--</s> </p>

<qe/><title>PART 1. CHAPTER II.</title>
<p pid="1" id="silas.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c2.s1">Even people whose lives have been made various by learning, sometimes find it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life, on their faith in the Invisible, nay, on the sense that their past joys and sorrows are a real experience, when they are suddenly transported to a new land, where the beings around them know nothing of their history, and share none of their ideas--where their mother earth shows another lap, and human life has other forms than those on which their souls have been nourished.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c2.s2">Minds that have been unhinged from their old faith and love, have perhaps sought this Lethean influence of exile, in which the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished, and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories.</s> <s sid="3" id="silas.c2.s3">But even _their_ experience may hardly enable them thoroughly to imagine what was the effect on a simple weaver like Silas Marner, when he left his own country and people and came to settle in Raveloe.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c2.s4">Nothing could be more unlike his native town, set within sight of the widespread hillsides, than this low, wooded region, where he felt hidden even from the heavens by the screening trees and hedgerows.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c2.s5">There was nothing here, when he rose in the deep morning quiet and looked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass, that seemed to have any relation with that life centring in Lantern Yard, which had once been to him the altar-place of high dispensations.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c2.s6">The whitewashed walls; the little pews where well-known figures entered with a subdued rustling, and where first one well-known voice and then another, pitched in a peculiar key of petition, uttered phrases at once occult and familiar, like the amulet worn on the heart; the pulpit where the minister delivered unquestioned doctrine, and swayed to and fro, and handled the book in a long accustomed manner; the very pauses between the couplets of the hymn, as it was given out, and the recurrent swell of voices in song: these things had been the channel of divine influences to Marner--they were the fostering home of his religious emotions--they were Christianity and God's kingdom upon earth.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c2.s7">A weaver who finds hard words in his hymn-book knows nothing of abstractions; as the little child knows nothing of parental love, but only knows one face and one lap towards which it stretches its arms for refuge and nurture.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c2.p2"><s sid="8" id="silas.c2.s8">And what could be more unlike that Lantern Yard world than the world in Raveloe?--orchards looking lazy with neglected plenty; the large church in the wide churchyard, which men gazed at lounging at their own doors in service-time; the purple-faced farmers jogging along the lanes or turning in at the Rainbow; homesteads, where men supped heavily and slept in the light of the evening hearth, and where women seemed to be laying up a stock of linen for the life to come.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c2.s9">There were no lips in Raveloe from which a word could fall that would stir Silas Marner's benumbed faith to a sense of pain.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c2.s10">In the early ages of the world, we know, it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by its own divinities, so that a man could cross the bordering heights and be out of the reach of his native gods, whose presence was confined to the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from his birth.</s> <s sid="11" id="silas.c2.s11">And poor Silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike the feeling of primitive men, when they fled thus, in fear or in sullenness, from the face of an unpropitious deity.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c2.s12">It seemed to him that the Power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the prayer-meetings, was very far away from this land in which he had taken refuge, where men lived in careless abundance, knowing and needing nothing of that trust, which, for him, had been turned to bitterness.</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c2.s13">The little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly, that frustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the blackness of night.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c2.p3"><s sid="14" id="silas.c2.s14">His first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom; and he went on with this unremittingly, never asking himself why, now he was come to Raveloe, he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of Mrs. Osgood's table-linen sooner than she expected--without contemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the work.</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c2.s15">He seemed to weave, like the spider, from pure impulse, without reflection.</s> <s sid="16" id="silas.c2.s16">Every man's work, pursued steadily, tends in this way to become an end in itself, and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of his life.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c2.s17">Silas's hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle, and his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves under his effort.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c2.s18">Then there were the calls of hunger; and Silas, in his solitude, had to provide his own breakfast, dinner, and supper, to fetch his own water from the well, and put his own kettle on the fire; and all these immediate promptings helped, along with the weaving, to reduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect.</s> <s sid="19" id="silas.c2.s19">He hated the thought of the past; there was nothing that called out his love and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst; and the future was all dark, for there was no Unseen Love that cared for him.</s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c2.s20">Thought was arrested by utter bewilderment, now its old narrow pathway was closed, and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had fallen on its keenest nerves.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c2.p4"><s sid="21" id="silas.c2.s21">But at last Mrs. Osgood's table-linen was finished, and Silas was paid in gold.</s> <s sid="22" id="silas.c2.s22">His earnings in his native town, where he worked for a wholesale dealer, had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly, and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of piety and charity.</s> <s sid="23" id="silas.c2.s23">Now, for the first time in his life, he had five bright guineas put into his hand; no man expected a share of them, and he loved no man that he should offer him a share.</s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c2.s24">But what were the guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving?</s> <s sid="25" id="silas.c2.s25">It was needless for him to ask that, for it was pleasant to him to feel them in his palm, and look at their bright faces, which were all his own: it was another element of life, like the weaving and the satisfaction of hunger, subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief and love from which he had been cut off.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c2.s26">The weaver's hand had known the touch of hard-won money even before the palm had grown to its full breadth; for twenty years, mysterious money had stood to him as the symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c2.s27">He had seemed to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for him; for he loved the _purpose_ then.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c2.s28">But now, when all purpose was gone, that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the seeds of desire; and as Silas walked homeward across the fields in the twilight, he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the gathering gloom.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c2.p5"><s sid="29" id="silas.c2.s29">About this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility of some fellowship with his neighbours.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c2.s30">One day, taking a pair of shoes to be mended, he saw the cobbler's wife seated by the fire, suffering from the terrible symptoms of heart-disease and dropsy, which he had witnessed as the precursors of his mother's death.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c2.s31">He felt a rush of pity at the mingled sight and remembrance, and, recalling the relief his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove, he promised Sally Oates to bring her something that would ease her, since the doctor did her no good.</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c2.s32">In this office of charity, Silas felt, for the first time since he had come to Raveloe, a sense of unity between his past and present life, which might have been the beginning of his rescue from the insect-like existence into which his nature had shrunk.</s> <s sid="33" id="silas.c2.s33">But Sally Oates's disease had raised her into a personage of much interest and importance among the neighbours, and the fact of her having found relief from drinking Silas Marner's "stuff" became a matter of general discourse.</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c2.s34">When Doctor Kimble gave physic, it was natural that it should have an effect; but when a weaver, who came from nobody knew where, worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters, the occult character of the process was evident.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c2.s35">Such a sort of thing had not been known since the Wise Woman at Tarley died; and she had charms as well as "stuff": everybody went to her when their children had fits.</s> <s sid="36" id="silas.c2.s36">Silas Marner must be a person of the same sort, for how did he know what would bring back Sally Oates's breath, if he didn't know a fine sight more than that?</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c2.s37">The Wise Woman had words that she muttered to herself, so that you couldn't hear what they were, and if she tied a bit of red thread round the child's toe the while, it would keep off the water in the head.</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c2.s38">There were women in Raveloe, at that present time, who had worn one of the Wise Woman's little bags round their necks, and, in consequence, had never had an idiot child, as Ann Coulter had.</s> <s sid="39" id="silas.c2.s39">Silas Marner could very likely do as much, and more; and now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts, and be so "comical-looking".</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c2.s40">But Sally Oates must mind and not tell the doctor, for he would be sure to set his face against Marner: he was always angry about the Wise Woman, and used to threaten those who went to her that they should have none of his help any more.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c2.p6"><s sid="41" id="silas.c2.s41">Silas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who wanted him to charm away the whooping-cough, or bring back the milk, and by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the hands; and, to secure themselves against a refusal, the applicants brought silver in their palms.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c2.s42">Silas might have driven a profitable trade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs; but money on this condition was no temptation to him: he had never known an impulse towards falsity, and he drove one after another away with growing irritation, for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to Tarley, and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the sake of asking his aid.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c2.s43">But the hope in his wisdom was at length changed into dread, for no one believed him when he said he knew no charms and could work no cures, and every man and woman who had an accident or a new attack after applying to him, set the misfortune down to Master Marner's ill-will and irritated glances.</s> <s sid="44" id="silas.c2.s44">Thus it came to pass that his movement of pity towards Sally Oates, which had given him a transient sense of brotherhood, heightened the repulsion between him and his neighbours, and made his isolation more complete.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="silas.c2.s45">Gradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap, and Marner drew less and less for his own wants, trying to solve the problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on as small an outlay as possible.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c2.s46">Have not men, shut up in solitary imprisonment, found an interest in marking the moments by straight strokes of a certain length on the wall, until the growth of the sum of straight strokes, arranged in triangles, has become a mastering purpose?</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c2.s47">Do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by repeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition has bred a want, which is incipient habit?</s> <s sid="48" id="silas.c2.s48">That will help us to understand how the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose imaginations, even in the very beginning of their hoard, showed them no purpose beyond it.</s> <s sid="49" id="silas.c2.s49">Marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a square, and then into a larger square; and every added guinea, while it was itself a satisfaction, bred a new desire.</s> <s sid="50" id="silas.c2.s50">In this strange world, made a hopeless riddle to him, he might, if he had had a less intense nature, have sat weaving, weaving--looking towards the end of his pattern, or towards the end of his web, till he forgot the riddle, and everything else but his immediate sensations; but the money had come to mark off his weaving into periods, and the money not only grew, but it remained with him.</s> <s sid="51" id="silas.c2.s51">He began to think it was conscious of him, as his loom was, and he would on no account have exchanged those coins, which had become his familiars, for other coins with unknown faces.</s> <s sid="52" id="silas.c2.s52">He handled them, he counted them, till their form and colour were like the satisfaction of a thirst to him; but it was only in the night, when his work was done, that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship.</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c2.s53">He had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom, and here he had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas and silver coins, covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced them.</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c2.s54">Not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or strongly to his mind: hoarding was common in country districts in those days; there were old labourers in the parish of Raveloe who were known to have their savings by them, probably inside their flock-beds; but their rustic neighbours, though not all of them as honest as their ancestors in the days of King Alfred, had not imaginations bold enough to lay a plan of burglary.</s> <s sid="55" id="silas.c2.s55">How could they have spent the money in their own village without betraying themselves?</s> <s sid="56" id="silas.c2.s56">They would be obliged to <qs/>"run away"<qe/>--a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c2.p8"><s sid="57" id="silas.c2.s57">So, year after year, Silas Marner had lived in this solitude, his guineas rising in the iron pot, and his life narrowing and hardening itself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction that had no relation to any other being.</s> <s sid="58" id="silas.c2.s58">His life had reduced itself to the functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended.</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c2.s59">The same sort of process has perhaps been undergone by wiser men, when they have been cut off from faith and love--only, instead of a loom and a heap of guineas, they have had some erudite research, some ingenious project, or some well-knit theory.</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c2.s60">Strangely Marner's face and figure shrank and bent themselves into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life, so that he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube, which has no meaning standing apart.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c2.s61">The prominent eyes that used to look trusting and dreamy, now looked as if they had been made to see only one kind of thing that was very small, like tiny grain, for which they hunted everywhere: and he was so withered and yellow, that, though he was not yet forty, the children always called him "Old Master Marner".</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c2.p9"><s sid="62" id="silas.c2.s62">Yet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened, which showed that the sap of affection was not all gone.</s> <s sid="63" id="silas.c2.s63">It was one of his daily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off, and for this purpose, ever since he came to Raveloe, he had had a brown earthenware pot, which he held as his most precious utensil among the very few conveniences he had granted himself.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c2.s64">It had been his companion for twelve years, always standing on the same spot, always lending its handle to him in the early morning, so that its form had an expression for him of willing helpfulness, and the impress of its handle on his palm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear water.</s> <s sid="65" id="silas.c2.s65">One day as he was returning from the well, he stumbled against the step of the stile, and his brown pot, falling with force against the stones that overarched the ditch below him, was broken in three pieces.</s> <s sid="66" id="silas.c2.s66">Silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in his heart.</s> <s sid="67" id="silas.c2.s67">The brown pot could never be of use to him any more, but he stuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a memorial.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="silas.c2.p10"><s sid="68" id="silas.c2.s68">This is the history of Silas Marner, until the fifteenth year after he came to Raveloe.</s> <s sid="69" id="silas.c2.s69">The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled with its monotony, his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of sameness in the brownish web, his muscles moving with such even repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the holding of his breath.</s> <s sid="70" id="silas.c2.s70">But at night came his revelry: at night he closed his shutters, and made fast his doors, and drew forth his gold.</s> <s sid="71" id="silas.c2.s71">Long ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to hold them, and he had made for them two thick leather bags, which wasted no room in their resting-place, but lent themselves flexibly to every corner.</s> <s sid="72" id="silas.c2.s72">How the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the dark leather mouths!</s> <s sid="73" id="silas.c2.s73">The silver bore no large proportion in amount to the gold, because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work were always partly paid for in gold, and out of the silver he supplied his own bodily wants, choosing always the shillings and sixpences to spend in this way.</s> <s sid="74" id="silas.c2.s74">He loved the guineas best, but he would not change the silver--the crowns and half-crowns that were his own earnings, begotten by his labour; he loved them all.</s> <s sid="75" id="silas.c2.s75">He spread them out in heaps and bathed his hands in them; then he counted them and set them up in regular piles, and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and fingers, and thought fondly of the guineas that were only half-earned by the work in his loom, as if they had been unborn children--thought of the guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years, through all his life, which spread far away before him, the end quite hidden by countless days of weaving.</s> <s sid="76" id="silas.c2.s76">No wonder his thoughts were still with his loom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the lanes to fetch and carry home his work, so that his steps never wandered to the hedge-banks and the lane-side in search of the once familiar herbs: these too belonged to the past, from which his life had shrunk away, like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy fringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread, that cuts a groove for itself in the barren sand.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="silas.c2.p11"><s sid="77" id="silas.c2.s77">But about the Christmas of that fifteenth year, a second great change came over Marner's life, and his history became blent in a singular manner with the life of his neighbours.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="silas.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c3.s1">The greatest man in Raveloe was Squire Cass, who lived in the large red house with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high stables behind it, nearly opposite the church.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c3.s2">He was only one among several landed parishioners, but he alone was honoured with the title of Squire; for though Mr. Osgood's family was also understood to be of timeless origin--the Raveloe imagination having never ventured back to that fearful blank when there were no Osgoods--still, he merely owned the farm he occupied; whereas Squire Cass had a tenant or two, who complained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c3.p2"><s sid="3" id="silas.c3.s3">It was still that glorious war-time which was felt to be a peculiar favour of Providence towards the landed interest, and the fall of prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry were plentifully anointing their wheels.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c3.s4">I am speaking now in relation to Raveloe and the parishes that resembled it; for our old-fashioned country life had many different aspects, as all life must have when it is spread over a various surface, and breathed on variously by multitudinous currents, from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of men, which are for ever moving and crossing each other with incalculable results.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c3.s5">Raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the rutted lanes, aloof from the currents of industrial energy and Puritan earnestness: the rich ate and drank freely, accepting gout and apoplexy as things that ran mysteriously in respectable families, and the poor thought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly life; besides, their feasting caused a multiplication of orts, which were the heirlooms of the poor.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c3.s6">Betty Jay scented the boiling of Squire Cass's hams, but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in which they were boiled; and when the seasons brought round the great merry-makings, they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the poor.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c3.s7">For the Raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the barrels of ale--they were on a large scale, and lasted a good while, especially in the winter-time.</s> <s sid="8" id="silas.c3.s8">After ladies had packed up their best gowns and top-knots in bandboxes, and had incurred the risk of fording streams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather, when there was no knowing how high the water would rise, it was not to be supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c3.s9">On this ground it was always contrived in the dark seasons, when there was little work to be done, and the hours were long, that several neighbours should keep open house in succession.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c3.s10">So soon as Squire Cass's standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness, his guests had nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to Mr. Osgood's, at the Orchards, and they found hams and chines uncut, pork-pies with the scent of the fire in them, spun butter in all its freshness--everything, in fact, that appetites at leisure could desire, in perhaps greater perfection, though not in greater abundance, than at Squire Cass's.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c3.p3"><s sid="11" id="silas.c3.s11">For the Squire's wife had died long ago, and the Red House was without that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome love and fear in parlour and kitchen; and this helped to account not only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the holiday provisions, but also for the frequency with which the proud Squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the Rainbow rather than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot; perhaps, also, for the fact that his sons had turned out rather ill.  Raveloe was not a place where moral censure was severe, but it was thought a weakness in the Squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness; and though some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford it, people shook their heads at the courses of the second son, Dunstan, commonly called Dunsey Cass, whose taste for swopping and betting might turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c3.s12">To be sure, the neighbours said, it was no matter what became of Dunsey--a spiteful jeering fellow, who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other people went dry--always provided that his doings did not bring trouble on a family like Squire Cass's, with a monument in the church, and tankards older than King George.</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c3.s13">But it would be a thousand pities if Mr. Godfrey, the eldest, a fine open-faced good-natured young man who was to come into the land some day, should take to going along the same road with his brother, as he had seemed to do of late.</s> <s sid="14" id="silas.c3.s14">If he went on in that way, he would lose Miss Nancy Lammeter; for it was well known that she had looked very shyly on him ever since last Whitsuntide twelvemonth, when there was so much talk about his being away from home days and days together.</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c3.s15">There was something wrong, more than common--that was quite clear; for Mr. Godfrey didn't look half so fresh-coloured and open as he used to do.</s> <s sid="16" id="silas.c3.s16">At one time everybody was saying, What a handsome couple he and Miss Nancy Lammeter would make! and if she could come to be mistress at the Red House, there would be a fine change, for the Lammeters had been brought up in that way, that they never suffered a pinch of salt to be wasted, and yet everybody in their household had of the best, according to his place.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c3.s17">Such a daughter-in-law would be a saving to the old Squire, if she never brought a penny to her fortune; for it was to be feared that, notwithstanding his incomings, there were more holes in his pocket than the one where he put his own hand in.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c3.s18">But if Mr. Godfrey didn't turn over a new leaf, he might say "Good-bye" to Miss Nancy Lammeter.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="silas.c3.p39"><s sid="138" id="silas.c3.s138">With that, Dunstan slammed the door behind him, and left Godfrey to that bitter rumination on his personal circumstances which was now unbroken from day to day save by the excitement of sporting, drinking, card-playing, or the rarer and less oblivious pleasure of seeing Miss Nancy Lammeter.</s> <s sid="139" id="silas.c3.s139">The subtle and varied pains springing from the higher sensibility that accompanies higher culture, are perhaps less pitiable than that dreary absence of impersonal enjoyment and consolation which leaves ruder minds to the perpetual urgent companionship of their own griefs and discontents.</s> <s sid="140" id="silas.c3.s140">The lives of those rural forefathers, whom we are apt to think very prosaic figures--men whose only work was to ride round their land, getting heavier and heavier in their saddles, and who passed the rest of their days in the half-listless gratification of senses dulled by monotony--had a certain pathos in them nevertheless.</s> <s sid="141" id="silas.c3.s141">Calamities came to _them_ too, and their early errors carried hard consequences: perhaps the love of some sweet maiden, the image of purity, order, and calm, had opened their eyes to the vision of a life in which the days would not seem too long, even without rioting; but the maiden was lost, and the vision passed away, and then what was left to them, especially when they had become too heavy for the hunt, or for carrying a gun over the furrows, but to drink and get merry, or to drink and get angry, so that they might be independent of variety, and say over again with eager emphasis the things they had said already any time that twelvemonth?</s> <s sid="142" id="silas.c3.s142">Assuredly, among these flushed and dull-eyed men there were some whom--thanks to their native human-kindness--even riot could never drive into brutality; men who, when their cheeks were fresh, had felt the keen point of sorrow or remorse, had been pierced by the reeds they leaned on, or had lightly put their limbs in fetters from which no struggle could loose them; and under these sad circumstances, common to us all, their thoughts could find no resting-place outside the ever-trodden round of their own petty history.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="silas.c3.p40"><s sid="143" id="silas.c3.s143">That, at least, was the condition of Godfrey Cass in this six-and-twentieth year of his life.</s> <s sid="144" id="silas.c3.s144">A movement of compunction, helped by those small indefinable influences which every personal relation exerts on a pliant nature, had urged him into a secret marriage, which was a blight on his life.</s> <s sid="145" id="silas.c3.s145">It was an ugly story of low passion, delusion, and waking from delusion, which needs not to be dragged from the privacy of Godfrey's bitter memory.</s> <s sid="146" id="silas.c3.s146">He had long known that the delusion was partly due to a trap laid for him by Dunstan, who saw in his brother's degrading marriage the means of gratifying at once his jealous hate and his cupidity.</s> <s sid="147" id="silas.c3.s147">And if Godfrey could have felt himself simply a victim, the iron bit that destiny had put into his mouth would have chafed him less intolerably.</s> <s sid="148" id="silas.c3.s148">If the curses he muttered half aloud when he was alone had had no other object than Dunstan's diabolical cunning, he might have shrunk less from the consequences of avowal.</s> <s sid="149" id="silas.c3.s149">But he had something else to curse--his own vicious folly, which now seemed as mad and unaccountable to him as almost all our follies and vices do when their promptings have long passed away.</s> <s sid="150" id="silas.c3.s150">For four years he had thought of Nancy Lammeter, and wooed her with tacit patient worship, as the woman who made him think of the future with joy: she would be his wife, and would make home lovely to him, as his father's home had never been; and it would be easy, when she was always near, to shake off those foolish habits that were no pleasures, but only a feverish way of annulling vacancy.</s> <s sid="151" id="silas.c3.s151">Godfrey's was an essentially domestic nature, bred up in a home where the hearth had no smiles, and where the daily habits were not chastised by the presence of household order.</s> <s sid="152" id="silas.c3.s152">His easy disposition made him fall in unresistingly with the family courses, but the need of some tender permanent affection, the longing for some influence that would make the good he preferred easy to pursue, caused the neatness, purity, and liberal orderliness of the Lammeter household, sunned by the smile of Nancy, to seem like those fresh bright hours of the morning when temptations go to sleep and leave the ear open to the voice of the good angel, inviting to industry, sobriety, and peace.</s> <s sid="153" id="silas.c3.s153">And yet the hope of this paradise had not been enough to save him from a course which shut him out of it for ever.</s> <s sid="154" id="silas.c3.s154">Instead of keeping fast hold of the strong silken rope by which Nancy would have drawn him safe to the green banks where it was easy to step firmly, he had let himself be dragged back into mud and slime, in which it was useless to struggle.</s> <s sid="155" id="silas.c3.s155">He had made ties for himself which robbed him of all wholesome motive, and were a constant exasperation.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="silas.c3.p41"><s sid="156" id="silas.c3.s156">Still, there was one position worse than the present: it was the position he would be in when the ugly secret was disclosed; and the desire that continually triumphed over every other was that of warding off the evil day, when he would have to bear the consequences of his father's violent resentment for the wound inflicted on his family pride--would have, perhaps, to turn his back on that hereditary ease and dignity which, after all, was a sort of reason for living, and would carry with him the certainty that he was banished for ever from the sight and esteem of Nancy Lammeter.</s> <s sid="157" id="silas.c3.s157">The longer the interval, the more chance there was of deliverance from some, at least, of the hateful consequences to which he had sold himself; the more opportunities remained for him to snatch the strange gratification of seeing Nancy, and gathering some faint indications of her lingering regard.</s> <s sid="158" id="silas.c3.s158">Towards this gratification he was impelled, fitfully, every now and then, after having passed weeks in which he had avoided her as the far-off bright-winged prize that only made him spring forward and find his chain all the more galling.</s> <s sid="159" id="silas.c3.s159">One of those fits of yearning was on him now, and it would have been strong enough to have persuaded him to trust Wildfire to Dunstan rather than disappoint the yearning, even if he had not had another reason for his disinclination towards the morrow's hunt.</s> <s sid="160" id="silas.c3.s160">That other reason was the fact that the morning's meet was near Batherley, the market-town where the unhappy woman lived, whose image became more odious to him every day; and to his thought the whole vicinage was haunted by her.</s> <s sid="161" id="silas.c3.s161">The yoke a man creates for himself by wrong-doing will breed hate in the kindliest nature; and the good-humoured, affectionate-hearted Godfrey Cass was fast becoming a bitter man, visited by cruel wishes, that seemed to enter, and depart, and enter again, like demons who had found in him a ready-garnished home.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="silas.c3.p42"><s sid="162" id="silas.c3.s162">What was he to do this evening to pass the time?</s> <s sid="163" id="silas.c3.s163">He might as well go to the Rainbow, and hear the talk about the cock-fighting: everybody was there, and what else was there to be done?</s> <s sid="164" id="silas.c3.s164">Though, for his own part, he did not care a button for cock-fighting.</s> <s sid="165" id="silas.c3.s165">Snuff, the brown spaniel, who had placed herself in front of him, and had been watching him for some time, now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress.</s> <s sid="166" id="silas.c3.s166">But Godfrey thrust her away without looking at her, and left the room, followed humbly by the unresenting Snuff--perhaps because she saw no other career open to her.</s> </p>

<qe/><title>PART 1. CHAPTER IV.</title>
<p pid="1" id="silas.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c4.s1">Dunstan Cass, setting off in the raw morning, at the judiciously quiet pace of a man who is obliged to ride to cover on his hunter, had to take his way along the lane which, at its farther extremity, passed by the piece of unenclosed ground called the Stone-pit, where stood the cottage, once a stone-cutter's shed, now for fifteen years inhabited by Silas Marner.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c4.s2">The spot looked very dreary at this season, with the moist trodden clay about it, and the red, muddy water high up in the deserted quarry.</s> <s sid="3" id="silas.c4.s3">That was Dunstan's first thought as he approached it; the second was, that the old fool of a weaver, whose loom he heard rattling already, had a great deal of money hidden somewhere.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c4.s4">How was it that he, Dunstan Cass, who had often heard talk of Marner's miserliness, had never thought of suggesting to Godfrey that he should frighten or persuade the old fellow into lending the money on the excellent security of the young Squire's prospects?</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c4.s5">The resource occurred to him now as so easy and agreeable, especially as Marner's hoard was likely to be large enough to leave Godfrey a handsome surplus beyond his immediate needs, and enable him to accommodate his faithful brother, that he had almost turned the horse's head towards home again.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c4.s6">Godfrey would be ready enough to accept the suggestion: he would snatch eagerly at a plan that might save him from parting with Wildfire.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c4.s7">But when Dunstan's meditation reached this point, the inclination to go on grew strong and prevailed.</s> <s sid="8" id="silas.c4.s8">He didn't want to give Godfrey that pleasure: he preferred that Master Godfrey should be vexed.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c4.s9">Moreover, Dunstan enjoyed the self-important consciousness of having a horse to sell, and the opportunity of driving a bargain, swaggering, and possibly taking somebody in.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c4.s10">He might have all the satisfaction attendant on selling his brother's horse, and not the less have the further satisfaction of setting Godfrey to borrow Marner's money.</s> <s sid="11" id="silas.c4.s11">So he rode on to cover.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c4.p2"><s sid="12" id="silas.c4.s12">Bryce and Keating were there, as Dunstan was quite sure they would be--he was such a lucky fellow.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c4.p3" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="silas.c4.s13"><qs/>"Heyday!"<qe/><sls/>  said Bryce, who had long had his eye on Wildfire, <sle/><qs/>"you're on your brother's horse to-day: how's that?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="silas.c4.s14"><qs/>"Oh, I've swopped with him,"<qe/><sls/> said Dunstan, whose delight in lying, grandly independent of utility, was not to be diminished by the likelihood that his hearer would not believe him--<sle/><qs/>"Wildfire's mine now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c4.p5" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="silas.c4.s15"><qs/>"What!  has he swopped with you for that big-boned hack of yours?"<qe/> said Bryce, quite aware that he should get another lie in answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c4.p6" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="silas.c4.s16"><qs/>"Oh, there was a little account between us,"<qe/><sss/> said Dunsey, carelessly, <sse/><qs/>"and Wildfire made it even.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c4.s17">I accommodated him by taking the horse, though it was against my will, for I'd got an itch for a mare o' Jortin's--as rare a bit o' blood as ever you threw your leg across.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c4.s18">But I shall keep Wildfire, now I've got him, though I'd a bid of a hundred and fifty for him the other day, from a man over at Flitton--he's buying for Lord Cromleck--a fellow with a cast in his eye, and a green waistcoat.</s> <s sid="19" id="silas.c4.s19">But I mean to stick to Wildfire:</s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c4.s20">I shan't get a better at a fence in a hurry.</s> <s sid="21" id="silas.c4.s21">The mare's got more blood, but she's a bit too weak in the hind-quarters."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c4.p7"><s sid="22" id="silas.c4.s22">Bryce of course divined that Dunstan wanted to sell the horse, and Dunstan knew that he divined it (horse-dealing is only one of many human transactions carried on in this ingenious manner); and they both considered that the bargain was in its first stage, when Bryce replied ironically--</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c4.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="silas.c4.s23"><qs/>"I wonder at that now; I wonder you mean to keep him; for I never heard of a man who didn't want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as much again as the horse was worth.</s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c4.s24">You'll be lucky if you get a hundred."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c4.p9"><s sid="25" id="silas.c4.s25">Keating rode up now, and the transaction became more complicated.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c4.s26">It ended in the purchase of the horse by Bryce for a hundred and twenty, to be paid on the delivery of Wildfire, safe and sound, at the Batherley stables.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c4.s27">It did occur to Dunsey that it might be wise for him to give up the day's hunting, proceed at once to Batherley, and, having waited for Bryce's return, hire a horse to carry him home with the money in his pocket.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c4.s28">But the inclination for a run, encouraged by confidence in his luck, and by a draught of brandy from his pocket-pistol at the conclusion of the bargain, was not easy to overcome, especially with a horse under him that would take the fences to the admiration of the field.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c4.s29">Dunstan, however, took one fence too many, and got his horse pierced with a hedge-stake.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c4.s30">His own ill-favoured person, which was quite unmarketable, escaped without injury; but poor Wildfire, unconscious of his price, turned on his flank and painfully panted his last.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c4.s31">It happened that Dunstan, a short time before, having had to get down to arrange his stirrup, had muttered a good many curses at this interruption, which had thrown him in the rear of the hunt near the moment of glory, and under this exasperation had taken the fences more blindly.</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c4.s32">He would soon have been up with the hounds again, when the fatal accident happened; and hence he was between eager riders in advance, not troubling themselves about what happened behind them, and far-off stragglers, who were as likely as not to pass quite aloof from the line of road in which Wildfire had fallen.</s> <s sid="33" id="silas.c4.s33">Dunstan, whose nature it was to care more for immediate annoyances than for remote consequences, no sooner recovered his legs, and saw that it was all over with Wildfire, than he felt a satisfaction at the absence of witnesses to a position which no swaggering could make enviable.</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c4.s34">Reinforcing himself, after his shake, with a little brandy and much swearing, he walked as fast as he could to a coppice on his right hand, through which it occurred to him that he could make his way to Batherley without danger of encountering any member of the hunt.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c4.s35">His first intention was to hire a horse there and ride home forthwith, for to walk many miles without a gun in his hand, and along an ordinary road, was as much out of the question to him as to other spirited young men of his kind.</s> <s sid="36" id="silas.c4.s36">He did not much mind about taking the bad news to Godfrey, for he had to offer him at the same time the resource of Marner's money; and if Godfrey kicked, as he always did, at the notion of making a fresh debt from which he himself got the smallest share of advantage, why, he wouldn't kick long:</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c4.s37">Dunstan felt sure he could worry Godfrey into anything.</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c4.s38">The idea of Marner's money kept growing in vividness, now the want of it had become immediate; the prospect of having to make his appearance with the muddy boots of a pedestrian at Batherley, and to encounter the grinning queries of stablemen, stood unpleasantly in the way of his impatience to be back at Raveloe and carry out his felicitous plan; and a casual visitation of his waistcoat-pocket, as he was ruminating, awakened his memory to the fact that the two or three small coins his forefinger encountered there were of too pale a colour to cover that small debt, without payment of which the stable-keeper had declared he would never do any more business with Dunsey Cass.</s> <s sid="39" id="silas.c4.s39">After all, according to the direction in which the run had brought him, he was not so very much farther from home than he was from Batherley; but Dunsey, not being remarkable for clearness of head, was only led to this conclusion by the gradual perception that there were other reasons for choosing the unprecedented course of walking home.</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c4.s40">It was now nearly four o'clock, and a mist was gathering: the sooner he got into the road the better.</s> <s sid="41" id="silas.c4.s41">He remembered having crossed the road and seen the finger-post only a little while before Wildfire broke down; so, buttoning his coat, twisting the lash of his hunting-whip compactly round the handle, and rapping the tops of his boots with a self-possessed air, as if to assure himself that he was not at all taken by surprise, he set off with the sense that he was undertaking a remarkable feat of bodily exertion, which somehow and at some time he should be able to dress up and magnify to the admiration of a select circle at the Rainbow.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c4.s42">When a young gentleman like Dunsey is reduced to so exceptional a mode of locomotion as walking, a whip in his hand is a desirable corrective to a too bewildering dreamy sense of unwontedness in his position; and Dunstan, as he went along through the gathering mist, was always rapping his whip somewhere.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c4.s43">It was Godfrey's whip, which he had chosen to take without leave because it had a gold handle; of course no one could see, when Dunstan held it, that the name _Godfrey Cass_ was cut in deep letters on that gold handle--they could only see that it was a very handsome whip.</s> <s sid="44" id="silas.c4.s44">Dunsey was not without fear that he might meet some acquaintance in whose eyes he would cut a pitiable figure, for mist is no screen when people get close to each other; but when he at last found himself in the well-known Raveloe lanes without having met a soul, he silently remarked that that was part of his usual good luck.</s> <s sid="45" id="silas.c4.s45">But now the mist, helped by the evening darkness, was more of a screen than he desired, for it hid the ruts into which his feet were liable to slip--hid everything, so that he had to guide his steps by dragging his whip along the low bushes in advance of the hedgerow.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c4.s46">He must soon, he thought, be getting near the opening at the Stone-pits: he should find it out by the break in the hedgerow.</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c4.s47">He found it out, however, by another circumstance which he had not expected--namely, by certain gleams of light, which he presently guessed to proceed from Silas Marner's cottage.</s> <s sid="48" id="silas.c4.s48">That cottage and the money hidden within it had been in his mind continually during his walk, and he had been imagining ways of cajoling and tempting the weaver to part with the immediate possession of his money for the sake of receiving interest.</s> <s sid="49" id="silas.c4.s49">Dunstan felt as if there must be a little frightening added to the cajolery, for his own arithmetical convictions were not clear enough to afford him any forcible demonstration as to the advantages of interest; and as for security, he regarded it vaguely as a means of cheating a man by making him believe that he would be paid.</s> <s sid="50" id="silas.c4.s50">Altogether, the operation on the miser's mind was a task that Godfrey would be sure to hand over to his more daring and cunning brother:</s> <s sid="51" id="silas.c4.s51">Dunstan had made up his mind to that; and by the time he saw the light gleaming through the chinks of Marner's shutters, the idea of a dialogue with the weaver had become so familiar to him, that it occurred to him as quite a natural thing to make the acquaintance forthwith.</s> <s sid="52" id="silas.c4.s52">There might be several conveniences attending this course: the weaver had possibly got a lantern, and Dunstan was tired of feeling his way.</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c4.s53">He was still nearly three-quarters of a mile from home, and the lane was becoming unpleasantly slippery, for the mist was passing into rain.</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c4.s54">He turned up the bank, not without some fear lest he might miss the right way, since he was not certain whether the light were in front or on the side of the cottage.</s> <s sid="55" id="silas.c4.s55">But he felt the ground before him cautiously with his whip-handle, and at last arrived safely at the door.</s> <s sid="56" id="silas.c4.s56">He knocked loudly, rather enjoying the idea that the old fellow would be frightened at the sudden noise.</s> <s sid="57" id="silas.c4.s57">He heard no movement in reply: all was silence in the cottage.</s> <s sid="58" id="silas.c4.s58">Was the weaver gone to bed, then?</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c4.s59">If so, why had he left a light?</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c4.s60">That was a strange forgetfulness in a miser.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c4.s61">Dunstan knocked still more loudly, and, without pausing for a reply, pushed his fingers through the latch-hole, intending to shake the door and pull the latch-string up and down, not doubting that the door was fastened.</s> <s sid="62" id="silas.c4.s62">But, to his surprise, at this double motion the door opened, and he found himself in front of a bright fire which lit up every corner of the cottage--the bed, the loom, the three chairs, and the table--and showed him that Marner was not there.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="silas.c4.p10" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="silas.c4.s63">Nothing at that moment could be much more inviting to Dunsey than the bright fire on the brick hearth: he walked in and seated himself by it at once.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c4.s64">There was something in front of the fire, too, that would have been inviting to a hungry man, if it had been in a different stage of cooking.</s> <s sid="65" id="silas.c4.s65">It was a small bit of pork suspended from the kettle-hanger by a string passed through a large door-key, in a way known to primitive housekeepers unpossessed of jacks.</s> <s sid="66" id="silas.c4.s66">But the pork had been hung at the farthest extremity of the hanger, apparently to prevent the roasting from proceeding too rapidly during the owner's absence.</s> <s sid="67" id="silas.c4.s67">The old staring simpleton had hot meat for his supper, then? thought Dunstan.</s> <s sid="68" id="silas.c4.s68">People had always said he lived on mouldy bread, on purpose to check his appetite.</s> <s sid="69" id="silas.c4.s69">But where could he be at this time, and on such an evening, leaving his supper in this stage of preparation, and his door unfastened?</s> <s sid="70" id="silas.c4.s70">Dunstan's own recent difficulty in making his way suggested to him that the weaver had perhaps gone outside his cottage to fetch in fuel, or for some such brief purpose, and had slipped into the Stone-pit.</s> <s sid="71" id="silas.c4.s71">That was an interesting idea to Dunstan, carrying consequences of entire novelty.</s> <s sid="72" id="silas.c4.s72">If the weaver was dead, who had a right to his money?</s> <s sid="73" id="silas.c4.s73">Who would know where his money was hidden?</s> <s sid="74" id="silas.c4.s74">_Who would know that anybody had come to take it away?_  He went no farther into the subtleties of evidence: the pressing question, <qs/>"Where _is_ the money?"<qe/>  now took such entire possession of him as to make him quite forget that the weaver's death was not a certainty.</s> <s sid="75" id="silas.c4.s75">A dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.</s> <s sid="76" id="silas.c4.s76">And Dunstan's mind was as dull as the mind of a possible felon usually is.</s> <s sid="77" id="silas.c4.s77">There were only three hiding-places where he had ever heard of cottagers' hoards being found: the thatch, the bed, and a hole in the floor.</s> <s sid="78" id="silas.c4.s78">Marner's cottage had no thatch; and Dunstan's first act, after a train of thought made rapid by the stimulus of cupidity, was to go up to the bed; but while he did so, his eyes travelled eagerly over the floor, where the bricks, distinct in the fire-light, were discernible under the sprinkling of sand.</s> <s sid="79" id="silas.c4.s79">But not everywhere; for there was one spot, and one only, which was quite covered with sand, and sand showing the marks of fingers, which had apparently been careful to spread it over a given space.</s> <s sid="80" id="silas.c4.s80">It was near the treddles of the loom.</s> <s sid="81" id="silas.c4.s81">In an instant Dunstan darted to that spot, swept away the sand with his whip, and, inserting the thin end of the hook between the bricks, found that they were loose.</s> <s sid="82" id="silas.c4.s82">In haste he lifted up two bricks, and saw what he had no doubt was the object of his search; for what could there be but money in those two leathern bags?</s> <s sid="83" id="silas.c4.s83">And, from their weight, they must be filled with guineas.</s> <s sid="84" id="silas.c4.s84">Dunstan felt round the hole, to be certain that it held no more; then hastily replaced the bricks, and spread the sand over them.</s> <s sid="85" id="silas.c4.s85">Hardly more than five minutes had passed since he entered the cottage, but it seemed to Dunstan like a long while; and though he was without any distinct recognition of the possibility that Marner might be alive, and might re-enter the cottage at any moment, he felt an undefinable dread laying hold on him, as he rose to his feet with the bags in his hand.</s> <s sid="86" id="silas.c4.s86">He would hasten out into the darkness, and then consider what he should do with the bags.</s> <s sid="87" id="silas.c4.s87">He closed the door behind him immediately, that he might shut in the stream of light: a few steps would be enough to carry him beyond betrayal by the gleams from the shutter-chinks and the latch-hole.</s> <s sid="88" id="silas.c4.s88">The rain and darkness had got thicker, and he was glad of it; though it was awkward walking with both hands filled, so that it was as much as he could do to grasp his whip along with one of the bags.</s> <s sid="89" id="silas.c4.s89">But when he had gone a yard or two, he might take his time.</s> <s sid="90" id="silas.c4.s90">So he stepped forward into the darkness.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="silas.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c5.s1">When Dunstan Cass turned his back on the cottage, Silas Marner was not more than a hundred yards away from it, plodding along from the village with a sack thrown round his shoulders as an overcoat, and with a horn lantern in his hand.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c5.s2">His legs were weary, but his mind was at ease, free from the presentiment of change.</s> <s sid="3" id="silas.c5.s3">The sense of security more frequently springs from habit than from conviction, and for this reason it often subsists after such a change in the conditions as might have been expected to suggest alarm.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c5.s4">The lapse of time during which a given event has not happened, is, in this logic of habit, constantly alleged as a reason why the event should never happen, even when the lapse of time is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c5.s5">A man will tell you that he has worked in a mine for forty years unhurt by an accident as a reason why he should apprehend no danger, though the roof is beginning to sink; and it is often observable, that the older a man gets, the more difficult it is to him to retain a believing conception of his own death.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c5.s6">This influence of habit was necessarily strong in a man whose life was so monotonous as Marner's--who saw no new people and heard of no new events to keep alive in him the idea of the unexpected and the changeful; and it explains simply enough, why his mind could be at ease, though he had left his house and his treasure more defenceless than usual.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c5.s7">Silas was thinking with double complacency of his supper: first, because it would be hot and savoury; and secondly, because it would cost him nothing.</s> <s sid="8" id="silas.c5.s8">For the little bit of pork was a present from that excellent housewife, Miss Priscilla Lammeter, to whom he had this day carried home a handsome piece of linen; and it was only on occasion of a present like this, that Silas indulged himself with roast-meat.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c5.s9">Supper was his favourite meal, because it came at his time of revelry, when his heart warmed over his gold; whenever he had roast-meat, he always chose to have it for supper.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c5.s10">But this evening, he had no sooner ingeniously knotted his string fast round his bit of pork, twisted the string according to rule over his door-key, passed it through the handle, and made it fast on the hanger, than he remembered that a piece of very fine twine was indispensable to his "setting up" a new piece of work in his loom early in the morning.</s> <s sid="11" id="silas.c5.s11">It had slipped his memory, because, in coming from Mr. Lammeter's, he had not had to pass through the village; but to lose time by going on errands in the morning was out of the question.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c5.s12">It was a nasty fog to turn out into, but there were things Silas loved better than his own comfort; so, drawing his pork to the extremity of the hanger, and arming himself with his lantern and his old sack, he set out on what, in ordinary weather, would have been a twenty minutes' errand.</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c5.s13">He could not have locked his door without undoing his well-knotted string and retarding his supper; it was not worth his while to make that sacrifice.</s> <s sid="14" id="silas.c5.s14">What thief would find his way to the Stone-pits on such a night as this? and why should he come on this particular night, when he had never come through all the fifteen years before?</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c5.s15">These questions were not distinctly present in Silas's mind; they merely serve to represent the vaguely-felt foundation of his freedom from anxiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c5.p2"><s sid="16" id="silas.c5.s16">He reached his door in much satisfaction that his errand was done: he opened it, and to his short-sighted eyes everything remained as he had left it, except that the fire sent out a welcome increase of heat.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c5.s17">He trod about the floor while putting by his lantern and throwing aside his hat and sack, so as to merge the marks of Dunstan's feet on the sand in the marks of his own nailed boots.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c5.s18">Then he moved his pork nearer to the fire, and sat down to the agreeable business of tending the meat and warming himself at the same time.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c5.p3"><s sid="19" id="silas.c5.s19">Any one who had looked at him as the red light shone upon his pale face, strange straining eyes, and meagre form, would perhaps have understood the mixture of contemptuous pity, dread, and suspicion with which he was regarded by his neighbours in Raveloe.</s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c5.s20">Yet few men could be more harmless than poor Marner.</s> <s sid="21" id="silas.c5.s21">In his truthful simple soul, not even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice directly injurious to others.</s> <s sid="22" id="silas.c5.s22">The light of his faith quite put out, and his affections made desolate, he had clung with all the force of his nature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man devotes himself, they had fashioned him into correspondence with themselves.</s> <s sid="23" id="silas.c5.s23">His loom, as he wrought in it without ceasing, had in its turn wrought on him, and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving for its monotonous response.</s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c5.s24">His gold, as he hung over it and saw it grow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c5.p4"><s sid="25" id="silas.c5.s25">As soon as he was warm he began to think it would be a long while to wait till after supper before he drew out his guineas, and it would be pleasant to see them on the table before him as he ate his unwonted feast.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c5.s26">For joy is the best of wine, and Silas's guineas were a golden wine of that sort.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c5.p5"><s sid="27" id="silas.c5.s27">He rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his loom, swept away the sand without noticing any change, and removed the bricks.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c5.s28">The sight of the empty hole made his heart leap violently, but the belief that his gold was gone could not come at once--only terror, and the eager effort to put an end to the terror.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c5.s29">He passed his trembling hand all about the hole, trying to think it possible that his eyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in the hole and examined it curiously, trembling more and more.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c5.s30">At last he shook so violently that he let fall the candle, and lifted his hands to his head, trying to steady himself, that he might think.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c5.s31">Had he put his gold somewhere else, by a sudden resolution last night, and then forgotten it?</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c5.s32">A man falling into dark waters seeks a momentary footing even on sliding stones; and Silas, by acting as if he believed in false hopes, warded off the moment of despair.</s> <s sid="33" id="silas.c5.s33">He searched in every corner, he turned his bed over, and shook it, and kneaded it; he looked in his brick oven where he laid his sticks.</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c5.s34">When there was no other place to be searched, he kneeled down again and felt once more all round the hole.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c5.s35">There was no untried refuge left for a moment's shelter from the terrible truth.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c5.p6"><s sid="36" id="silas.c5.s36">Yes, there was a sort of refuge which always comes with the prostration of thought under an overpowering passion: it was that expectation of impossibilities, that belief in contradictory images, which is still distinct from madness, because it is capable of being dissipated by the external fact.</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c5.s37">Silas got up from his knees trembling, and looked round at the table: didn't the gold lie there after all?</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c5.s38">The table was bare.</s> <s sid="39" id="silas.c5.s39">Then he turned and looked behind him--looked all round his dwelling, seeming to strain his brown eyes after some possible appearance of the bags where he had already sought them in vain.</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c5.s40">He could see every object in his cottage--and his gold was not there.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c5.p7"><s sid="41" id="silas.c5.s41">Again he put his trembling hands to his head, and gave a wild ringing scream, the cry of desolation.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c5.s42">For a few moments after, he stood motionless; but the cry had relieved him from the first maddening pressure of the truth.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c5.s43">He turned, and tottered towards his loom, and got into the seat where he worked, instinctively seeking this as the strongest assurance of reality.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c5.p8"><s sid="44" id="silas.c5.s44">And now that all the false hopes had vanished, and the first shock of certainty was past, the idea of a thief began to present itself, and he entertained it eagerly, because a thief might be caught and made to restore the gold.</s> <s sid="45" id="silas.c5.s45">The thought brought some new strength with it, and he started from his loom to the door.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c5.s46">As he opened it the rain beat in upon him, for it was falling more and more heavily.</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c5.s47">There were no footsteps to be tracked on such a night--footsteps?</s> <s sid="48" id="silas.c5.s48">When had the thief come?</s> <s sid="49" id="silas.c5.s49">During Silas's absence in the daytime the door had been locked, and there had been no marks of any inroad on his return by daylight.</s> <s sid="50" id="silas.c5.s50">And in the evening, too, he said to himself, everything was the same as when he had left it.</s> <s sid="51" id="silas.c5.s51">The sand and bricks looked as if they had not been moved.</s> <s sid="52" id="silas.c5.s52">_Was_ it a thief who had taken the bags?  or was it a cruel power that no hands could reach, which had delighted in making him a second time desolate?</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c5.s53">He shrank from this vaguer dread, and fixed his mind with struggling effort on the robber with hands, who could be reached by hands.</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c5.s54">His thoughts glanced at all the neighbours who had made any remarks, or asked any questions which he might now regard as a ground of suspicion.</s> <s sid="55" id="silas.c5.s55">There was Jem Rodney, a known poacher, and otherwise disreputable: he had often met Marner in his journeys across the fields, and had said something jestingly about the weaver's money; nay, he had once irritated Marner, by lingering at the fire when he called to light his pipe, instead of going about his business.</s> <s sid="56" id="silas.c5.s56">Jem Rodney was the man--there was ease in the thought.</s> <s sid="57" id="silas.c5.s57">Jem could be found and made to restore the money:</s> <s sid="58" id="silas.c5.s58">Marner did not want to punish him, but only to get back his gold which had gone from him, and left his soul like a forlorn traveller on an unknown desert.</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c5.s59">The robber must be laid hold of.</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c5.s60">Marner's ideas of legal authority were confused, but he felt that he must go and proclaim his loss; and the great people in the village--the clergyman, the constable, and Squire Cass--would make Jem Rodney, or somebody else, deliver up the stolen money.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c5.s61">He rushed out in the rain, under the stimulus of this hope, forgetting to cover his head, not caring to fasten his door; for he felt as if he had nothing left to lose.</s> <s sid="62" id="silas.c5.s62">He ran swiftly, till want of breath compelled him to slacken his pace as he was entering the village at the turning close to the Rainbow.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c5.p9"><s sid="63" id="silas.c5.s63">The Rainbow, in Marner's view, was a place of luxurious resort for rich and stout husbands, whose wives had superfluous stores of linen; it was the place where he was likely to find the powers and dignities of Raveloe, and where he could most speedily make his loss public.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c5.s64">He lifted the latch, and turned into the bright bar or kitchen on the right hand, where the less lofty customers of the house were in the habit of assembling, the parlour on the left being reserved for the more select society in which Squire Cass frequently enjoyed the double pleasure of conviviality and condescension.</s> <s sid="65" id="silas.c5.s65">But the parlour was dark to-night, the chief personages who ornamented its circle being all at Mrs. Osgood's birthday dance, as Godfrey Cass was.</s> <s sid="66" id="silas.c5.s66">And in consequence of this, the party on the high-screened seats in the kitchen was more numerous than usual; several personages, who would otherwise have been admitted into the parlour and enlarged the opportunity of hectoring and condescension for their betters, being content this evening to vary their enjoyment by taking their spirits-and-water where they could themselves hector and condescend in company that called for beer.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c8.p2"><s sid="4" id="silas.c8.s4">The next morning the whole village was excited by the story of the robbery, and Godfrey, like every one else, was occupied in gathering and discussing news about it, and in visiting the Stone-pits.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c8.s5">The rain had washed away all possibility of distinguishing foot-marks, but a close investigation of the spot had disclosed, in the direction opposite to the village, a tinder-box, with a flint and steel, half sunk in the mud.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c8.s6">It was not Silas's tinder-box, for the only one he had ever had was still standing on his shelf; and the inference generally accepted was, that the tinder-box in the ditch was somehow connected with the robbery.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c8.s7">A small minority shook their heads, and intimated their opinion that it was not a robbery to have much light thrown on it by tinder-boxes, that Master Marner's tale had a queer look with it, and that such things had been known as a man's doing himself a mischief, and then setting the justice to look for the doer.</s> <s sid="8" id="silas.c8.s8">But when questioned closely as to their grounds for this opinion, and what Master Marner had to gain by such false pretences, they only shook their heads as before, and observed that there was no knowing what some folks counted gain; moreover, that everybody had a right to their own opinions, grounds or no grounds, and that the weaver, as everybody knew, was partly crazy.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c8.s9">Mr. Macey, though he joined in the defence of Marner against all suspicions of deceit, also pooh-poohed the tinder-box; indeed, repudiated it as a rather impious suggestion, tending to imply that everything must be done by human hands, and that there was no power which could make away with the guineas without moving the bricks.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c8.s10">Nevertheless, he turned round rather sharply on Mr. Tookey, when the zealous deputy, feeling that this was a view of the case peculiarly suited to a parish-clerk, carried it still farther, and doubted whether it was right to inquire into a robbery at all when the circumstances were so mysterious.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c8.p3" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="silas.c8.s11"><qs/>"As if,"<qe/><sss/> concluded Mr. Tookey--<sse/><qs/>"as if there was nothing but what could be made out by justices and constables."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="silas.c8.s12"><qs/>"Now, don't you be for overshooting the mark, Tookey,"<qe/> said Mr. Macey, nodding his head aside admonishingly.</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c8.s13"><qs/>"That's what you're allays at; if I throw a stone and hit, you think there's summat better than hitting, and you try to throw a stone beyond.</s> <s sid="14" id="silas.c8.s14">What I said was against the tinder-box:</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c8.s15">I said nothing against justices and constables, for they're o' King George's making, and it 'ud be ill-becoming a man in a parish office to fly out again' King George."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c8.p5"><s sid="16" id="silas.c8.s16">While these discussions were going on amongst the group outside the Rainbow, a higher consultation was being carried on within, under the presidency of Mr. Crackenthorp, the rector, assisted by Squire Cass and other substantial parishioners.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c8.s17">It had just occurred to Mr. Snell, the landlord--he being, as he observed, a man accustomed to put two and two together--to connect with the tinder-box, which, as deputy-constable, he himself had had the honourable distinction of finding, certain recollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a month before, and had actually stated that he carried a tinder-box about with him to light his pipe.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c8.s18">Here, surely, was a clue to be followed out.</s> <s sid="19" id="silas.c8.s19">And as memory, when duly impregnated with ascertained facts, is sometimes surprisingly fertile, Mr. Snell gradually recovered a vivid impression of the effect produced on him by the pedlar's countenance and conversation.</s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c8.s20">He had a "look with his eye" which fell unpleasantly on Mr. Snell's sensitive organism.</s> <s sid="21" id="silas.c8.s21">To be sure, he didn't say anything particular--no, except that about the tinder-box--but it isn't what a man says, it's the way he says it.</s> <s sid="22" id="silas.c8.s22">Moreover, he had a swarthy foreignness of complexion which boded little honesty.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c8.p6" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="silas.c8.s23"><qs/>"Did he wear ear-rings?"<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c8.s24">Mr. Crackenthorp wished to know, having some acquaintance with foreign customs.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c8.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="silas.c8.s25"><qs/>"Well--stay--let me see,"<qe/> said Mr. Snell, like a docile clairvoyante, who would really not make a mistake if she could help it.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c8.s26">After stretching the corners of his mouth and contracting his eyes, as if he were trying to see the ear-rings, he appeared to give up the effort, and said, <qs/>"Well, he'd got ear-rings in his box to sell, so it's nat'ral to suppose he might wear 'em.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c8.s27">But he called at every house, a'most, in the village; there's somebody else, mayhap, saw 'em in his ears, though I can't take upon me rightly to say."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c8.p8"><s sid="28" id="silas.c8.s28">Mr. Snell was correct in his surmise, that somebody else would remember the pedlar's ear-rings.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c8.s29">For on the spread of inquiry among the villagers it was stated with gathering emphasis, that the parson had wanted to know whether the pedlar wore ear-rings in his ears, and an impression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of this fact.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c8.s30">Of course, every one who heard the question, not having any distinct image of the pedlar as _without_ ear-rings, immediately had an image of him _with_ ear-rings, larger or smaller, as the case might be; and the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection, so that the glazier's wife, a well-intentioned woman, not given to lying, and whose house was among the cleanest in the village, was ready to declare, as sure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next Christmas that was ever coming, that she had seen big ear-rings, in the shape of the young moon, in the pedlar's two ears; while Jinny Oates, the cobbler's daughter, being a more imaginative person, stated not only that she had seen them too, but that they had made her blood creep, as it did at that very moment while there she stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c8.p9"><s sid="31" id="silas.c8.s31">Also, by way of throwing further light on this clue of the tinder-box, a collection was made of all the articles purchased from the pedlar at various houses, and carried to the Rainbow to be exhibited there.</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c8.s32">In fact, there was a general feeling in the village, that for the clearing-up of this robbery there must be a great deal done at the Rainbow, and that no man need offer his wife an excuse for going there while it was the scene of severe public duties.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="silas.c8.p10"><s sid="33" id="silas.c8.s33">Some disappointment was felt, and perhaps a little indignation also, when it became known that Silas Marner, on being questioned by the Squire and the parson, had retained no other recollection of the pedlar than that he had called at his door, but had not entered his house, having turned away at once when Silas, holding the door ajar, had said that he wanted nothing.</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c8.s34">This had been Silas's testimony, though he clutched strongly at the idea of the pedlar's being the culprit, if only because it gave him a definite image of a whereabout for his gold after it had been taken away from its hiding-place: he could see it now in the pedlar's box.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c8.s35">But it was observed with some irritation in the village, that anybody but a "blind creatur" like Marner would have seen the man prowling about, for how came he to leave his tinder-box in the ditch close by, if he hadn't been lingering there?</s> <s sid="36" id="silas.c8.s36">Doubtless, he had made his observations when he saw Marner at the door.</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c8.s37">Anybody might know--and only look at him--that the weaver was a half-crazy miser.</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c8.s38">It was a wonder the pedlar hadn't murdered him; men of that sort, with rings in their ears, had been known for murderers often and often; there had been one tried at the 'sizes, not so long ago but what there were people living who remembered it.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="silas.c8.p11" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="silas.c8.s39">Godfrey Cass, indeed, entering the Rainbow during one of Mr. Snell's frequently repeated recitals of his testimony, had treated it lightly, stating that he himself had bought a pen-knife of the pedlar, and thought him a merry grinning fellow enough; it was all nonsense, he said, about the man's evil looks.</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c8.s40">But this was spoken of in the village as the random talk of youth, <qs/>"as if it was only Mr. Snell who had seen something odd about the pedlar!"<qe/></s> <s sid="41" id="silas.c8.s41">On the contrary, there were at least half-a-dozen who were ready to go before Justice Malam, and give in much more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c8.s42">It was to be hoped Mr. Godfrey would not go to Tarley and throw cold water on what Mr. Snell said there, and so prevent the justice from drawing up a warrant.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c8.s43">He was suspected of intending this, when, after mid-day, he was seen setting off on horseback in the direction of Tarley.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="silas.c8.p12"><s sid="44" id="silas.c8.s44">But by this time Godfrey's interest in the robbery had faded before his growing anxiety about Dunstan and Wildfire, and he was going, not to Tarley, but to Batherley, unable to rest in uncertainty about them any longer.</s> <s sid="45" id="silas.c8.s45">The possibility that Dunstan had played him the ugly trick of riding away with Wildfire, to return at the end of a month, when he had gambled away or otherwise squandered the price of the horse, was a fear that urged itself upon him more, even, than the thought of an accidental injury; and now that the dance at Mrs. Osgood's was past, he was irritated with himself that he had trusted his horse to Dunstan.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c8.s46">Instead of trying to still his fears, he encouraged them, with that superstitious impression which clings to us all, that if we expect evil very strongly it is the less likely to come; and when he heard a horse approaching at a trot, and saw a hat rising above a hedge beyond an angle of the lane, he felt as if his conjuration had succeeded.</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c8.s47">But no sooner did the horse come within sight, than his heart sank again.</s> <s sid="48" id="silas.c8.s48">It was not Wildfire; and in a few moments more he discerned that the rider was not Dunstan, but Bryce, who pulled up to speak, with a face that implied something disagreeable.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="silas.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="silas.c8.s49"><qs/>"Well, Mr. Godfrey, that's a lucky brother of yours, that Master Dunsey, isn't he?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="silas.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="silas.c8.s50"><qs/>"What do you mean?"<qe/>  said Godfrey, hastily.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="silas.c8.p15" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="silas.c8.s51"><qs/>"Why, hasn't he been home yet?"<qe/>  said Bryce.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="silas.c8.p16" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="silas.c8.s52"><qs/>"Home?  no.</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c8.s53">What has happened?</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c8.s54">Be quick.</s> <s sid="55" id="silas.c8.s55">What has he done with my horse?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="silas.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="silas.c8.s56"><qs/>"Ah, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it to him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="silas.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="silas.c8.s57"><qs/>"Has he thrown him down and broken his knees?"<qe/>  said Godfrey, flushed with exasperation.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="silas.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="silas.c8.s58"><qs/>"Worse than that,"<qe/> said Bryce.</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c8.s59"><qs/>"You see, I'd made a bargain with him to buy the horse for a hundred and twenty--a swinging price, but I always liked the horse.</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c8.s60">And what does he do but go and stake him--fly at a hedge with stakes in it, atop of a bank with a ditch before it.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c8.s61">The horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found.</s> <s sid="62" id="silas.c8.s62">So he hasn't been home since, has he?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="silas.c8.p20" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="silas.c8.s63"><qs/>"Home?  no,"<qe/><sss/> said Godfrey, <sse/><qs/>"and he'd better keep away.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c8.s64">Confound me for a fool!</s> <s sid="65" id="silas.c8.s65">I might have known this would be the end of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="silas.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="silas.c8.s66"><qs/>"Well, to tell you the truth,"<qe/><sss/> said Bryce, <sse/><qs/>"after I'd bargained for the horse, it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the horse without your knowledge, for I didn't believe it was his own.</s> <s sid="67" id="silas.c8.s67">I knew Master Dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes.</s> <s sid="68" id="silas.c8.s68">But where can he be gone?</s> <s sid="69" id="silas.c8.s69">He's never been seen at Batherley.</s> <s sid="70" id="silas.c8.s70">He couldn't have been hurt, for he must have walked off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="silas.c8.p22" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="silas.c8.s71"><qs/>"Hurt?"<qe/>  said Godfrey, bitterly.</s> <s sid="72" id="silas.c8.s72"><qs/>"He'll never be hurt--he's made to hurt other people."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="silas.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="silas.c8.s73"><qs/>"And so you _did_ give him leave to sell the horse, eh?"<qe/>  said Bryce.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="silas.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="silas.c8.s74"><qs/>"Yes; I wanted to part with the horse--he was always a little too hard in the mouth for me,"<qe/> said Godfrey; his pride making him wince under the idea that Bryce guessed the sale to be a matter of necessity.</s> <s sid="75" id="silas.c8.s75"><qs/>"I was going to see after him--I thought some mischief had happened.</s> <s sid="76" id="silas.c8.s76">I'll go back now,"<qe/> he added, turning the horse's head, and wishing he could get rid of Bryce; for he felt that the long-dreaded crisis in his life was close upon him.</s> <s sid="77" id="silas.c8.s77"><qs/>"You're coming on to Raveloe, aren't you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="silas.c8.p25" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="silas.c8.s78"><qs/>"Well, no, not now,"<qe/> said Bryce.</s> <s sid="79" id="silas.c8.s79"><qs/>"I _was_ coming round there, for I had to go to Flitton, and I thought I might as well take you in my way, and just let you know all I knew myself about the horse.</s> <s sid="80" id="silas.c8.s80">I suppose Master Dunsey didn't like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a bit.</s> <s sid="81" id="silas.c8.s81">He's perhaps gone to pay a visit at the Three Crowns, by Whitbridge--I know he's fond of the house."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="silas.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="silas.c8.s82"><qs/>"Perhaps he is,"<qe/> said Godfrey, rather absently.</s> <s sid="83" id="silas.c8.s83">Then rousing himself, he said, with an effort at carelessness, <qs/>"We shall hear of him soon enough, I'll be bound."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="silas.c8.p27" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="silas.c8.s84"><qs/>"Well, here's my turning,"<qe/><sls/> said Bryce, not surprised to perceive that Godfrey was rather "down"; <sle/><qs/>"so I'll bid you good-day, and wish I may bring you better news another time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="silas.c8.p28"><s sid="85" id="silas.c8.s85">Godfrey rode along slowly, representing to himself the scene of confession to his father from which he felt that there was now no longer any escape.</s> <s sid="86" id="silas.c8.s86">The revelation about the money must be made the very next morning; and if he withheld the rest, Dunstan would be sure to come back shortly, and, finding that he must bear the brunt of his father's anger, would tell the whole story out of spite, even though he had nothing to gain by it.</s> <s sid="87" id="silas.c8.s87">There was one step, perhaps, by which he might still win Dunstan's silence and put off the evil day: he might tell his father that he had himself spent the money paid to him by Fowler; and as he had never been guilty of such an offence before, the affair would blow over after a little storming.</s> <s sid="88" id="silas.c8.s88">But Godfrey could not bend himself to this.</s> <s sid="89" id="silas.c8.s89">He felt that in letting Dunstan have the money, he had already been guilty of a breach of trust hardly less culpable than that of spending the money directly for his own behoof; and yet there was a distinction between the two acts which made him feel that the one was so much more blackening than the other as to be intolerable to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="silas.c8.p29" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="silas.c8.s90"><qs/>"I don't pretend to be a good fellow,"<qe/><sss/> he said to himself; <sse/><qs/>"but I'm not a scoundrel--at least, I'll stop short somewhere.</s> <s sid="91" id="silas.c8.s91">I'll bear the consequences of what I _have_ done sooner than make believe I've done what I never would have done.</s> <s sid="92" id="silas.c8.s92">I'd never have spent the money for my own pleasure--I was tortured into it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="silas.c8.p30"><s sid="93" id="silas.c8.s93">Through the remainder of this day Godfrey, with only occasional fluctuations, kept his will bent in the direction of a complete avowal to his father, and he withheld the story of Wildfire's loss till the next morning, that it might serve him as an introduction to heavier matter.</s> <s sid="94" id="silas.c8.s94">The old Squire was accustomed to his son's frequent absence from home, and thought neither Dunstan's nor Wildfire's non-appearance a matter calling for remark.</s> <s sid="95" id="silas.c8.s95">Godfrey said to himself again and again, that if he let slip this one opportunity of confession, he might never have another; the revelation might be made even in a more odious way than by Dunstan's malignity:</s> <s sid="96" id="silas.c8.s96">_she_ might come as she had threatened to do.</s> <s sid="97" id="silas.c8.s97">And then he tried to make the scene easier to himself by rehearsal: he made up his mind how he would pass from the admission of his weakness in letting Dunstan have the money to the fact that Dunstan had a hold on him which he had been unable to shake off, and how he would work up his father to expect something very bad before he told him the fact.</s> <s sid="98" id="silas.c8.s98">The old Squire was an implacable man: he made resolutions in violent anger, and he was not to be moved from them after his anger had subsided--as fiery volcanic matters cool and harden into rock.</s> <s sid="99" id="silas.c8.s99">Like many violent and implacable men, he allowed evils to grow under favour of his own heedlessness, till they pressed upon him with exasperating force, and then he turned round with fierce severity and became unrelentingly hard.</s> <s sid="100" id="silas.c8.s100">This was his system with his tenants: he allowed them to get into arrears, neglect their fences, reduce their stock, sell their straw, and otherwise go the wrong way,--and then, when he became short of money in consequence of this indulgence, he took the hardest measures and would listen to no appeal.</s> <s sid="101" id="silas.c8.s101">Godfrey knew all this, and felt it with the greater force because he had constantly suffered annoyance from witnessing his father's sudden fits of unrelentingness, for which his own habitual irresolution deprived him of all sympathy.</s> <s sid="102" id="silas.c8.s102">(He was not critical on the faulty indulgence which preceded these fits; _that_ seemed to him natural enough.)</s> <s sid="103" id="silas.c8.s103">Still there was just the chance, Godfrey thought, that his father's pride might see this marriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up, rather than turn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten miles round.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="silas.c8.p31"><s sid="104" id="silas.c8.s104">This was the view of the case that Godfrey managed to keep before him pretty closely till midnight, and he went to sleep thinking that he had done with inward debating.</s> <s sid="105" id="silas.c8.s105">But when he awoke in the still morning darkness he found it impossible to reawaken his evening thoughts; it was as if they had been tired out and were not to be roused to further work.</s> <s sid="106" id="silas.c8.s106">Instead of arguments for confession, he could now feel the presence of nothing but its evil consequences: the old dread of disgrace came back--the old shrinking from the thought of raising a hopeless barrier between himself and Nancy--the old disposition to rely on chances which might be favourable to him, and save him from betrayal.</s> <s sid="107" id="silas.c8.s107">Why, after all, should he cut off the hope of them by his own act?</s> <s sid="108" id="silas.c8.s108">He had seen the matter in a wrong light yesterday.</s> <s sid="109" id="silas.c8.s109">He had been in a rage with Dunstan, and had thought of nothing but a thorough break-up of their mutual understanding; but what it would be really wisest for him to do, was to try and soften his father's anger against Dunsey, and keep things as nearly as possible in their old condition.</s> <s sid="110" id="silas.c8.s110">If Dunsey did not come back for a few days (and Godfrey did not know but that the rascal had enough money in his pocket to enable him to keep away still longer), everything might blow over.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="silas.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c9.s1">Godfrey rose and took his own breakfast earlier than usual, but lingered in the wainscoted parlour till his younger brothers had finished their meal and gone out; awaiting his father, who always took a walk with his managing-man before breakfast.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c9.s2">Every one breakfasted at a different hour in the Red House, and the Squire was always the latest, giving a long chance to a rather feeble morning appetite before he tried it.</s> <s sid="3" id="silas.c9.s3">The table had been spread with substantial eatables nearly two hours before he presented himself--a tall, stout man of sixty, with a face in which the knit brow and rather hard glance seemed contradicted by the slack and feeble mouth.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c9.s4">His person showed marks of habitual neglect, his dress was slovenly; and yet there was something in the presence of the old Squire distinguishable from that of the ordinary farmers in the parish, who were perhaps every whit as refined as he, but, having slouched their way through life with a consciousness of being in the vicinity of their "betters", wanted that self-possession and authoritativeness of voice and carriage which belonged to a man who thought of superiors as remote existences with whom he had personally little more to do than with America or the stars.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c9.s5">The Squire had been used to parish homage all his life, used to the presupposition that his family, his tankards, and everything that was his, were the oldest and best; and as he never associated with any gentry higher than himself, his opinion was not disturbed by comparison.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c11.p8"><s sid="25" id="silas.c11.s25">These dutiful questions and answers were continued until it was ascertained in detail that the Lammeters were all as well as usual, and the Osgoods likewise, also that niece Priscilla must certainly arrive shortly, and that travelling on pillions in snowy weather was unpleasant, though a joseph was a great protection.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c11.s26">Then Nancy was formally introduced to her aunt's visitors, the Miss Gunns, as being the daughters of a mother known to _their_ mother, though now for the first time induced to make a journey into these parts; and these ladies were so taken by surprise at finding such a lovely face and figure in an out-of-the-way country place, that they began to feel some curiosity about the dress she would put on when she took off her joseph.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c11.s27">Miss Nancy, whose thoughts were always conducted with the propriety and moderation conspicuous in her manners, remarked to herself that the Miss Gunns were rather hard-featured than otherwise, and that such very low dresses as they wore might have been attributed to vanity if their shoulders had been pretty, but that, being as they were, it was not reasonable to suppose that they showed their necks from a love of display, but rather from some obligation not inconsistent with sense and modesty.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c11.s28">She felt convinced, as she opened her box, that this must be her aunt Osgood's opinion, for Miss Nancy's mind resembled her aunt's to a degree that everybody said was surprising, considering the kinship was on Mr. Osgood's side; and though you might not have supposed it from the formality of their greeting, there was a devoted attachment and mutual admiration between aunt and niece.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c11.s29">Even Miss Nancy's refusal of her cousin Gilbert Osgood (on the ground solely that he was her cousin), though it had grieved her aunt greatly, had not in the least cooled the preference which had determined her to leave Nancy several of her hereditary ornaments, let Gilbert's future wife be whom she might.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c11.p9"><s sid="30" id="silas.c11.s30">Three of the ladies quickly retired, but the Miss Gunns were quite content that Mrs. Osgood's inclination to remain with her niece gave them also a reason for staying to see the rustic beauty's toilette.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c11.s31">And it was really a pleasure--from the first opening of the bandbox, where everything smelt of lavender and rose-leaves, to the clasping of the small coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck.</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c11.s32">Everything belonging to Miss Nancy was of delicate purity and nattiness: not a crease was where it had no business to be, not a bit of her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession; the very pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which she was careful to allow no aberration; and as for her own person, it gave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a little bird.</s> <s sid="33" id="silas.c11.s33">It is true that her light-brown hair was cropped behind like a boy's, and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings, that lay quite away from her face; but there was no sort of coiffure that could make Miss Nancy's cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty; and when at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk, her lace tucker, her coral necklace, and coral ear-drops, the Miss Gunns could see nothing to criticise except her hands, which bore the traces of butter-making, cheese-crushing, and even still coarser work.</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c11.s34">But Miss Nancy was not ashamed of that, for even while she was dressing she narrated to her aunt how she and Priscilla had packed their boxes yesterday, because this morning was baking morning, and since they were leaving home, it was desirable to make a good supply of meat-pies for the kitchen; and as she concluded this judicious remark, she turned to the Miss Gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including them in the conversation.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c11.s35">The Miss Gunns smiled stiffly, and thought what a pity it was that these rich country people, who could afford to buy such good clothes (really Miss Nancy's lace and silk were very costly), should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity.</s> <s sid="36" id="silas.c11.s36">She actually said "mate" for "meat", "'appen" for "perhaps", and "oss" for "horse", which, to young ladies living in good Lytherly society, who habitually said 'orse, even in domestic privacy, and only said 'appen on the right occasions, was necessarily shocking.</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c11.s37">Miss Nancy, indeed, had never been to any school higher than Dame Tedman's: her acquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she had worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess; and in order to balance an account, she was obliged to effect her subtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a visible metallic total.</s> <s sid="38" id="silas.c11.s38">There is hardly a servant-maid in these days who is not better informed than Miss Nancy; yet she had the essential attributes of a lady--high veracity, delicate honour in her dealings, deference to others, and refined personal habits,--and lest these should not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at all resemble theirs, I will add that she was slightly proud and exacting, and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion as towards an erring lover.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="silas.c11.p27"><s sid="91" id="silas.c11.s91">Places of honour had been kept for the Miss Lammeters near the head of the principal tea-table in the wainscoted parlour, now looking fresh and pleasant with handsome branches of holly, yew, and laurel, from the abundant growths of the old garden; and Nancy felt an inward flutter, that no firmness of purpose could prevent, when she saw Mr. Godfrey Cass advancing to lead her to a seat between himself and Mr. Crackenthorp, while Priscilla was called to the opposite side between her father and the Squire.</s> <s sid="92" id="silas.c11.s92">It certainly did make some difference to Nancy that the lover she had given up was the young man of quite the highest consequence in the parish--at home in a venerable and unique parlour, which was the extremity of grandeur in her experience, a parlour where _she_ might one day have been mistress, with the consciousness that she was spoken of as "Madam Cass", the Squire's wife.</s> <s sid="93" id="silas.c11.s93">These circumstances exalted her inward drama in her own eyes, and deepened the emphasis with which she declared to herself that not the most dazzling rank should induce her to marry a man whose conduct showed him careless of his character, but that, "love once, love always", was the motto of a true and pure woman, and no man should ever have any right over her which would be a call on her to destroy the dried flowers that she treasured, and always would treasure, for Godfrey Cass's sake.</s> <s sid="94" id="silas.c11.s94">And Nancy was capable of keeping her word to herself under very trying conditions.</s> <s sid="95" id="silas.c11.s95">Nothing but a becoming blush betrayed the moving thoughts that urged themselves upon her as she accepted the seat next to Mr. Crackenthorp; for she was so instinctively neat and adroit in all her actions, and her pretty lips met each other with such quiet firmness, that it would have been difficult for her to appear agitated.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="silas.c11.p30"><s sid="99" id="silas.c11.s99">Godfrey made no reply, and avoided looking at Nancy very markedly; for though these complimentary personalities were held to be in excellent taste in old-fashioned Raveloe society, reverent love has a politeness of its own which it teaches to men otherwise of small schooling.</s> <s sid="100" id="silas.c11.s100">But the Squire was rather impatient at Godfrey's showing himself a dull spark in this way.</s> <s sid="101" id="silas.c11.s101">By this advanced hour of the day, the Squire was always in higher spirits than we have seen him in at the breakfast-table, and felt it quite pleasant to fulfil the hereditary duty of being noisily jovial and patronizing: the large silver snuff-box was in active service and was offered without fail to all neighbours from time to time, however often they might have declined the favour.</s> <s sid="102" id="silas.c11.s102">At present, the Squire had only given an express welcome to the heads of families as they appeared; but always as the evening deepened, his hospitality rayed out more widely, till he had tapped the youngest guests on the back and shown a peculiar fondness for their presence, in the full belief that they must feel their lives made happy by their belonging to a parish where there was such a hearty man as Squire Cass to invite them and wish them well.</s> <s sid="103" id="silas.c11.s103">Even in this early stage of the jovial mood, it was natural that he should wish to supply his son's deficiencies by looking and speaking for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="silas.c11.p33"><s sid="108" id="silas.c11.s108">This emphatic compliment of the Squire's to Nancy was felt by others besides Godfrey to have a diplomatic significance; and her father gave a slight additional erectness to his back, as he looked across the table at her with complacent gravity.</s> <s sid="109" id="silas.c11.s109">That grave and orderly senior was not going to bate a jot of his dignity by seeming elated at the notion of a match between his family and the Squire's: he was gratified by any honour paid to his daughter; but he must see an alteration in several ways before his consent would be vouchsafed.</s> <s sid="110" id="silas.c11.s110">His spare but healthy person, and high-featured firm face, that looked as if it had never been flushed by excess, was in strong contrast, not only with the Squire's, but with the appearance of the Raveloe farmers generally--in accordance with a favourite saying of his own, that "breed was stronger than pasture".</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c12.p3"><s sid="11" id="silas.c12.s11">She had set out at an early hour, but had lingered on the road, inclined by her indolence to believe that if she waited under a warm shed the snow would cease to fall.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c12.s12">She had waited longer than she knew, and now that she found herself belated in the snow-hidden ruggedness of the long lanes, even the animation of a vindictive purpose could not keep her spirit from failing.</s> <s sid="13" id="silas.c12.s13">It was seven o'clock, and by this time she was not very far from Raveloe, but she was not familiar enough with those monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journey's end.</s> <s sid="14" id="silas.c12.s14">She needed comfort, and she knew but one comforter--the familiar demon in her bosom; but she hesitated a moment, after drawing out the black remnant, before she raised it to her lips.</s> <s sid="15" id="silas.c12.s15">In that moment the mother's love pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivion--pleaded to be left in aching weariness, rather than to have the encircling arms benumbed so that they could not feel the dear burden.</s> <s sid="16" id="silas.c12.s16">In another moment Molly had flung something away, but it was not the black remnant--it was an empty phial.</s> <s sid="17" id="silas.c12.s17">And she walked on again under the breaking cloud, from which there came now and then the light of a quickly veiled star, for a freezing wind had sprung up since the snowing had ceased.</s> <s sid="18" id="silas.c12.s18">But she walked always more and more drowsily, and clutched more and more automatically the sleeping child at her bosom.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="silas.c12.p4"><s sid="19" id="silas.c12.s19">Slowly the demon was working his will, and cold and weariness were his helpers.</s> <s sid="20" id="silas.c12.s20">Soon she felt nothing but a supreme immediate longing that curtained off all futurity--the longing to lie down and sleep.</s> <s sid="21" id="silas.c12.s21">She had arrived at a spot where her footsteps were no longer checked by a hedgerow, and she had wandered vaguely, unable to distinguish any objects, notwithstanding the wide whiteness around her, and the growing starlight.</s> <s sid="22" id="silas.c12.s22">She sank down against a straggling furze bush, an easy pillow enough; and the bed of snow, too, was soft.</s> <s sid="23" id="silas.c12.s23">She did not feel that the bed was cold, and did not heed whether the child would wake and cry for her.</s> <s sid="24" id="silas.c12.s24">But her arms had not yet relaxed their instinctive clutch; and the little one slumbered on as gently as if it had been rocked in a lace-trimmed cradle.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="silas.c12.p5"><s sid="25" id="silas.c12.s25">But the complete torpor came at last: the fingers lost their tension, the arms unbent; then the little head fell away from the bosom, and the blue eyes opened wide on the cold starlight.</s> <s sid="26" id="silas.c12.s26">At first there was a little peevish cry of "mammy", and an effort to regain the pillowing arm and bosom; but mammy's ear was deaf, and the pillow seemed to be slipping away backward.</s> <s sid="27" id="silas.c12.s27">Suddenly, as the child rolled downward on its mother's knees, all wet with snow, its eyes were caught by a bright glancing light on the white ground, and, with the ready transition of infancy, it was immediately absorbed in watching the bright living thing running towards it, yet never arriving.</s> <s sid="28" id="silas.c12.s28">That bright living thing must be caught; and in an instant the child had slipped on all-fours, and held out one little hand to catch the gleam.</s> <s sid="29" id="silas.c12.s29">But the gleam would not be caught in that way, and now the head was held up to see where the cunning gleam came from.</s> <s sid="30" id="silas.c12.s30">It came from a very bright place; and the little one, rising on its legs, toddled through the snow, the old grimy shawl in which it was wrapped trailing behind it, and the queer little bonnet dangling at its back--toddled on to the open door of Silas Marner's cottage, and right up to the warm hearth, where there was a bright fire of logs and sticks, which had thoroughly warmed the old sack (Silas's greatcoat) spread out on the bricks to dry.</s> <s sid="31" id="silas.c12.s31">The little one, accustomed to be left to itself for long hours without notice from its mother, squatted down on the sack, and spread its tiny hands towards the blaze, in perfect contentment, gurgling and making many inarticulate communications to the cheerful fire, like a new-hatched gosling beginning to find itself comfortable.</s> <s sid="32" id="silas.c12.s32">But presently the warmth had a lulling effect, and the little golden head sank down on the old sack, and the blue eyes were veiled by their delicate half-transparent lids.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="silas.c12.p6"><s sid="33" id="silas.c12.s33">But where was Silas Marner while this strange visitor had come to his hearth?</s> <s sid="34" id="silas.c12.s34">He was in the cottage, but he did not see the child.</s> <s sid="35" id="silas.c12.s35">During the last few weeks, since he had lost his money, he had contracted the habit of opening his door and looking out from time to time, as if he thought that his money might be somehow coming back to him, or that some trace, some news of it, might be mysteriously on the road, and be caught by the listening ear or the straining eye.</s> <s sid="36" id="silas.c12.s36">It was chiefly at night, when he was not occupied in his loom, that he fell into this repetition of an act for which he could have assigned no definite purpose, and which can hardly be understood except by those who have undergone a bewildering separation from a supremely loved object.</s> <s sid="37" id="silas.c12.s37">In the evening twilight, and later whenever the night was not dark, Silas looked out on that narrow prospect round the Stone-pits, listening and gazing, not with hope, but with mere yearning and unrest.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="silas.c12.p7"><s sid="38" id="silas.c12.s38">This morning he had been told by some of his neighbours that it was New Year's Eve, and that he must sit up and hear the old year rung out and the new rung in, because that was good luck, and might bring his money back again.</s> <s sid="39" id="silas.c12.s39">This was only a friendly Raveloe-way of jesting with the half-crazy oddities of a miser, but it had perhaps helped to throw Silas into a more than usually excited state.</s> <s sid="40" id="silas.c12.s40">Since the on-coming of twilight he had opened his door again and again, though only to shut it immediately at seeing all distance veiled by the falling snow.</s> <s sid="41" id="silas.c12.s41">But the last time he opened it the snow had ceased, and the clouds were parting here and there.</s> <s sid="42" id="silas.c12.s42">He stood and listened, and gazed for a long while--there was really something on the road coming towards him then, but he caught no sign of it; and the stillness and the wide trackless snow seemed to narrow his solitude, and touched his yearning with the chill of despair.</s> <s sid="43" id="silas.c12.s43">He went in again, and put his right hand on the latch of the door to close it--but he did not close it: he was arrested, as he had been already since his loss, by the invisible wand of catalepsy, and stood like a graven image, with wide but sightless eyes, holding open his door, powerless to resist either the good or the evil that might enter there.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="silas.c12.p8"><s sid="44" id="silas.c12.s44">When Marner's sensibility returned, he continued the action which had been arrested, and closed his door, unaware of the chasm in his consciousness, unaware of any intermediate change, except that the light had grown dim, and that he was chilled and faint.</s> <s sid="45" id="silas.c12.s45">He thought he had been too long standing at the door and looking out.</s> <s sid="46" id="silas.c12.s46">Turning towards the hearth, where the two logs had fallen apart, and sent forth only a red uncertain glimmer, he seated himself on his fireside chair, and was stooping to push his logs together, when, to his blurred vision, it seemed as if there were gold on the floor in front of the hearth.</s> <s sid="47" id="silas.c12.s47">Gold!--his own gold--brought back to him as mysteriously as it had been taken away!</s> <s sid="48" id="silas.c12.s48">He felt his heart begin to beat violently, and for a few moments he was unable to stretch out his hand and grasp the restored treasure.</s> <s sid="49" id="silas.c12.s49">The heap of gold seemed to glow and get larger beneath his agitated gaze.</s> <s sid="50" id="silas.c12.s50">He leaned forward at last, and stretched forth his hand; but instead of the hard coin with the familiar resisting outline, his fingers encountered soft warm curls.</s> <s sid="51" id="silas.c12.s51">In utter amazement, Silas fell on his knees and bent his head low to examine the marvel: it was a sleeping child--a round, fair thing, with soft yellow rings all over its head.</s> <s sid="52" id="silas.c12.s52">Could this be his little sister come back to him in a dream--his little sister whom he had carried about in his arms for a year before she died, when he was a small boy without shoes or stockings?</s> <s sid="53" id="silas.c12.s53">That was the first thought that darted across Silas's blank wonderment.</s> <s sid="54" id="silas.c12.s54">_Was_ it a dream?</s> <s sid="55" id="silas.c12.s55">He rose to his feet again, pushed his logs together, and, throwing on some dried leaves and sticks, raised a flame; but the flame did not disperse the vision--it only lit up more distinctly the little round form of the child, and its shabby clothing.</s> <s sid="56" id="silas.c12.s56">It was very much like his little sister.</s> <s sid="57" id="silas.c12.s57">Silas sank into his chair powerless, under the double presence of an inexplicable surprise and a hurrying influx of memories.</s> <s sid="58" id="silas.c12.s58">How and when had the child come in without his knowledge?</s> <s sid="59" id="silas.c12.s59">He had never been beyond the door.</s> <s sid="60" id="silas.c12.s60">But along with that question, and almost thrusting it away, there was a vision of the old home and the old streets leading to Lantern Yard--and within that vision another, of the thoughts which had been present with him in those far-off scenes.</s> <s sid="61" id="silas.c12.s61">The thoughts were strange to him now, like old friendships impossible to revive; and yet he had a dreamy feeling that this child was somehow a message come to him from that far-off life: it stirred fibres that had never been moved in Raveloe--old quiverings of tenderness--old impressions of awe at the presentiment of some Power presiding over his life; for his imagination had not yet extricated itself from the sense of mystery in the child's sudden presence, and had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by which the event could have been brought about.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="silas.c12.p9"><s sid="62" id="silas.c12.s62">But there was a cry on the hearth: the child had awaked, and Marner stooped to lift it on his knee.</s> <s sid="63" id="silas.c12.s63">It clung round his neck, and burst louder and louder into that mingling of inarticulate cries with "mammy" by which little children express the bewilderment of waking.</s> <s sid="64" id="silas.c12.s64">Silas pressed it to him, and almost unconsciously uttered sounds of hushing tenderness, while he bethought himself that some of his porridge, which had got cool by the dying fire, would do to feed the child with if it were only warmed up a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="silas.c12.p10" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="silas.c12.s65">He had plenty to do through the next hour.</s> <s sid="66" id="silas.c12.s66">The porridge, sweetened with some dry brown sugar from an old store which he had refrained from using for himself, stopped the cries of the little one, and made her lift her blue eyes with a wide quiet gaze at Silas, as he put the spoon into her mouth.</s> <s sid="67" id="silas.c12.s67">Presently she slipped from his knee and began to toddle about, but with a pretty stagger that made Silas jump up and follow her lest she should fall against anything that would hurt her.</s> <s sid="68" id="silas.c12.s68">But she only fell in a sitting posture on the ground, and began to pull at her boots, looking up at him with a crying face as if the boots hurt her.</s> <s sid="69" id="silas.c12.s69">He took her on his knee again, but it was some time before it occurred to Silas's dull bachelor mind that the wet boots were the grievance, pressing on her warm ankles.</s> <s sid="70" id="silas.c12.s70">He got them off with difficulty, and baby was at once happily occupied with the primary mystery of her own toes, inviting Silas, with much chuckling, to consider the mystery too.</s> <s sid="71" id="silas.c12.s71">But the wet boots had at last suggested to Silas that the child had been walking on the snow, and this roused him from his entire oblivion of any ordinary means by which it could have entered or been brought into his house.</s> <s sid="72" id="silas.c12.s72">Under the prompting of this new idea, and without waiting to form conjectures, he raised the child in his arms, and went to the door.</s> <s sid="73" id="silas.c12.s73">As soon as he had opened it, there was the cry of "mammy" again, which Silas had not heard since the child's first hungry waking.</s> <s sid="74" id="silas.c12.s74">Bending forward, he could just discern the marks made by the little feet on the virgin snow, and he followed their track to the furze bushes.</s> <s sid="75" id="silas.c12.s75"><qs/>"Mammy!"<qe/>  the little one cried again and again, stretching itself forward so as almost to escape from Silas's arms, before he himself was aware that there was something more than the bush before him--that there was a human body, with the head sunk low in the furze, and half-covered with the shaken snow.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="silas.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="silas.c13.s1">It was after the early supper-time at the Red House, and the entertainment was in that stage when bashfulness itself had passed into easy jollity, when gentlemen, conscious of unusual accomplishments, could at length be prevailed on to dance a hornpipe, and when the Squire preferred talking loudly, scattering snuff, and patting his visitors' backs, to sitting longer at the whist-table--a choice exasperating to uncle Kimble, who, being always volatile in sober business hours, became intense and bitter over cards and brandy, shuffled before his adversary's deal with a glare of suspicion, and turned up a mean trump-card with an air of inexpressible disgust, as if in a world where such things could happen one might as well enter on a course of reckless profligacy.</s> <s sid="2" id="silas.c13.s2">When the evening had advanced to this pitch of freedom and enjoyment, it was usual for the servants, the heavy duties of supper being well over, to get their share of amusement by coming to look on at the dancing; so that the back regions of the house were left in solitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="silas.c13.p2"><s sid="3" id="silas.c13.s3">There were two doors by which the White Parlour was entered from the hall, and they were both standing open for the sake of air; but the lower one was crowded with the servants and villagers, and only the upper doorway was left free.</s> <s sid="4" id="silas.c13.s4">Bob Cass was figuring in a hornpipe, and his father, very proud of this lithe son, whom he repeatedly declared to be just like himself in his young days in a tone that implied this to be the very highest stamp of juvenile merit, was the centre of a group who had placed themselves opposite the performer, not far from the upper door.</s> <s sid="5" id="silas.c13.s5">Godfrey was standing a little way off, not to admire his brother's dancing, but to keep sight of Nancy, who was seated in the group, near her father.</s> <s sid="6" id="silas.c13.s6">He stood aloof, because he wished to avoid suggesting himself as a subject for the Squire's fatherly jokes in connection with matrimony and Miss Nancy Lammeter's beauty, which were likely to become more and more explicit.</s> <s sid="7" id="silas.c13.s7">But he had the prospect of dancing with her again when the hornpipe was concluded, and in the meanwhile it was very pleasant to get long glances at her quite unobserved.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="silas.c13.p3"><s sid="8" id="silas.c13.s8">But when Godfrey was lifting his eyes from one of those long glances, they encountered an object as startling to him at that moment as if it had been an apparition from the dead.</s> <s sid="9" id="silas.c13.s9">It _was_ an apparition from that hidden life which lies, like a dark by-street, behind the goodly ornamented facade that meets the sunlight and the gaze of respectable admirers.</s> <s sid="10" id="silas.c13.s10">It was his own child, carried in Silas Marner's arms.</s> <s sid="11" id="silas.c13.s11">That was his instantaneous impression, unaccompanied by doubt, though he had not seen the child for months past; and when the hope was rising that he might possibly be mistaken, Mr. Crackenthorp and Mr. Lammeter had already advanced to Silas, in astonishment at this strange advent.</s> <s sid="12" id="silas.c13.s12">Godfrey joined them immediately, unable to rest without hearing every word--trying to control himself, but conscious that if any one noticed him, they must see that he was white-lipped and trembling.</s> </p>
