<p pid="2" id="tapestry.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="tapestry.c1.s3">It was so cold.</s> <s sid="4" id="tapestry.c1.s4">Ah, so very cold!</s> <s sid="5" id="tapestry.c1.s5">So thought the old raven as he hobbled up and down the terrace walk at the back of the house--the walk that was so pleasant in summer, with its pretty view of the lower garden, gay with the bright, stiffly-arranged flowerbeds, so pleasantly warm and yet shady with the old trees overhead, where the raven's second cousins, the rooks, managed their affairs, not without a good deal of chatter about it, it must be confessed.</s> <s sid="6" id="tapestry.c1.s6"><qs/>"Silly creatures,"<qe/> the raven was in the habit of calling them with contempt--all to himself, of course, for no one understood the different tones of his croaking, even though he was a French raven and had received the best of educations.</s> <s sid="7" id="tapestry.c1.s7">But to-day he was too depressed in spirit by the cold to think of his relations or their behaviour at all.</s> <s sid="8" id="tapestry.c1.s8">He just hopped or hobbled--I hardly know which you would call it--slowly and solemnly up and down the long walk, where the snow lay so thick that at each hop it came ever so far up his black claws, which annoyed him very much, I assure you, and made him wish more than ever that summer was back again.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="tapestry.c1.p3"><s sid="9" id="tapestry.c1.s9">Poor old fellow! he was not usually of a discontented disposition; but to-day, it must be allowed, he was in the right about the cold.</s> <s sid="10" id="tapestry.c1.s10">It was _very_ cold.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="tapestry.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="tapestry.c1.s11">Several others beside the raven were thinking so--the three chickens who lived in a queer little house in one corner of the yard thought so, and huddled the closer together, as they settled themselves for the night.</s> <s sid="12" id="tapestry.c1.s12">For though it was only half-past three in the afternoon, they thought it was no use sitting up any longer on such a make-believe of a day, when not the least little ray of sunshine had succeeded in creeping through the leaden-grey sky.</s> <s sid="13" id="tapestry.c1.s13">And the tortoise _would_ have thought so too if he could, but he was too sleepy to think at all, as he "cruddled" himself into his shell in the corner of the laurel hedge, and dreamt of the nice hot days that were past.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="tapestry.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="tapestry.c1.s14">And upstairs, inside the old house, somebody else was thinking so too--a little somebody who seemed to be doing her best to make herself, particularly her nose, colder still, for she was pressing it hard on to the icy window-pane and staring out on to the deserted, snow-covered garden, and thinking how cold it was, and wishing it was summer time again, and fancying how it would feel to be a raven like old <qs/>"Dudu,"<qe/> all at once, in the mixed-up, dancing-about way that "thinking" was generally done in the funny little brain of Mademoiselle Jeanne.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tapestry.c1.p6"><s sid="15" id="tapestry.c1.s15">Inside the room it was getting dark, and the white snow outside seemed to make it darker.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="tapestry.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="tapestry.c1.s16"><qs/>"Mademoiselle Jeanne,"<qe/><sls/> said a voice belonging to a servant who just then opened the door; <sle/><qs/>"Mademoiselle Jeanne, what are you doing at the window?</s> <s sid="17" id="tapestry.c1.s17">You will catch cold."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tapestry.c1.p8"><s sid="18" id="tapestry.c1.s18">Jeanne gave a little start when she heard herself spoken to.</s> <s sid="19" id="tapestry.c1.s19">She had been all alone in the room for some time, with not a sound about her.</s> <s sid="20" id="tapestry.c1.s20">She turned slowly from the window and came near the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tapestry.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="tapestry.c1.s21"><qs/>"If I did catch cold, it would not be bad,"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="22" id="tapestry.c1.s22"><qs/>"I would stay in bed, and you, Marcelline, would make me nice things to eat, and nobody would say, <alt-qs/>'Don't do that, Mademoiselle.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="tapestry.c1.s23">It would be charming."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tapestry.c1.p10"><s sid="24" id="tapestry.c1.s24">Marcelline was Jeanne's old nurse, and she had been her mother's nurse too.</s> <s sid="25" id="tapestry.c1.s25">She was really rather old, how old nobody seemed exactly to know, but Jeanne thought her _very_ old, and asked her once if she had not been her grandmother's nurse too.</s> <s sid="26" id="tapestry.c1.s26">Any one else but Marcelline would have been offended at such a question; but Marcelline was not like any one else, and she never was offended at anything.</s> <s sid="27" id="tapestry.c1.s27">She was so old that for many years no one had seen much difference in her--she had reached a sort of settled oldness, like an arm-chair which may once have been covered with bright-coloured silk, but which, with time and wear, has got to have an all-over-old look which never seems to get any worse.</s> <s sid="28" id="tapestry.c1.s28">Not that Marcelline was dull or grey to look at--she was bright and cheery, and when she had a new clean cap on, all beautifully frilled and crimped round her face, Jeanne used to tell her that she was beautiful, quite beautiful, and that if she was _very_ good and always did exactly what Jeanne asked her, she--Jeanne--would have her to be nurse to her children when she had grown up to be a lady, married to some very nice gentleman.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tapestry.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="tapestry.c1.s29">And when Jeanne chattered like that, Marcelline used to smile; she never said anything, she just smiled.</s> <s sid="30" id="tapestry.c1.s30">Sometimes Jeanne liked to see her smile; sometimes it would make her impatient, and she would say, <qs/>"Why do you smile like that, Marcelline?</s> <s sid="31" id="tapestry.c1.s31">_Speak!_ When I speak I like you to speak too."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tapestry.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="tapestry.c1.s32">But all she could get Marcelline to answer would be, <qs/>"Well, Mademoiselle, it is very well what you say."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="tapestry.c1.p13"><s sid="33" id="tapestry.c1.s33">This evening--or perhaps I should say afternoon, for whatever hour the chickens' timepiece made it, it was only half-past three by the great big clock that stood at the end of the long passage by Jeanne's room door;--this afternoon Jeanne was not quite as lively as she sometimes was.</s> <s sid="34" id="tapestry.c1.s34">She sat down on the floor in front of the fire and stared into it.</s> <s sid="35" id="tapestry.c1.s35">It was pretty to look at just then, for the wood was burning redly, and at the tiniest touch a whole bevy of lovely sparks would fly out like bees from a hive, or a covey of birds, or better still, like a thousand imprisoned fairies escaping at some magic touch.</s> <s sid="36" id="tapestry.c1.s36">Of all things, Jeanne loved to give this magic touch.</s> <s sid="37" id="tapestry.c1.s37">There was no poker, but she managed just as well with a stick of unburnt wood, or sometimes, when she was _quite_ sure Marcelline was not looking, with the toe of her little shoe.</s> <s sid="38" id="tapestry.c1.s38">Just now it was Marcelline who set the fairy sparks free by moving the logs a little and putting on a fresh one behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="tapestry.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="tapestry.c1.s39"><qs/>"How pretty they are, are they not, Marcelline?"<qe/> said Jeanne.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tapestry.c1.p15"><s sid="40" id="tapestry.c1.s40">Marcelline did not speak, and when Jeanne looked up at her, she saw by the light of the fire that she was smiling.</s> <s sid="41" id="tapestry.c1.s41">Jeanne held up her forefinger.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="tapestry.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="tapestry.c1.s42"><qs/>"Naughty Marcelline,"<qe/><sss/> she said; <sse/><qs/>"you are not to smile.</s> <s sid="43" id="tapestry.c1.s43">You are to _speak_.</s> <s sid="44" id="tapestry.c1.s44">I want you to speak very much, for it is so dull, and I have nothing to do.</s> <s sid="45" id="tapestry.c1.s45">I want you to tell me stories, Marcelline.</s> <s sid="46" id="tapestry.c1.s46">Do you hear, you naughty little thing?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tapestry.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="tapestry.c1.s47"><qs/>"And what am I to tell you stories about then, Mademoiselle?</s> <s sid="48" id="tapestry.c1.s48">You have got all out of my old head long ago; and when the grain is all ground what can the miller do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tapestry.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="tapestry.c1.s49"><qs/>"Get some more, of course,"<qe/> said Jeanne.</s> <s sid="50" id="tapestry.c1.s50"><qs/>"Why, _I_ could make stories if I tried, I daresay, and I am only seven, and you who are a hundred--are you _quite_ a hundred, Marcelline?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tapestry.c1.p19"><s sid="51" id="tapestry.c1.s51">Marcelline shook her head.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="tapestry.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="tapestry.c1.s52"><qs/>"Not _quite_, Mademoiselle,"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tapestry.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="tapestry.c1.s53"><qs/>"Well, never mind, you are old enough to make stories, any way.</s> <s sid="54" id="tapestry.c1.s54">Tell me more about the country where you lived when you were little as I; the country you will never tell me the name of.</s> <s sid="55" id="tapestry.c1.s55">Oh, I do like that one about the Golden Princess shut up in the castle by the sea!</s> <s sid="56" id="tapestry.c1.s56">I like stories about princesses best of all.</s> <s sid="57" id="tapestry.c1.s57">I do wish I were a princess; next to my best wish of all, I wish to be a princess.</s> <s sid="58" id="tapestry.c1.s58">Marcelline, do you hear?</s> <s sid="59" id="tapestry.c1.s59">I want you to tell me a story."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tapestry.c1.p22"><s sid="60" id="tapestry.c1.s60">Still Marcelline did not reply.</s> <s sid="61" id="tapestry.c1.s61">She in her turn was looking into the fire.</s> <s sid="62" id="tapestry.c1.s62">Suddenly she spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tapestry.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="tapestry.c1.s63"><qs/>"One, two, three,"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="64" id="tapestry.c1.s64"><qs/>"Quick, now, Mademoiselle, quick, quick.</s> <s sid="65" id="tapestry.c1.s65">Wish a wish before that last spark is gone.</s> <s sid="66" id="tapestry.c1.s66">Quick, Mademoiselle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tapestry.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="tapestry.c1.s67"><qs/>"Oh dear, what shall I wish?"<qe/> exclaimed Jeanne.</s> <s sid="68" id="tapestry.c1.s68"><qs/>"When you tell me to be quick it all goes out of my head; but I know now.</s> <s sid="69" id="tapestry.c1.s69">I wish----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tapestry.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="tapestry.c1.s70"><qs/>"Hush, Mademoiselle,"<qe/> said Marcelline, quickly again.</s> <s sid="71" id="tapestry.c1.s71"><qs/>"You must not say it aloud.</s> <s sid="72" id="tapestry.c1.s72">Never mind, it is all right.</s> <s sid="73" id="tapestry.c1.s73">You have wished it before the spark is gone.</s> <s sid="74" id="tapestry.c1.s74">It will come true, Mademoiselle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tapestry.c1.p26"><s sid="75" id="tapestry.c1.s75">Jeanne's bright dark eyes glanced up at Marcelline with an expression of mingled curiosity and respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tapestry.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="tapestry.c1.s76"><qs/>"How do you know it will come true?"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tapestry.c1.p28"><s sid="77" id="tapestry.c1.s77">Marcelline's old eyes, nearly as bright and dark still as Jeanne's own, had a half-mischievous look in them as she replied, solemnly shaking her head,</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tapestry.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="tapestry.c1.s78"><qs/>"I know, Mademoiselle, and that is all I can say.</s> <s sid="79" id="tapestry.c1.s79">And when the time comes for your wish to be granted, you will see if I am not right."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tapestry.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="tapestry.c1.s80"><qs/>"Shall I?"<qe/> said Jeanne, half impressed, half rebellious.</s> <s sid="81" id="tapestry.c1.s81"><qs/>"Do the fairies tell you things, Marcelline?</s> <s sid="82" id="tapestry.c1.s82">Not that I believe there are any fairies--not now, any way."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tapestry.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="tapestry.c1.s83"><qs/>"Don't say that, Mademoiselle,"<qe/> said Marcelline.</s> <s sid="84" id="tapestry.c1.s84"><qs/>"In that country I have told you of no one ever said such a thing as that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tapestry.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="tapestry.c1.s85"><qs/>"Why didn't they?</s> <s sid="86" id="tapestry.c1.s86">Did they really _see_ fairies there?"<qe/> asked Jeanne, lowering her voice a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tapestry.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="tapestry.c1.s87"><qs/>"Perhaps,"<qe/> said Marcelline; but that was all she _would_ say, and Jeanne couldn't get her to tell her any fairy stories, and had to content herself with making them for herself instead out of the queer shapes of the burning wood of the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tapestry.c1.p34"><s sid="88" id="tapestry.c1.s88">She was so busy with these fancies that she did not hear the stopping of the click-click of Marcelline's knitting needles, nor did she hear the old nurse get up from her chair and go out of the room.</s> <s sid="89" id="tapestry.c1.s89">A few minutes before, the _facteur_ had rung at the great wooden gates of the courtyard--a rather rare event, for in those days letters came only twice a week--but this, too, little Jeanne had not heard.</s> <s sid="90" id="tapestry.c1.s90">She must have grown drowsy with the quiet and the heat of the fire, for she quite started when the door again opened, and Marcelline's voice told her that her mother wanted her to go down to the salon, she had something to say to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="tapestry.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="tapestry.c1.s91"><qs/>"O Marcelline,"<qe/><sls/> said Jeanne, rubbing her eyes, <sle/><qs/>"I didn't know you had gone away.</s> <s sid="92" id="tapestry.c1.s92">What does mamma want?</s> <s sid="93" id="tapestry.c1.s93">O Marcelline, I am so sleepy, I would like to go to bed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="tapestry.c1.p41"><s sid="109" id="tapestry.c1.s109">She would say no more, but smoothed Jeanne's soft dark hair, never very untidy it must be owned, for it was always neatly plaited in two tails that hung down her back, as was then the fashion for little girls of Jeanne's age and country, and bade her again not to delay going downstairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="tapestry.c1.p42"><s sid="110" id="tapestry.c1.s110">Jeanne set off.</s> <s sid="111" id="tapestry.c1.s111">In that great rambling old house it was really quite a journey from her room to her mother's salon.</s> <s sid="112" id="tapestry.c1.s112">There was the long corridor to pass, at one end of which were Jeanne's quarters, at the other a room which had had for her since her babyhood a mingled fascination and awe.</s> <s sid="113" id="tapestry.c1.s113">It was hung with tapestry, very old, and in some parts faded, but still distinct.</s> <s sid="114" id="tapestry.c1.s114">As Jeanne passed by the door of this room, she noticed that it was open, and the gleam of the faint moonlight on the snow-covered garden outside attracted her.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="tapestry.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="tapestry.c1.s115"><qs/>"I can see the terrace ever so much better from the tapestry room window,"<qe/> she said to herself.</s> <s sid="116" id="tapestry.c1.s116"><qs/>"I wonder what Dudu is doing, poor old fellow.</s> <s sid="117" id="tapestry.c1.s117">Oh, how cold he must be!</s> <s sid="118" id="tapestry.c1.s118">I suppose Grignan is asleep in a hole in the hedge, and the chickens will be all right any way.</s> <s sid="119" id="tapestry.c1.s119">I have not seen Houpet all day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="tapestry.c4.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="tapestry.c4.s14"><qs/>"I should like to go,"<qe/> replied Hugh, thinking it wiser, all things considered, to get over his offended feelings.</s> <s sid="15" id="tapestry.c4.s15"><qs/>"I should like to see the castle very much, though I should have liked Jeanne to be with me; but still,"<qe/><sls/> he went on, reflecting that Jeanne would be extremely disappointed if he did not make the most of his present opportunity, such as it was, <sle/><qs/>"if you will be so kind as to show me the way, Monsieur Dudu, I'd like to go, and then, any way, I can tell Jeanne all about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="tapestry.c4.p8" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="tapestry.c4.s19">He held out his claw, on the end of which hung, by a narrow ribbon, two round little cushions about the size of a macaroon biscuit.</s> <s sid="20" id="tapestry.c4.s20">Hugh took them, and examined them curiously.</s> <s sid="21" id="tapestry.c4.s21">They were soft and elastic, what Hugh in his own words would have described as <qs/>"blobby."<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="tapestry.c4.s22">They seemed to be made of some stuff like indiarubber, and were just the colour of his skin.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="tapestry.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="tapestry.c4.s23"><qs/>"What funny things!"<qe/> said Hugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="tapestry.c4.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="tapestry.c4.s24"><qs/>"They are made after the pattern of the fly's wall-climbers,"<qe/> remarked the raven.</s> <s sid="25" id="tapestry.c4.s25"><qs/>"Put them on--tie them on, that is to say, so that they will be just in the middle of your foot, underneath of course.</s> <s sid="26" id="tapestry.c4.s26">That's right; now jump out of bed and follow me,"<qe/> and before Hugh knew what he was doing he found himself walking with the greatest ease straight up the wall to where the long flight of steps to the tapestry castle began.</s> <s sid="27" id="tapestry.c4.s27">On the lowest steps the raven stopped a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="tapestry.c4.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="tapestry.c4.s28"><qs/>"Shall I take them off now?"<qe/> asked Hugh.</s> <s sid="29" id="tapestry.c4.s29"><qs/>"I don't need them to walk up steps with."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="tapestry.c4.p12" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="tapestry.c4.s30"><qs/>"Take them off?"<qe/><sss/> said the raven; <sse/><qs/>"oh dear no.</s> <s sid="31" id="tapestry.c4.s31">When you don't need them they won't incommode you, and they'll be all ready for the next time.</s> <s sid="32" id="tapestry.c4.s32">Besides, though it mayn't seem so to you, these steps are not so easy to get up as you think.</s> <s sid="33" id="tapestry.c4.s33">At least they wouldn't be without the wall-climbers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="tapestry.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="tapestry.c4.s40"><qs/>"How shall I call you?"<qe/> asked Hugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="tapestry.c4.p17"><s sid="44" id="tapestry.c4.s44">The peacocks, one on each side of the door, came forward solemnly, saluting the raven with the greatest respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="tapestry.c4.p18" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="tapestry.c4.s45"><qs/>"Ring,"<qe/> said the raven, and to Hugh's surprise each peacock lifted up a claw, and taking hold of a bell-rope, of which there were two, one on each side of the door, pulled them vigorously.</s> <s sid="46" id="tapestry.c4.s46">No sound ensued, but at the instant there burst forth the same soft yet brilliant light which had so delighted Hugh when he first awoke, and which he now discovered to come not from the moon, still shining in gently at the window of the tapestry room down below, but from those of the castle at whose door he was standing.</s> <s sid="47" id="tapestry.c4.s47">He had never before noticed how many windows it had.</s> <s sid="48" id="tapestry.c4.s48">Jeanne and he had only remarked the door at the top of the steps, but now the light which flowed out from above him was so clear and brilliant that it seemed as if the whole castle must be transparent.</s> <s sid="49" id="tapestry.c4.s49">Hugh stood in eager expectation of what was to happen next, and was on the point of speaking to the raven, standing, as he thought, beside him, when a sudden sound made him turn round.</s> <s sid="50" id="tapestry.c4.s50">It was that of the castle door opening, and at the same moment the two peacocks, coming forward, pushed him gently, one at each side, so that Hugh found himself obliged to enter.</s> <s sid="51" id="tapestry.c4.s51">He was by no means unwilling to do so, but he gave one last look round for his conductor.</s> <s sid="52" id="tapestry.c4.s52">He was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="tapestry.c4.p19"><s sid="53" id="tapestry.c4.s53">For about half a second Hugh felt a little frightened and bewildered.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="tapestry.c4.p21" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="tapestry.c4.s56">It was a long, long passage, high in the roof, though narrow of course in comparison with its length, but wide enough for Hugh--for Hugh and Jeanne hand-in-hand even--to walk along with perfect comfort and great satisfaction, for oh, it was so prettily lighted up!</s> <s sid="57" id="tapestry.c4.s57">You have, I daresay, children, often admired in London or Paris, or some great town, the rows of gas lamps lighting up at night miles of some very long street.</s> <s sid="58" id="tapestry.c4.s58">Fancy those lights infinitely brighter and clearer, and yet softer than any lamps you ever saw, and each one of a different colour, from the richest crimson to the softest pale blue, and you will have some idea how pretty the long corridor before him looked to Hugh.</s> <s sid="59" id="tapestry.c4.s59">He stepped along delightedly, as well he might.</s> <s sid="60" id="tapestry.c4.s60"><qs/>"Why, this of itself is worth staying awake ever so many nights to see,"<qe/><sss/> he said to himself; <sse/><qs/>"only I do wish Jeanne were with me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="tapestry.c4.p22"><s sid="61" id="tapestry.c4.s61">Where did the corridor lead to?</s> <s sid="62" id="tapestry.c4.s62">He ran on and on for some time without thinking much about this, so interested was he in observing the lamps and the pretty way in which the tints were arranged; but after a while he began to find it a little monotonous, especially when he noticed that at long intervals the colours repeated themselves, the succession of shades beginning again from time to time.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="tapestry.c4.p23" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="tapestry.c4.s63"><qs/>"I shall learn them by heart if I go on here much longer,"<qe/> thought Hugh.</s> <s sid="64" id="tapestry.c4.s64"><qs/>"I think I'll sit down a little to rest.</s> <s sid="65" id="tapestry.c4.s65">Not that I feel tired of walking, but I may as well sit down a little."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="tapestry.c4.p24"><s sid="66" id="tapestry.c4.s66">He did so--on the ground, there was nothing else to sit on--and then a very queer thing happened.</s> <s sid="67" id="tapestry.c4.s67">The lamps took to moving instead of him, so that when he looked up at them the impression was just the same as when he himself had been running along.</s> <s sid="68" id="tapestry.c4.s68">The colours succeeded each other in the same order, and Hugh began to wonder whether his eyes were not deceiving him in some queer way.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="tapestry.c4.p25" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="tapestry.c4.s69"><qs/>"Anyhow, I'll run on a little farther,"<qe/><sss/> he said to himself, <sse/><qs/>"and if I don't come to the end of this passage soon, I'll run back again to the other end.</s> <s sid="70" id="tapestry.c4.s70">It feels just as if I had got inside a kaleidoscope."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="tapestry.c4.p26"><s sid="71" id="tapestry.c4.s71">He hastened on, and was beginning really to think of turning back again and running the other way, when, all of a sudden--everything in this queer tapestry world he had got into seemed to happen all of a sudden--a little bell was heard to ring, clear and silvery, but not very loud, and in another instant--oh dear!--all the pretty coloured lamps were extinguished, and poor Hugh was left standing all in the dark.</s> <s sid="72" id="tapestry.c4.s72">Where he was he did not know, what to do he did not know; had he not been eight years old on his last birthday I almost think he would have begun to cry.</s> <s sid="73" id="tapestry.c4.s73">He felt, too, all of a sudden so cold, even though before he had got out of bed he had taken the precaution to put on his red flannel dressing-gown, and till now had felt quite pleasantly warm.</s> <s sid="74" id="tapestry.c4.s74">It was only for half a moment, however, that the idea of crying came over him.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="tapestry.c4.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="tapestry.c4.s75"><qs/>"I'm very glad poor little Jeanne isn't here,"<qe/><sls/> he said to himself by way of keeping up his own courage; <sle/><qs/>"she _would_ have been afraid.</s> <s sid="76" id="tapestry.c4.s76">But as I'm a boy it doesn't matter.</s> <s sid="77" id="tapestry.c4.s77">I'll just try to find my way all the same.</s> <s sid="78" id="tapestry.c4.s78">I suppose it's some trick of that Dudu's."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="tapestry.c4.p28"><s sid="79" id="tapestry.c4.s79">He felt his way along bravely for a few minutes, and more bravely still was forcing back his tears, when a sound caught his ears.</s> <s sid="80" id="tapestry.c4.s80">It was a cock's crow, sharp and shrill, but yet sounding as if outside the place where he was.</s> <s sid="81" id="tapestry.c4.s81">Still it greatly encouraged Hugh, who continued to make his way on in the dark, much pleased to find that the farther he got the nearer and clearer sounded the crow, repeated every few seconds.</s> <s sid="82" id="tapestry.c4.s82">And at last he found himself at the end of the passage--he knew it must be so, for in front of him the way was barred, and _quite_ close to him now apparently, sounded the cock's shrill call.</s> <s sid="83" id="tapestry.c4.s83">He pushed and pulled--for some time in vain.</s> <s sid="84" id="tapestry.c4.s84">If there were a door at this end of the passage, as surely there must be--who would make a passage and hang it so beautifully with lamps if it were to lead to nowhere?--it was a door of which the handle was very difficult to find.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="tapestry.c4.p29" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="tapestry.c4.s85"><qs/>"Oh dear!"<qe/><sls/> exclaimed Hugh, half in despair, <sle/><qs/>"what shall I do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="tapestry.c4.p30" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="tapestry.c4.s86"><qs/>"Kurroo--kurroorulloo,"<qe/> sounded the cock's crow.</s> <s sid="87" id="tapestry.c4.s87"><qs/>"Try again,"<qe/> it seemed to say, encouragingly.</s> <s sid="88" id="tapestry.c4.s88">And at last Hugh's hand came in contact with a little round knob, and as he touched it, all at once everything about him was lighted up again with the same clear, lovely light coming from the thousands of lamps down the long corridor behind him.</s> <s sid="89" id="tapestry.c4.s89">But Hugh never turned to look at them--what he saw in front of him was so delightful and surprising.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="tapestry.c4.p31"><s sid="90" id="tapestry.c4.s90">The door had opened, Hugh found himself standing at the top of two or three steps, which apparently were the back approach to the strange long passage which he had entered from the tapestry room.</s> <s sid="91" id="tapestry.c4.s91">Outside it was light too, but not with the wonderful bright radiance that had streamed out from the castle at the other side.</s> <s sid="92" id="tapestry.c4.s92">Here it was just very soft, very clear moonlight.</s> <s sid="93" id="tapestry.c4.s93">There were trees before him--almost it seemed as if he were standing at the entrance of a forest.</s> <s sid="94" id="tapestry.c4.s94">But, strange to say, they were not winter trees, such as he had left behind him in the garden of Jeanne's house--bare and leafless, or if covered at all, covered only with their Christmas dress of snow and icicles--these trees were clothed with the loveliest foliage, fresh and green and feathery, which no winter's storms or nipping frosts had ever come near to blight.</s> <s sid="95" id="tapestry.c4.s95">And in the little space between the door where Hugh stood and these wonderful trees was drawn up, as if awaiting him, the prettiest, queerest, most delicious little carriage that ever was seen.</s> <s sid="96" id="tapestry.c4.s96">It was open; the cushions with which it was lined were of rose-coloured plush--not velvet, I think; at least if they _were_ velvet, it was of some marvellous kind that couldn't he rubbed the wrong way, that felt exquisitely smooth and soft whichever way you stroked it; the body of the carriage was shaped something like a cockle-shell; you could lie back in it so beautifully without cricking or straining your neck or shoulders in the least; and there was just room for two.</s> <s sid="97" id="tapestry.c4.s97">One of these two was already comfortably settled--shall I tell you who it was now, or shall I keep it for a tit-bit at the end when I have quite finished about the carriage?</s> <s sid="98" id="tapestry.c4.s98">Yes, that will be better.</s> <s sid="99" id="tapestry.c4.s99">For the funniest things about the carriage have to be told yet.</s> <s sid="100" id="tapestry.c4.s100">Up on the box, in the coachman's place, you understand, holding with an air of the utmost importance in one claw a pair of yellow silk reins, his tufted head surmounted by a gold-laced livery hat, which, however, must have had a hole in the middle to let the tuft through, for there it was in all its glory waving over the hat like a dragoon's plume, sat, or stood rather, Houpet; while, standing behind, holding on each with one claw to the back of the carriage, like real footmen, were the two other chickens.</s> <s sid="101" id="tapestry.c4.s101">They, too, had gold-laced hats and an air of solemn propriety, not _quite_ so majestic as Houpet's, for in their case the imposing tuft was wanting, but still very fine of its kind.</s> <s sid="102" id="tapestry.c4.s102">And who do you think were the horses? for there were two--or, to speak more correctly, there were no horses at all, but in the place where they should have been were harnessed, tandem-fashion, not abreast, Nibble the guinea-pig and Grignan the tortoise!</s> <s sid="103" id="tapestry.c4.s103">Nibble next to the carriage, Grignan, of all creatures in the world, as leader.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="tapestry.c4.p32"><s sid="104" id="tapestry.c4.s104">On sight of them Hugh began to laugh, so that he forgot to look more closely at the person in the carriage, whose face he had not yet seen, as it was turned the other way.</s> <s sid="105" id="tapestry.c4.s105">But the sound of his laughing was too infectious to be resisted--the small figure began to shake all over, and at last could contain itself no longer.</s> <s sid="106" id="tapestry.c4.s106">With a shout of merriment little Jeanne, for it was she, sprang out of the carriage and threw her arms round Hugh's neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="tapestry.c4.p33" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="tapestry.c4.s107"><qs/>"O Cheri,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"I _couldn't_ keep quiet any longer, though I wanted to hide my face till you had got into the carriage, and then surprise you.</s> <s sid="108" id="tapestry.c4.s108">But it was so nice to hear you laugh--I _couldn't_ keep still."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="tapestry.c4.p34"><s sid="109" id="tapestry.c4.s109">Hugh felt too utterly astonished to reply.</s> <s sid="110" id="tapestry.c4.s110">He just stared at Jeanne as if he could not believe his own eyes.</s> <s sid="111" id="tapestry.c4.s111">And Jeanne did not look surprised at all!</s> <s sid="112" id="tapestry.c4.s112">That, to Hugh, was the most surprising part of the whole.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="tapestry.c4.p35" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="tapestry.c4.s113"><qs/>"Jeanne!"<qe/><sss/> he exclaimed, <sse/><qs/>"you here!</s> <s sid="114" id="tapestry.c4.s114">Why, Dudu told me you were ever so far away."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="tapestry.c4.p36" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="tapestry.c4.s115"><qs/>"And so I am,"<qe/><sss/> replied Jeanne, laughing again, <sse/><qs/>"and so are you, Cheri.</s> <s sid="116" id="tapestry.c4.s116">You have no idea how far away you are--miles, and miles, and miles, only in this country they don't have milestones.</s> <s sid="117" id="tapestry.c4.s117">It's all quite different."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="tapestry.c4.p37" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="tapestry.c4.s118"><qs/>"How do you mean?"<qe/> asked Hugh.</s> <s sid="119" id="tapestry.c4.s119"><qs/>"How do you know all about it?</s> <s sid="120" id="tapestry.c4.s120">You have never been here before, have you?</s> <s sid="121" id="tapestry.c4.s121">I couldn't quite understand Dudu--_he_ meant, I think, that it was only your thinking part or your fancying part, that was away."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="tapestry.c4.p38"><s sid="122" id="tapestry.c4.s122">Jeanne laughed again, Hugh felt a little impatient.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="tapestry.c4.p39" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="tapestry.c4.s123"><qs/>"_Jeanne_,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"do leave off laughing and speak to me.</s> <s sid="124" id="tapestry.c4.s124">What is this place? and how did you come here? and have you ever been here before?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="tapestry.c4.p40" type="speech"><s sid="125" id="tapestry.c4.s125"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said Jeanne, <sse/><qs/>"I think so; but I don't know how I came.</s> <s sid="126" id="tapestry.c4.s126">And I don't want to do anything but laugh and have fun.</s> <s sid="127" id="tapestry.c4.s127">Never mind how we came.</s> <s sid="128" id="tapestry.c4.s128">It's a beautiful country, any way, and did you _ever_ see anything so sweet as the little carriage they've sent for us, and wasn't it nice to see Houpet and all the others?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="tapestry.c4.p41" type="speech"><s sid="129" id="tapestry.c4.s129"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said Hugh, <sse/><qs/>"very.</s> <s sid="130" id="tapestry.c4.s130">But whom do you mean by <alt-qs/>'they,'<alt-qe/> Jeanne?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="tapestry.c4.p42" type="speech"><s sid="131" id="tapestry.c4.s131"><qs/>"Oh dear, dear!"<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Jeanne, <sse/><qs/>"what a terrible boy you are.</s> <s sid="132" id="tapestry.c4.s132">Do leave off asking questions, and let us have fun.</s> <s sid="133" id="tapestry.c4.s133">Look, there are Grignan and the little cochon quite eager to be off.</s> <s sid="134" id="tapestry.c4.s134">Now, do jump in--we shall have such fun."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="tapestry.c4.p43"><s sid="135" id="tapestry.c4.s135">Hugh got in, willingly enough, though still he would have preferred to have some explanation from Jeanne of all the strange things that were happening.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="tapestry.c4.p44" type="speech"><s sid="136" id="tapestry.c4.s136"><qs/>"_Isn't_ it nice?"<qe/> said Jeanne, when they had both nestled down among the delicious soft cushions of the carriage.</s> </p>
